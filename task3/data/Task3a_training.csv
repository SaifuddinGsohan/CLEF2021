Such measures are more than necessary now, as distracted driving has claimed more lives than impaired driving in provinces like British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador. “Mobile phones, even when held by a passenger, can be a dangerous distraction for the driver. Starting next week being distracted by a screen held by a passenger attracts a penalty of $1,500 and three demerit points. “Drivers and screens do not mix – it doesn’t matter who is holding the device. Using FaceTime, taking selfies with the driver or showing the driver a funny cat video is a no-no.” In most provinces a mobile phone is categorised as a “visual display unit”, meaning it is considered akin to a television screen. It’s important to practice safe driving for your own sake and that of your fellow drivers. Canada is cracking down on its distracted driving problem with the rollout of stricter laws that impose harsher penalties and heftier fines on guilty offenders. It’s taking effect as of next week , and it adds serious penalties to those convicted of distracted driving.","You Can Be Fined $1,500 If Your Passenger Is Using A Mobile Phone, Starting Next Week",FALSE
30c605a1,"Missouri politicians have made statements after the mass shooting late Sunday night in Las Vegas.  In a tweet, Republican Senator Roy Blunt said he was saddened by the tragic loss of life and that his thoughts were with the families affected by” this horrific attack”.  Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill issued a statement strongly condemning the action and offering support law enforcement personnel looking into the matter.  “Firing upon a crowd of innocent concert goers is an act of unimaginable evil and my deepest condolences go out to all those affected by this tragic event,” said McCaskill. “I will continue to closely monitor the situation and pledge my support to all local, state, and federal law enforcement officials involved in this investigation.”  Republican Lieutenant Governor Mike Parson, a former Sheriff, praised the response of law enforcement to the shooting spree and expressed regret over the occurrence.  “While my words can be of little comfort to the victims of this senseless act of violence, it should bring comfort to all Americans to see the quick response of local law enforcement and first responders to stop the gunman and help victims, and fellow Americans helping to get others to safety,” Parson said. “My deepest sympathies go out to everyone affected.”  Republican Governor Eric Greitens posted a short message on Facebook, saying “Our prayers are with the people affected by last night’s tragic and evil violence in Las Vegas.”  Republican State Representative Nick Marshall of Parkville is a National Rifle Association member and an outspoken supporter of gun rights. Marshall hasn’t released a formal statement, but when reached for comment by Missourinet, was critical of the inquiry and said the Las Vegas shooter’s use of automatic weapons was not a state issue.  “I can’t believe that we would, within hours of a mass shooting, be talking politics on this. That’s the disturbing thing to me right now to hear about. I get a call from someone who wants to talk about politics in a mass shooting,” said Marshall. “When it comes to automatic weapons, that’s a federal issue as you know.”  Marshall went on to stress the involvement of human shortcomings in the incident. “It’s nothing other than a human tragedy for our country. I think what it shows, it shows we’ve got some serious cultural issues, some serious heart issues in the nation.”  After Governor Greitens had metal detectors installed in the state capitol this year and restricted people from entering with guns, Marshall offered his own an alternative.  On his Facebook page and his office door, Marshall posted the message “effective immediately, any constituent of mine with a CCW that was not allowed to bring his firearm into the Capitol may stop by my office and borrow one for the duration of the visit.”  One of the Missouri legislature’s most fierce proponents of gun restrictions is Democratic Representative Stacy Newman of Richmond Heights. She told Missourinet that Marshall wasn’t exactly correct about federal oversight of automatic weapons, citing 2011 legislation passed by state lawmakers known as House Bill 294.  “Part of this omnibus gun bill that year legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri. We legalized them here. And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction.”  Newman also said voters have failed to hold lawmakers responsible for current laws which allow access to rapid fire weapons. “We elect people and then expect them to change their spots when they are in office. They’re not going to do it because they’re answering to the gun lobby. The gun lobby only cares about more sales. That’s it”.  Austin Petersen, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by McCaskill, expressed sadness over the shooting and asked for unity in overcoming it.  “I’m heartbroken over the tragic event in Las Vegas yesterday,” Petersen said. “This horrendous act of violence touches and hurts us all as a nation and we must come together to heal and find answers. I send my most sincere condolences to all of the victims and their families. Please help and love one another.”  Petersen has criticized Facebook for banning him from the site for 30 days after he posted a live stream video of himself talking about an AR-15 rifle he’s giving away. An AR-15 is a semi-automatic weapon.  During an interview with Missourinet Columbia affiliate KSSZ, Petersen said ban was politically motivated. “Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has donated the maximum amount allowable to my opponent Claire McCaskill, so something’s fishy.”  At least 58 people have died from Sunday night’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, which also injured more than 500 people",Missouri lawmakers condemn Las Vegas shooting,partially false
c3dea290,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is full of violence that, in my opinion, exceeds the physical comedy of the original film and is borderline barbarism. The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That’s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump’s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.  You guys are the biggest bush league “journalists” of all time. Editing out Trump’s cameo in Home Alone 2. What kind of state-sponsored bullshit it that? #Defund — James @Jameseast_ December 23, 2019  https://twitter.com/TEKO8827/status/1209962103295086592  @CBC Cutting Trump from Home Alone 2 is disgusting & your pathetic — Wrestling Fan Forever @617WrestlingFan December 25, 2019  https://twitter.com/ADiMarco25/status/1206364668576579586  According to the CBC, the movie “was edited to allow for commercial time within the format.”  Here’s where that explanation fails to pass the smell test:  Donald Trump formally announced his campaign in June 2015. The first time the CBC’s cutting of Trump’s cameo appearance was acknowledged on Twitter was around Christmas that year:  Thanks @CBC for cutting @realDonaldTrump out of Home Alone 2. — Colt McCaullany???? @DENNISGRIMBLE December 22, 2015  Now, either 2015 happened to be the first year the CBC broadcasted the movie, which I highly doubt, or something happened between the 2014 CBC broadcast of Home Alone 2, and the 2015 CBC broadcast. One could argue that Trump wasn’t a political figure in the public’s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama’s birth certificate—so I don’t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I’m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump’s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can’t decide if this is hilarious or sad.  Update January 2: Just to be clear, the CBC issued a formal statement saying Home Alone 2 was edited in 2014 when they first obtained the rights to the movie.  _____  Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama’s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

f14e8eb6,"But things took a turn for the worse when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd, all to clear the way for President Donald Jebediah Trump to waddle across the street for a photo op in front of a church he doesn’t attend, wave around a copy of a holy book he doesn’t read, and ramble like a psychotic dictator of a country he doesn’t love.  Sasha and Malia had come to the protest equipped with military-grade gas masks, so they were not overcome by the tear gas that crippled so many of their fellow protestors. They stood still in front of the advancing police, trying to give others a chance to escape the rubber bullets and tear gas.  As the police shoved their way through the peaceful crowd, an enraged officer ripped an American flag out of the hands of a group of high school students who were standing silently, holding the flag, and refusing to give up their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble.  Just then, recognizing the Obama daughters, the cop wadded up the flag, lit a corner of it on fire, waved to a news camera from OAN, and threw the burning flag at Sasha and Malia.  The Obamas, horrified to see a flag being burned, stretched it out between them to try to keep more of it from catching fire. That’s when the camera caught the image of them, holding a burning American flag.  Presidential historian Sandy Batt, who has always hated made-up stories about the Obama girls, rolled her eyes and said,  “Oh for god’s sake, people will really think they burned a U.S. flag,” when she was reached for comment.

Governor and Secretary of State in Georgia Took Money From China To Steal Election from Trump  UPDATED 8:23 PM EST See Bottom -- Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp and the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger both allegedly took money from Communist China, perhaps to intentionally THROW or STEAL the November 3 Election in that state, to Joe Biden.  According to very high level sources from my years working National Security Intelligence with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, the feds have PROOF of the payments to both Kemp and Raffensperger.  The Trump election legal team forced the President to WAIT before revealing this, until both Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the Election results.  According to those same sources, once Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the results, their crime was complete. Both men certified those election results this week. By law, Mr. Raffensperger was obliged to certify the election results before 5 p.m. on Friday. Gov. Kemp, had to then certify the results by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Both men did exactly those acts.  The implications of this revelation are staggering. First, that a sitting REPUBLICAN Governor would stab his Party's President, and our nation, in the back, for a foreign government, is utterly horrifying. People are already asking  My God, what could they have offered that he would sell out his own people? His own country?  That a foreign nation would DARE to pay money in order to rig or steal a U.S. Presidential Election is . . . a casus belli Cause for war. China appears to have tried to STEAL our freedom by STEALING our Elections. War is justified.  Again, the national security intelligence sources with whom I have spoken, assure me this information is solid and the proof is already in government hands.  MORE . . .  Georgia Governor Brian P.

61bd9a69,"November 23, 2019  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA has published shocking results which found that cells used in the manufacturing of numerous childhood vaccines are often contaminated with serious viruses including cancer.  The FDA study looked at vaccines that are made from living cells, or replicated cell substrates that some manufacturers are investigating to create. According to research, these cells are oftentimes contaminated with hidden viral fragments which have the potential to cause cancer.  These viruses are dormant, meaning they live “quietly” inside other cells. However, eventually these cells no longer hide and circulate throughout the body in the form of serious disease. As a result, a person injected with a vaccine containing these cancer-causing micro-organisms may not display signs of health complications until long after they have been jabbed sometimes several years later.  .  An experiment injecting rodents with vaccines yielded surprising results showing that the rats now had tumor cells.  “In some cases the cell lines that are used might be tumorigenic, that is, they form tumors when injected into rodents,” the FDA paper explains.  “Some of these tumor-forming cell lines may contain cancer-causing viruses that are not actively reproducing. Such viruses are hard to detect using standard methods. These latent, or ‘quiet,’ viruses pose a potential threat, since they might become active under vaccine manufacturing conditions.”  The list of tumorigenic or cells that run the risk of causing cancer include MDCK and CHO cells for influenza virus vaccines, 293 and PER.C6 cells for adenovirus-vectored HIV-1 and other vaccines, and tumor-derived cells such as HeLa cells for HIV-1 vaccines according to the FDA.  Although this author is against the injection of foreign chemicals into his own body, the FDA proceeded with the study for other reasons. The FDA writes they want “to ensure the safety of vaccines, our laboratory is investigating ways to activate latent viruses in cell lines and to detect the activated viruses, as well as other unknown viruses, using new technologies. We will then adapt our findings to detect viruses in the same types of cell substrates that are used to produce vaccines.”  The FDA adds, “These methods will enable FDA scientists to help manufacturers to determine whether their specific cell substrate is safe to use for vaccine production. The methods our laboratory are developing and testing will help to ensure the production of safe and effective vaccines in two ways: 1 FDA will be able to develop testing guidelines for manufacturers who use new cell substrates for producing vaccines; and 2 FDA will publish the new methods it develops in peer-reviewed scientific journals, thus making them readily accessible to all manufacturers.”  The FDA is also evaluating the risk of retrovirus infections in humans such as Simian foamy virus SFV which can be transmitted from monkeys to humans. Although, the FDA says “there is no evidence that SFV causes disease.” However, the FDA cautions that the virus can “remain in a lifelong quiet state in the DNA after infection.”  Despite these claims, we know that polio and smallpox vaccines contain monkey, pig, kidney and other foreign cells that are contaminated with SIV, SFV, and various other cancer-causing viruses. Most are also well aware that the Polio vaccine SV40 is documented on record by the CDC themselves on a now-deleted page to have cost people their lives and caused cancer. However, you can confirm the web page existed by using Archive.org’s time machine. Also there’s other evidence that SV40 has been detected in some human tumors.  So the claim made by the CDC “there is no evidence that SFV causes disease” is a laughably ill-researched statement.  In other gene sequencing news, recently it has been reported by scientists in a separate study that there are 560 cancer genes in the human gene sequencing for GlaxoSmithKline’s GSK combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella MMRV.  Cancer genes aren’t the only worry with MMR vaccines or vaccines in general. As Activist Post has previously expressed, mercury and aluminum have long been debated by people like Robert Kennedy Jr . as ingredients adjuvants in vaccines that could cause autism. This is for good reason since we know that both aluminum and mercury are neurotoxins that harm the body at high levels.  RFK, Jr. believes “it’s the preservative Thimerosal in the vaccines that causes autism.”  Kennedy expressed his opinion in a weighty now-deleted piece on the CDC whistleblower entitled “CDC’s Latest Tuskegee Experiment African American Autism and Vaccines.” archive  Thiomersal isn’t the only ingredient in vaccines; they have admitted to traces of aluminum, which is classified as a neurotoxin to the body and stated that “despite using it for 90 years medical sciences’ understanding about using aluminum as a vaccine adjuvant is remarkably poor.”  In 2017, Activist Post reported a previous separate study that confirmed aluminum in vaccines may cause Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD, and children who suffer from it have up 10 times more metal in their brains than what is considered a safe amount for adults. Those researchers discovered that aluminum causes the membrane to separate the brain from blood flowing to it, thus affecting its internal temperature, non-neuronal cells and inflammatory cells.  Another previous study in 2012, from the peer-reviewed medical journal Lupus by Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD and Christopher A. Shaw, PhD of the University of British Columbia corroborates those claims , indicating that aluminum toxicity targets the mitochondria. That experiment found evidence that aluminum as an adjuvant can lead to permanent detrimental alterations of the brain and immune system function.  There are several additional court cases; although the CDC and pharmaceutical industry would love to have these covered up, I dug them up. One MMR clinical trial’s results were faked by Big Pharma Merck . Merck knowingly falsified its mumps vaccine test results to fabricate a “95% efficacy rate.” In order to do this, Merck “spiked the blood test with animal antibodies to artificially inflate the appearance of immune system antibodies,” as reported by CourthouseNews.com  In fact, regarding the use of aluminum and other metals in vaccines as an adjuvant, we may all be part of a 90-year-old experiment where we were all the lab rats.      American Natural Superfood - Free Sample Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science’s understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community. We hope that the present paper will provide a framework for a much needed and long overdue assessment of this highly contentious medical issue. – US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health  The MMR vaccine isn’t the only vaccine under scrutiny. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control CDC announced there might be a link between miscarriages and vaccinations. The researchers found that women who had miscarriages between 2010 and 2012 were more likely to have had back-to-back annual flu shots including the Swine flu vaccine that a UK court ruled caused brain damage and Guillain-Barre syndrome GBS in multiple kids in 2015, as Natural Blaze reported.  At this point, the FDA effectively just inadvertently proved that jabbing yourself with a vaccine is the equivalent to trying Chinese research chemicals. Except that these chemical combinations are approved by the FDA. The question on everyone’s minds is, how wasn’t any of this identified long before any of these vaccines were ever approved for use by the masses? Especially, the Polio and Smallpox vaccines which have injured and killed many over the years.  Where at first the problem may have been metallics aluminum used in vaccines that the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health has admitted their understanding of aluminum as a main adjuvant in vaccines is “poor.” The new issue is vaccines that are made from living cells, or replicated cell substrates that may cause cancer or other serious diseases. Despite all this evidence, forced vaccinations are occurring in places like BC where, as Activist Post reported , parents have no choice but to vaccinate. As this writer previously wrote, vaccines affect individuals differently and can have adverse side effects; now parents need to worry about deadly cells hidden beneath the vaccines that can cause illnesses.  Is it ever really safe to put a foreign substance into your body when each person’s body functions differently and has a different chemical make up? As RFK, Jr. says when it comes to vaccines: “Let the evidence speak for itself.”  Steemit, SoMee, BitChute,  Aaron Kesel writes for Activist Post. Support us at Patreon .

Conventional nukes against Japan had 15 to 21 kilotons. But this explosion is different, it is because of modern tactical nuke that contains up to 10 kilotons of the hybrid material including uranium. It is this reason why we still have acid and radiation in the air. The storage facilities near the grain elevator are NOT marked for hazardous material storage, but are instead marked for general cargo. Therefore, you can guess it, what we will be fed in the coming hours.” – Ghayet Ali ” First explosion was caused by Gabriel anti ship missile of Israel. The second explosion was caused by Israeli Delilah missile from F16. Our country is in complete jeopardy with this lazy and corrupt regime.”  Hezbollah, we are told, is expected to retaliate against Israel and they say there is no way for Syria not to be brought in.  Jeff Smith of the IAEA confirms this is a nuclear explosion. The lies about fireworks in ships and fertilizer are what we always get. You don’t store either one downtown in a major city like Beirut under any circumstances. Not much farming in Beirut and they don’t celebrate the 4th of July there.  The smoke could well be missile fuel which may mean a missile storage facility was hit by Israel. We have confirmation from Israel that they were planning to attack Beirut 5 days ago in retaliation for Hezbollah’s military attacks on Golan, which were not reported anywhere.  We are told Lebanon asked for nuclear investigators from Russia but there is no attempt to protect the site which, even if this were a modern clean weapon, still be radioactive.

RT has just covered the explosions and quotes a Lebanese govt. minister:  https://www.rt.com/news/497080-beirut-explosion-lebanon-videos/  Health Minister Hamad Hassan told local media that a ship carrying fireworks exploded in the port. Video footage lends weight to his explanation, as it shows a small explosion followed by the crackling of fireworks, before a second and massively destructive blast.  Local residents have shared images showing extensive damage to property. The office of the Daily Star newspaper was smashed by the blast, with windows blown out and furniture flung to the ground.

Or are they going with the one we have heard so many times before when tactical nukes have been used – that it was a store of explosives that went up:Of course they would deny it was an attack, no-one ever admits a nuke went off, it’s terribly bad for public opinion.

c1dc1ac6,"In a show of anti-American sentiment that will surprise precisely no one, Sasha and Malia Obama were allegedly caught on camera burning a United States flag during a protest in Washington, DC. Kneeling across the street from the White House, they were seen wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts and singing “Amazing Grace” while holding hands with other protestors.  But things took a turn for the worse when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd, all to clear the way for President Donald Jebediah Trump to waddle across the street for a photo op in front of a church he doesn’t attend, wave around a copy of a holy book he doesn’t read, and ramble like a psychotic dictator of a country he doesn’t love.  Sasha and Malia had come to the protest equipped with military-grade gas masks, so they were not overcome by the tear gas that crippled so many of their fellow protestors. They stood still in front of the advancing police, trying to give others a chance to escape the rubber bullets and tear gas.  As the police shoved their way through the peaceful crowd, an enraged officer ripped an American flag out of the hands of a group of high school students who were standing silently, holding the flag, and refusing to give up their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble.  Just then, recognizing the Obama daughters, the cop wadded up the flag, lit a corner of it on fire, waved to a news camera from OAN, and threw the burning flag at Sasha and Malia.  The Obamas, horrified to see a flag being burned, stretched it out between them to try to keep more of it from catching fire. That’s when the camera caught the image of them, holding a burning American flag.  Presidential historian Sandy Batt, who has always hated made-up stories about the Obama girls, rolled her eyes and said,  “Oh for god’s sake, people will really think they burned a U.S. flag,” when she was reached for comment.

da01ca66,"One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword, says the author. | AP photo 4 challenges await Panetta at DOD  Defense Secretary-designate Leon Panetta gained vast government experience as a reform-minded member of the House, where he chaired the Budget Committee. He later served in the White House as President Bill Clinton’s director of the Office of Management and Budget and then chief of staff. He aimed to put America’s financial accounts on a path to balance by the year 2000. He succeeded.  His integrity, lawyerly leadership, razor-sharp mind and affable demeanor will serve our nation, President Barack Obama and the Defense Department well.  Four major challenges await him at DoD:  • Address the wear and tear protracted warfare has exacted on our armed forces  The longest military engagements in U.S. history have achieved exemplary results at significant human cost. Multiple deployments, 5,885 deaths, thousands of permanent disabilities, inadequate dwell time, broken families, historic levels of suicide by soldiers and even family members and more than $2 trillion in treasure — all demand that our nation set firm timetables to complete the military mission and turn operations over to civilian control.  U.S. soldiers should not be expected to do nation-building. Ensuring success halfway around the world requires robust engagement of the world community — starting with neighboring nations whose backyards adjoin the undemocratic societies in which our soldiers bear the burden of order.  One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword. People in those societies should aspire to a better future for themselves — and be willing to sacrifice for it.  • Balance security concerns with budget realities    The need to cut war-induced federal deficits, both in the short term and long term, means that all spending must be on the table — including defense. It now makes up 20 percent of annual federal spending. Military leaders under Panetta must be resourceful, efficient and visionary to save dollars, while keeping our commitment to the troops and without compromising our national security.  The killing of Osama bin Laden is likely to further disrupt the capacity of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, allowing the U.S. to continue to withdraw forces from Iraq and begin an orderly drawdown from Afghanistan. Even so, the U.S. must maintain, as the Obama administration has pledged, a strong and agile military that is well trained and well equipped.  The new secretary recognizes the importance of hard power and soft power and understands that America must not only be militarily strong, but financially sound.  • Reining in the contractors    The increase in the use of contractors demands special scrutiny at the highest levels for three reasons:  a. Morale in the ranks  Insourcing military functions back to DoD is necessary — not just for prudent management of taxpayer dollars but morale in the ranks. When an E5 guard pilot, who enlisted at basic pay, sees contractors earning five times as much and operating by different rules of the road, there is a serious breakdown in the value set of service. Indeed the very meaning of military service changes from “duty” to “job.” Long term, this will corrupt the military code of honor and needs to be reined in now.  b. Security  Significant outsourcing of Pentagon duties to contractors increases the likelihood of security breaches. The military is aware this has even occurred in theater.  I can recall my shock at seeing signs posted in Iraq’s Green Zone: “No Alcohol on Base.” These were meant to curb contractor abuse. But what a poor message this sends to our regular forces. Military service should be exactly that – service to our nation, not one’s wallet.  c. Cost savings  Defense Secretary Robert Gates has left a goal of reducing service-support contractors by 10 percent each year for three years. Yet the FY 2012 budget seems to contradict this goal — since it contains funding to support growing contracted services. DoD proposes spending at least $87.6 billion next year on contracted services — $23.7 billion more than requested in FY 2011 and a 38 percent increase!  This increase in contractor spending flies in the face of a congressionally mandated inventory of contractors that the department has been derelict in providing. Hopefully, this is a lapse that Panetta can rectify early in his tenure.  Regaining U.S. energy independence  The Pentagon, as the largest petroleum user in the world, must lead our nation forward to energy independence. No challenge could be more vital to national security and economic security interests. High fuel costs are causing a hardship on American families, to be sure — but also on our service branches.  Even before the oil companies and Wall Street speculators drove up the price of gasoline close to $4 a gallon, the landed cost of a gallon delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400.  The Marines, the Navy and Navy Secretary Ray Mabus have been pacesetters among the service branches in developing alternatives to petroleum. Mabus told our subcommittee earlier this year, “Energy consumption in the Navy and Marine Corps has become a strategic vulnerability, an operational Achilles’ heel and a readiness challenge.”  The Navy and Marine Corps have set the goal to generate at least 50 percent of all the energy they use come from alternative sources no later than 2020. This is leadership. Panetta would be well served to expand this vision department-wide. Regaining U.S. energy independence is the national security issue of our time.  I look forward to working with Mr. Panetta and our subcommittee as we work together to put the Defense Department on a sustainable path to meet our nation’s vital needs in the 21st century.  Rep. Marcy Kaptur D-Ohio is on the Budget and Defense subcommittees of the House Appropriations Committee.",4 challenges await Panetta at DOD,partially false
2ec747ae,"Submitted by Great Game India  Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.  Coronavirus Bioweapon – How Chinese agents stole Coronavirus from Canada and weaponized it into a Bioweapon  The Saudi SARS Sample  On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.  Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center EMC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice.  Abnormalities on Chest Imaging of the Saudi patient infected with Coronavirus. Shown are chest radiographs of the patient on the day of admission Panel A and 2 days later Panel B and computed tomography CT 4 days after admission Panel C.  Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.  This undated file image released by the British Health Protection Agency shows an electron microscope image of a coronavirus, part of a family of viruses that cause ailments including the common cold and SARS, which was first identified in the Middle East. HANDOUT/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory NML in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.  The Canadian Lab  Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.  Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.  The National Microbiology Lab The Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health on Arlington St. in Winnipeg. Wayne Glowacki/Winnipeg Free Press Oct.22 2014  NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.  This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.  Chinese Biological Espionage  In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.  Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory NML. The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.  Xiangguo Qiu – The Chinese Bio-Warfare Agent  The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.  Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens.  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, the Chinese Biological Warfare Agent working at the National Microbiology Laboratory, Canada  But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra.  Infiltrating the Canadian Lab  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:  Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing  Sources say Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng were escorted from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg on July 5, 2019. Since then, the University of Manitoba has ended their appointments, reassigned her graduate students, and cautioned staff, students and faculty about traveling to China. Governor General’s Innovation Awards  All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006, against Ebola and additional viruses.  However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.  The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.  Dr. Gary Kobinger, former chief of special pathogens right, and Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, research scientist second from right met with Dr. Kent Brantly and Dr. Linda Mobula, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the physician who administered ZMapp to Brantly in Liberia when he was infected with Ebola during the 2014-16 outbreak. Submitted by Health Canada  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.  The Wuhan Coronavirus  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.  Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.  The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located just about 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market, the epicenter of Coronavirus outbreak  The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 BSL-4 standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens.  In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.  Coronavirus Bioweapon  The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.  “Coronaviruses particularly SARS have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”  James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized.  That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”  China’s Biological Warfare Program  In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.  China's Biological Warfare Program is believed to include full range of traditional chemical & biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles. #coronarovirus https://t.co/7qpDNNmqk7 — GreatGameIndia @GreatGameIndia January 25, 2020  China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.  Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.  China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.  Weaponizing Biotech  China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.  The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.  In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.  In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.  Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”",Did China Steal Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponize It?,FALSE
c69de08e,"The proportion of people living in poverty who are in a working family has hit a record high, according to a report that shows rising levels of employment have failed to translate into higher living standards.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that while paid employment reduces the risk of poverty, about 56% of people living in poverty in 2018 were in a household where at least one person had a job, compared with 39% 20 years ago.  Seven in 10 children in poverty are now in a working family, the charity’s annual UK poverty report found.  Single-parent families have been the worst affected by the trend of wages falling behind living costs, it added. Working single parents accounted for three in 10 households in poverty in 2018, compared with two in 10 in 2011.  The JRF’s executive director, Claire Ainsley, said the charity’s latest barometer of poverty in the UK revealed the scale of the task facing Boris Johnson’s administration if it is to “level up” incomes across the UK by narrowing the gap between the wealthiest cities and poorer regions.  “The new government has a historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s,” she said. “Past successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel, and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.”  Amid concerns that the poorest receive worse healthcare and have the most insecure jobs, Ainsley said it was an indictment of recent government policy that the number of people in poverty across the whole workforce jumped from 9.9% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2018.  Labour accused the government of allowing too many people to remain trapped in low-paid insecure work and “all too often the social security system fails to give people the support they need”.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs. Zero-hour contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least £10 an hour right away.”  Approximately 14 million people are in poverty in the UK – more than one in five of the population, including 4 million children and 2 million pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years.  A family is classified as being in poverty if it has an income of less than 60% of the median income for their family type, after housing costs. A family’s income includes earnings from employment, self-employment, state benefits and inheritances.  The report said people were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.  The worst-hit regions were London, the north of England, the Midlands and Wales, while the lowest poverty rates were found in the south of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the JRF said.  The charity was especially concerned about the rise in young people living with their parents, who in a previous era would have started to buy a house and start a family of their own, which it named “concealed households”.  Twenty years ago, 20% 2.4 million of 20- to 34-year-olds lived with a parent or guardian. That proportion rose to 30% in 2018, affecting 3.9 million people, the JRF found.  The report describes in-work poverty as a “critical issue for our economy” and calls for action to reduce job insecurity, lower housing costs and increase earnings for low-paid workers.  The JRF said the introduction of universal credit, which rolls six benefits into one, did not help many low-income families because it required upfront payments for childcare before households were able to access state support.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. We know that getting into work is the best route out of poverty – and there are more people in work than ever before. Wages are outstripping inflation and absolute poverty is lower than in 2010.  “We know that some need more help, which is why we spend over £95bn a year on working-age benefits. Millions will see their benefit payments rise further from April and we’re also boosting the incomes of pensioners each year through the triple lock.”",Number of people in poverty in working families hits record high,FALSE
b8437efb,"U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Stands Up for Wisconsin Dairy Farmers  Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act fights back against non-dairy products that are mislabeled as milk, yogurt and cheese  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin applaud the reform  WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin stood up for Wisconsin dairy farmers and introduced legislation today to combat the unfair practice of mislabeling non-dairy products. The Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act DAIRY PRIDE Act would require non-dairy products made from nuts, seeds, plants, and algae to no longer be mislabeled with dairy terms such as milk, yogurt or cheese.  “Dairy farmers in Wisconsin work tirelessly every day to ensure that their milk meets high standards for nutritional value and quality,” said Senator Baldwin. “Imitation products have gotten away with using dairy’s good name for their own benefit, which is against the law and must be enforced. Mislabeling of plant-based products as ‘milk’ hurts our dairy farmers. That’s why I’ve authored the DAIRY PRIDE Act to take a stand for Wisconsin farmers and the quality products they make.”  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin are strongly supporting Senator Baldwin’s reform:  “Finally after all these years, it’s about time someone stands up for the American Dairy farmer. We are held to higher quality and animal care standard every year to keep milk safe. It’s not fair that the name milk should be used by non-dairy drinks to further erode what little profit we have,” said Jerry Croes, member of the Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery in Deer Park, WI.  “As a proud Wisconsin Dairy Farmer, I support Tammy Baldwin’s efforts to introduce the DAIRY PRIDE Act. I know the economic struggles we dairy farmers face on a daily basis, as I am also an Ag Lender, helping through the low milk prices of 2015 and 2016. We don’t need competition from plant-based drinks being labeled as milk and sending a false message to consumers, and also falsely advertising them as being better than cow’s milk. When compared on nutrients and price, cow’s milk still comes out on top. I am opposed to all false labeling of food products that aren’t true dairy products,” said Jim Smidel of Brothers Smidel Farms, LLP in Kewaunee, WI.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, the increasingly common practice of labeling beverages as milk when they quite obviously are not is wrong and misleading. Senator Baldwin’s bill simply asks FDA to enforce current regulations meant to uphold the standards of identity, and integrity, of milk,” said Brad Nevin, Dairy farmer and member-owner of Associated Milk Producers Inc. AMPI in Rice Lake, WI.  “Consumers deserve to be treated with respect and that begins with proper and accurate food labels. Milk is clearly defined by the FDA, and this definition should also be enforced. It’s about time the FDA upheld its responsibility of enforcing existing labeling requirements, especially when it comes to dairy,” said John Rettler of Tin Valley Farms in Neosho, WI.    “Dairy has built a strong reputation as a reliable source of important nutrients we need daily. To use these dairy terms on plant-based products undermines the real value that dairy provides in the form of naturally occurring Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin A among others. Consumers associate dairy with the nutrients they need, and those are naturally occurring in milk from cows,” said Janet Clark of Vision Aire Farms in Eldorado, WI.  “Thank you, Senator Baldwin, for taking the initiative to protect the definition of milk, cheese and yogurt. Your advocacy supports the hard and honest work of dairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the nation, and more importantly, supports clear and accurate information to be shared on food labels, something consumers deserve,” said David Cooper, General Manager of FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison, WI.  “The FDA has already clearly defined milk, and liquid from a plant does not fit this definition. Existing regulation should be enforced, reserving the use of the term ‘milk’ exclusively for those products that deliver the nutritional value only found in dairy. We thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership on this matter,” said Mark Frederixon, Blair Division Manager of Associated Milk Producers Inc. AMPI in Blair, WI.  Dairy producer coalitions and groups around the country are also applauding the legislation:  “For too long, the FDA has turned a blind eye to the misbranding of imitation dairy products, despite the decades-old federal law that milk comes from animals, not vegetables or nuts. None of these imitators provides the same high quality and quantity of nutrition offered by real milk. Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act will simply ensure that FDA enforces current law by requiring marketers of these imitation products to call them something other than milk,” said Jim Mulhern, President and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation.  “Dairy farmers invest a great deal of time and money to produce a wholesome, nutritious product for consumers, and take pride in the milk they produce. The federal government has promised to ensure that the term “milk” on store shelves can only be used on dairy products. But they have fallen short on that promise. The bill introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin will help ensure that products labeled as milk are indeed dairy products. Consumers and dairy farmers alike will be the beneficiaries of this effort,” said Steve Etka of the Midwest Dairy Coalition.  The Wisconsin Dairy Products Association. which represents processors that manufacture a wide range of dairy products, supports Senator Baldwin’s legislation which protects the integrity and image of wholesome and nutritious dairy products, said Bradley Legreid, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Dairy Products Association.  Wisconsin Farmers Union fully supports the introduction and swift passage of the DAIRY PRIDE Act. Our grassroots, member-driven policy opposes any changes in the FDA definition of milk, cheese or other products made with milk and opposes the use of the word milk to designate any product not derived from mammals, Darin Von Ruden, President of the Wisconsin Farmers Union.  “National Farmers Union supports policy that encourages the healthy consumption of real dairy products and prevents the mislabeling of imitation and substitute dairy products in the marketplace. We appreciate Senator Baldwin’s leadership on the DAIRY PRIDE Act and her commitment to our nation’s dairy producers,” said Roger Johnson, President of the National Farmers Union.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, dairy imitators do not naturally provide the same level of nutrition as milk does,” said Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “We look forward to working with Senator Baldwin on this important legislation.”  “Cooperative Network strongly supports efforts to protect the integrity of dairy products by requiring national enforcement of the sensible labeling requirements we already have on the books. When misbranded items are corrected, we believe consumers will choose real dairy products over imitations, which will benefit Wisconsin’s vital $43 billion dollar dairy industry,” said Tom Liebe, President and CEO of the Cooperative Network.  “We applaud the efforts of Senator Baldwin to ensure that non-dairy foods are not inaccurately labeled as milk, cheese or yogurt. Our dairy farmers and processors work hard to produce incredible food. Milk and other real dairy products offer an almost unbeatable level and variety of nutrition. Mislabeling non-dairy foods confuses people buying these products and misleads them about the nutritional value of the items they purchase. It also hurts dairy farmers and related businesses. This bill is simply asking the FDA to adequately enforce the laws already on the books. It’s a small step that could have a very big positive impact,” said John Holevoet, Director of Government Affairs, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act is also supported by Bongards Creameries, Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery, First District Association, Dairy Business Association, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative, FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative, Mid-west Dairymen's Company and Scenic Central Milk Producers.  Current Food and Drug Administration FDA regulations define dairy products as being from dairy animals. Although existing federal regulation are clear, the FDA has not enforced these labeling regulations and the mislabeling of products as ‘milk’, ‘yogurt’ and ‘cheese’ has increased rapidly. This hurts dairy farmers that work tirelessly to ensure their Made in Wisconsin dairy products meet FDA standards and provide the public with nutritious food. It has also led to the proliferation of mislabeled alternative products that contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act would require the FDA to issue guidance for nationwide enforcement of mislabeled imitation dairy products within 90 days and require the FDA to report to Congress two years after enactment to hold the agency accountable for this update in their enforcement obligations.

43b52abb,"A recent military study shows military personnel evaluated who received the flu vaccine were at 36 percent increased risk for coronavirus with varied benefit in preventing some strains of the flu.  “Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively Table 5.”  The flu vaccine studied demonstrated varied benefit in flu prevention – – some strains showed significant benefit while others did not.  Titled, Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season, the report on the study addresses the phenomena of vaccine virus interference of the influenza vaccine.  Flu Vaccine Interference  Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body’s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally “may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses…”  Due to the flu vaccine’s “interference” with the naturally occurring biological process, there may be an increased risk of contracting non-influenza viruses:  “While influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.”  Why This Topic?  I started digging into this topic on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ VA advice two weeks ago when I noticed the agency’s top advice about coronavirus was to “get a flu shot”.  This advice seemed a bit too simplistic when given to a population of largely elderly veterans with significant disabilities, vaccine histories, and exposures to various pathogens worldwide.  After writing about it, one reader sent an email citing this study in PubMed.  I was later provided a copy of the full study and reviewed it with an expert to verify my own conclusions based on the information in that report.  Informed Consent For Flu Vaccine  Now, the feedback I received that really caught my attention was mainly in a question: Is the heightened risk of coronavirus and other pathogens worth the benefit of the influenza vaccine based on this study as broken down in Table 5 above?  The column to focus on is “OR” in Table 5.  Coronavirus is 1.36 meaning 36% higher risk.  The influenza virus overall is 0.57 meaning the risk of contracting the flu was reduced overall. Three variants of flu did not receive a statistically significant reduction in risk.  Three of 8 evaluations noted a statistically insignificant benefit for the flu shot. Meanwhile, shot takers were at increased risk for coronavirus of 36%. I would bet $1 that this year, many Americans would likely rethink taking the vaccine with that bit of information.  If VA has this information, and they likely do, should the agency be required to share this increased risk factor with individuals considering the shot?  Studied Military Population  The study, published in the scientific journal Vaccine January 2020, was conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch Air Force Satellite at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Taken at face value, the study indicates people who receive the flu vaccine are at increased risk for coronavirus pre-COVID-19. Like veterans, current service members, school teachers, and medical professionals, the study population consisted of a population with a history of being heavily vaccinated.  “The DoD provides a unique population for vaccination studies as mandatory vaccination against influenza is required by the DoD for all Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel. This study aims to examine the relationship between specific respiratory viruses and influenza vaccination. The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board.”  Future § 1151 Claims For Malpractice?  Will veterans who contract the coronavirus after receipt of the flu vaccine based on VA’s top recommendation be eligible for § 1151 claims for malpractice?  How will the US Court of Claims – Vaccine Court handle an influx of US citizens injured by contracting the coronavirus due to the significant risk in the study?  Given that this report was published by DOD researchers in a scientific journal, why is VA telling veterans to get the influenza vaccine?  What is the motive behind their advice?  Veterans, and many disabled veterans, may be at higher risk of contracting coronavirus based on vaccine history alone. That is especially true for veterans who took the flu vaccine at the encouragement of VA doctors.  Who stands to gain with the current recommendation?  There are winners and losers with each of these decisions. The virus itself appears to more severely impact the elderly, of which the veteran population has many.  How about Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides?  This virus is basically a death sentence for our poorly treated disabled Vietnam veterans who rely on VA to provide safe and effective medical care for their diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc.  Ask Your Doctor  I encourage all readers to do your own research. Ask your VA medical doctor about this study and whether they agree with the blanket recommendation of the agency to get a flu shot to get ahead of coronavirus.  Is this solid medical advice?  For those interested, the study’s data came from the Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program DoDGRS is a DoD-wide program established by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System GEIS.  The individuals included in the study provided respiratory specimens to the DoDGRS for 2017-2018 influenza season. Individuals who were sick prior to receipt of the flu vaccine were excluded from the study:  “All people submitting a respiratory specimen to the DoDGRS for the 2017–2018 influenza season were eligible for the study. The influenza season began 1 October 2017 and ended 29 September 2018. Those who submitted a sample and only tested positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae and/or Mycoplasma pneumoniae were excluded because these illnesses are bacteriological in nature, not viral. People with influenza and non-influenza coinfections were excluded because they could not be uniquely classified as either influenza or non-influenza respiratory virus. Individuals with multiple specimens collected during the season were also removed from the study as they could have had multiple different viruses over the season. Specimens where neither vaccination status could be obtained via databases nor a questionnaire was completed were excluded because vaccination status could not be confirmed. Subjects who were ill before receiving vaccination were excluded as vaccination status would therefore be unrelated to illness. Lastly, those people for whom the laboratory rejected the specimen were not included in the final study population.”  Be Optimistic But Careful  From what I can tell, the odds of being exposed in the US are high. The death rate if you get sick is high enough to warrant concern.  Wouldn’t it be nice to get good advice from the socialized healthcare system managed by the VA that is supposed to provide us with care?  For some non-US centric news about the virus, I wanted to include a YouTube video of 60 Minutes Australia about their perspective on the disease.  Now, this video pushes the narrative that the disease originated from the wet markets in Wuhan that also happened to be located near the level 4 biological laboratory studying the virus. I do not believe we know enough to confirm whether the origin is from such markets or manmade.  Getting Your Flu Shot?  I am personally not getting the flu shot and do not plan on taking any vaccines moving forward beyond what I was forced to take in the military due to vaccine injury.  What are your thoughts? Getting the flu shot to get ahead?",Flu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study,other

Opening statewide next week, the clubs seek to provide fast and convenient exotic entertainment in a familiar setting. The move marks a strategic business turn that aims to expand Kwik Trip’s existing portfolio and increase revenue across the board.  “We think there is an untapped market for folks who want to be able to gas up their cars, pick up a few essentials, grab that greeting card they forgot, and then get a quick lap dance from one of our coworkers, perhaps while enjoying a roller dog or nachos,” said Charles Winscomb, head of Kwik Strip sales and marketing.  “Plus, the name is recognizable as well as effective, like ‘Hey honey, I’m just gonna head to Kwik Strip, be right back.’ Did I say Kwik Trip? Strip? It all sounds similar, leaving a kind of gray area as to where exactly I’m going,” Winscomb added.  Company officials say there is a viable market for fast and convenient exotic entertainment and believe traditional gentlemen’s clubs and other forms of adult entertainment are outdated.  “Sneaking off to some questionable roadside club in the middle of nowhere at 1:30 A.M. on a Saturday night when your wife’s already in bed thinking you’re catching up on SNL is now a thing of the past. Not that I would know anything about that per se,” said Winscomb.  Kwik Strip will retain some popular Kwik Trip brands, but in a repurposed fashion.  Customer favorite The Hot Spot will no longer serve warm grab-and-go food items but instead serve as a location for private shows and lap dances by a performer named Karuba Gold.  Nature’s Touch, a familiar line of kitchen essentials, will be repackaged as Nature’s No-Touch Policy, which is standard practice in most gentlemen’s clubs.

2d0f41d8,"WHEELING — At least $53 million a week in illegal drugs cross the Mexican border into the U.S. each week, and more border agents are needed at the U.S.-Mexican border to stop this, according to U.S. Rep. David B. McKinley.  McKinley, R-W.Va., recently traveled to the U.S.-Mexican border to learn about the issue there first hand. He visited the McAllen, Texas region in the Rio Grande District of the U.S. Border Patrol.  He commended the work of the border agents.  “They put themselves in danger and try to keep the border clean and secure. They’ve done that for decades,” McKinley said. “What has compounded this is the humanitarian crisis. We didn’t always have so many people trying to cross illegally.”  The agents attempt to still do their security job, put many are being pulled off the line to take care of the humanitarian crisis.  While at the border, McKinley learned a Mexican drug cartel controls happenings at the border.  He spoke with immigrants detained at the border who told him they paid the cartel anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 to get them across the border. Often, part of the deal is that the immigrant carry illegal drugs with them on the journey.  If the immigrants are captured, they are sent back to their village and must start over again and seek help from the cartel, McKinley said.  “One of the border officers said they the cartel might be making as much money on this as they are on drugs,” he said.  Border guards have a lot of tools to help track immigrants crossing into the U.S., even if they don’t have the manpower to stop all of them, according to McKinley.  The entire U.S.-Mexico border is about 2,000 miles long, while the Rio Grande District agents focus on a specific 300-mile area. Sections of the Rio Grande River are narrow, and often the water is so low immigrants can walk across it. Border guards showed McKinley the footsteps in the mud where some had walked across the night before.  Where there isn’t a wall, cameras and sensors are placed to indicate when an immigrant is coming across the border.  But the cartel knows when agents could be as far as 10 miles away from a possible passage and unable to stop it. That’s when they help immigrants cross into the U.S., according to McKinley.  Nearly a million immigrants were stopped at the border before entering the U.S. last year, he said. Rio Grande District agents were responsible for 399,000 of the arrests, but they know from their technology they missed at least 47,000 immigrants in their crossing.  Many of these immigrants entering the U.S. carried opioids, according to McKinley.  “Border agents say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,” he said.  To compare, the state of West Virginia recently received $28 million for opioid rehabilitation, treatment and education.  “Almost twice that amount comes across the border each week — to put it into perspective,” McKinley said.",Rep.

Keep up to date with our latest:  An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.  Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power!  Going into effect Sunday, Feb. 14, Emergency Order 202-21-1 shows the Energy Dept. was aware of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide disaster declaration and that ERCOT was readying gas utilities in preparation for a demand surge.  The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output, instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.  “ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits,” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”  Moreover, the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,” an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.  On Wednesday, the Dallas Business Journal reported, “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1,137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February, up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020, according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. That’s a jump of more than 6,000 percent.”  Days later, the Public Utility Commission of Texas set prices at $9,000/MWh.

Before the challenge, Northern Ireland was the only UK country that didn’t take up the 1967 Abortion Act – meaning that terminations were only legally permitted in instances where the life or mental health of the mother was in danger.  Anyone who performed an illegal termination faced the prospect of life imprisonment in jail.  But a challenge to the legal ruling was brought in July by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commision NIHRC – who wanted to legalise terminations in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality.

7c9af097,"In Brief The Facts: It is alleged by many in the spiritual community that something called 'THE EVENT' will play out that will either bring about a great awakening and the end of an era of struggle and captivity for humanity.  Reflect On: Why do we always hear of events that involve humanity sitting around and waiting for something? Why is it that we never have to take responsibility for our part in something? We are here, not to wait for a saviour, but to take action within the self.  You probably have been hearing about ‘The Event’, in articles, vlogs and conversation. All around the internet are preparing people for what some are calling the ascension event that will suddenly wake everyone up and end all of the cabal behavior on the planet.  There’s a lot to say about this, and a lot of helpful info we can consider to bring ourselves to a point of understanding as well as practicality, i.e. what we can do. My intention here isn’t to burst any bubbles about this, but to bring us back to an authentic place within ourselves and also back to our intuition.  One final thing, over the course of the past 10 years I’ve not shared much about where I get my info, what I’ve been tapped into since I was younger, the practices I use and how I’ve practiced to truly develop some of these skills. I’ve kept more quiet because I personally like to fly under the radar; simply be myself, remain quiet and live the change and my truth. I don’t believe in having to be loud about our abilities to convince others of who we are. Tapping into intuition, having a strong connection 24 hours a day to my higher self, hearing beings, ‘downloading’ or visually seeing and connecting with peoples lives, getting consistent info downloads etc, these are all a natural part of my life but it’s not something that makes me or anyone else special. It’s simply part of developing it. Some of us may start with different ‘abilities’ more activated, but we can always develop things. CE wasn’t built the way it was simply by using my mind to figure things out, it took diligent conscious practice and intuition to know what was most serving for humanity and when. To take complex conscious ideas and make them reach a mass audience and create virality.  I share this because, we seem to be at a time where confusion is high, disinformation is even higher, and many of us aren’t truly practicing the information we are hearing about or learning. So I share this as what I’m about to convey below is important and I don’t wish to reduce the content to simply ‘I’ve done research,’ these truths come from deeper places. The same places you can access through heart based living and a solid connection to your higher self.  I believe we need to ‘cut the crap’ when it comes to all the identification with “I’m an intuitive,” “I’m an empath,” “I’m a channeller” etc, and realize we all have those abilities within us if we choose to awaken by practice. It’s time for true empowerment ??  What Has Been Said About ‘The Event’  First let’s begin with what’s being said. It is being called a breakthrough for the planet that will cause a number of different unfoldments. Some say the defeat and arrest of the cabal, resetting of financial systems, disclosure of ET’s, aliens coming to the planet, revelation of new and advanced technologies, new governments and political systems etc.  It’s being claimed that on the non physical plane: there will be a “big wave or flash of energy and light coming from the Galactic Central sun going towards the surface of the planet”. The galactic central sun is an object in the Sagittarius constellation. The energy from the Central Sun will stimulate a flash or special kind of light from the Sun that permeates the earth and humanity, raising the frequencies of all living entities on the planet.  It is said that it will not be a major negative event but one that is positive. Some are even suggesting to prepare with several weeks of food and supplies as it may knock out our current infrastructures. It’s also being said that this wave of energy will be soooo powerful that it will literally fry people’s brains and make them go crazy.  I have a lot to say about all of this.  First, A Note On Channeling  From what I have gathered, most people are learning ‘channeling’ information about this from various sources or beings out there. This of course is a real thing and completely possible, but there are caveats that we often don’t consider. I’ve experienced some very good, very talented channellers who are tapped right in to authentic stuff, then again I’ve also seen the opposite.  In a lot of ways I have always steered people away from channeling. Mainly because it takes a level of mastery to truly understand and feel out what one is tapping into. Not only that, much of the time the information you can get from your higher self is more than enough to keep you rolling, and it has nothing to do with channeling. Your connection to your higher self is constant if you practice. The desire to jump deep into channeling can sometimes come from an egoic desire to want to see the future, know the future or even in some ways.. have a ‘super power’ of sorts. I’m not saying there is anything wrong with this, but more so that this can be what pushes us to want it. Like I said above, of course there are many authentic channellers out there as well.  Over the 10 years I have been exploring and observing different channellers, I’ve noticed a lot of the same thing. Repeating the same stuff over and over again, repeating vague and often obvious things, noticing that the channelled info is simply coming from the mind of the channeller and not actually from another being or source etc. From a personal point of view, my message has always been about going within, instead of focusing so much attention on getting information like this from outside ourselves.  From a listener point of view, there is general curiosity which is a beautiful thing, but sometimes we also start jumping into the idea of wanting to know what’s going to happen, being aware of the future and what’s coming… so as to control things or be able to prepare. This can be helpful at times, but it can also be a source of getting us stuck or limited. It also resembles a faith based, religious-like mentality where we take word of what is to come, and then act on that, without ever checking how we feel inside. The way I’ve practiced over the years is, my primary source 85% – 90% of where I get my information like this is from my own self or higher self, my secondary source would be corroborating information with various sources out there like other people, channellers, intuitives etc etc. I feel this is a more ideal course of action as it asks YOU to develop your own knowing and connection with & to your higher self. This is part of an authentic path towards shifting consciousness when we take action and make the necessary changes from within.  The Reality Of What’s Happening  I made a film several years ago called The Collective Evolution III: The Shift. It is all about the shift in consciousness taking place, what’s going on and where humanity is headed. It’s presented in a way that can be passed across any group; those that view things through science, spirituality or who are on the fence. The purpose of the film was to bring these understandings to a grounded and practical space, where much of the human experience exists at this time. In the film, I go into great detail about the cosmic ray portion of the shift, which much of The Event refers to. I’d recommend watching the film for further understanding, but will also elaborate below.  The shift we’re experiencing is ongoing. MANY waves have already hit our planet and are still coming. This has been happening for years and it is PART of what is causing so many of the changes we are seeing today. Shifts in the way people think, shifts in how our world works, insurgence of equality, the calls for changes in our financial systems, political systems and so forth.  These waves have been happening for decades and have been intensifying as we go. They are made up of cosmic bursts from our sun, the galactic sun, surrounding stars and so forth. All cosmic waves carry unique energies with unique signatures and information. This information carries the ability to evolve thought, ideas, DNA, change energy signatures and so forth. But it’s also important to note that this energy has be ‘throttled’ in a sense, through our agreement, and for good reason. More on this in a second.  THE EVENT is following the same path as many other claims like this. It makes this shift in consciousness about ONE thing, ONE moment and so forth. Much like we did with 2012.  Many claim “nothing happened in 2012” because they were looking for something physical and were looking for something HUGE to happen. Yet energies did in fact shift in big ways in and around the 2012 dates many were talking about. But they also shifted in ways prior to that, and after that as well. This shift is a process and one that will continue to unfold over time little by little. Yes many of us are wearing a bit thin as this intensifies, but this simply means we have work to do and it might be harsh to accept but if I’ve witnessed a prominent practice in the overall spiritual movement it’s not practicing what we preach. “I know that information already!” But are you doing it?  Continuing on here, yes, bigger events will continue to take place and mass ‘traumas’ will be experienced as we are challenged with big time change, but we won’t bite off more than we can chew. I say traumas to describe what will feel like very tough times for many people as we realize, en masse, things like the existence of a cabal, how we’ve been systematically manipulated our entire lives, our spiritual connection hindered on purpose etc. This will be tough until we work through it all. Hence traumatic feelings.  Humanity often feels like we are victim to things we experience. Energies, beings, events happening, other people etc, but we choose and agree to things and take them on as we are ready for them. This doesn’t mean that being ready for it won’t cause some pain, the idea isn’t avoiding pain. With pain we often get growth. Suffering comes when we choose to ignore the growth that can be presented to us through pain.  I know that idea doesn’t sit well with some of us but ask the question, where does sitting with pain and holding onto it forever lead us? Even from a logical perspective, the answer is to work past it and grow from it, as lingering only creates more suffering.  It has been 10 years since I founded Collective Evolution and began working in the consciousness space. During that time I have created a conscious media and education company CE, 4 films in the consciousness space and have met many spiritual teachers from around the world for interviews, as friends and so forth. I also have diligently practiced exploring consciousness through sober means, developing my intuition and so forth. In my courses I spread the message of authentic change from within that is built around truly shifting your consciousness so your connection to self and your way of being is automatic, not built on acting from belief systems.  From this space I share simply that the overwhelming feeling points to the fact that humanity is on a journey, one that may be slow at times, but challenges US to be the ones that take action. We must take action from within to shift ourselves; it’s through that space within ourselves that we begin to take action to shift our external world.  Much like we see when we do EVERYTHING for someone and never challenge them to do their own work and suddenly they don’t quite learn and aren’t empowered in their own way, we are on that journey with the shift we face personally as well. Although it’s tempting to view a single event as something that will come in and do the bulk of the work for us, this isn’t going to happen simply because it doesn’t serve us. This is a gradual process.  We’re here to do the work within ourselves. Yes, energies will come in and assist with that process as the sun and central sun act as a purveyors of evolution, but it’s also up to us. Beings are already watching and assisting closely in slowing down many of the energies coming in due to the fact that they are a bit too intense for our consciousness at the moment. This is primarily because many of us aren’t actually practicing what we are learning. We read books, learn about things and then go on living in the same old ways. We don’t shift our diets, we don’t practice meditation or presence, we don’t disempower the ego and we don’t live from our hearts, even though we know this will lead us to a thriving world.  Partly this happens because our current world is intense. There is a lot of work being done to keep us stuck, keep us distracted and so forth. But this is simply presented as an added challenge, to help build our strength within ourselves. We CAN DO IT, otherwise we wouldn’t have bit off this much. Remember that.  Don’t Wait, It’s Now  More than waiting or focusing on a single event, look at what we have right here, right now – in our world and within ourselves. This is truly all we have to focus on, and as you have intuitive feelings towards other things, follow them. But remember to not get fixated on events, dates and promises that claim to come in and take care of everything for us. NOW is most important. Our financial systems, political systems, technologies and so forth will shift and evolve as we do.. it’s not one before the other. Remember quantum physics? We determine our external reality based on how our consciousness projects our world. How do we project a thriving world if we don’t do the internal work first to shift our consciousness? Our outside world simply reflects us. For it to shift, we must do so first.  Are you doing what you love in your life and living from a space where you follow your hearts desires? Are you practicing the observation of the ego and continually shifting from egoic consciousness to heart based living? Are you practicing meditation to reduce over-thinking and more presence? Are you treating others in a way you would want to be treated.. as much as you can, not just sometimes? Are you choosing to empathize and understand where people are at and why vs judging them and calling them names?  All of these things are ways to move towards living in the heart. It’s about going from the mind, to the heart.  Some Key Reflections  When it comes to beings/aliens, remember that in many ways they are just souls having an experience and they may or may not have had experiences as humans. Their advice sometimes may be missing some key details on what it means to be human.  Beings are not ‘above us’. Aliens are not ‘above us.’ We don’t need to bring the mentality in that humans are some primitive culture, as this brings about judgement most of the time. We are all just having experiences, and in many ways we teach things to these other beings just as they teach us.  What can you do right now to practice living in your heart and make that a daily state of being?  Getting or hearing information from outside of yourself is great, and it’s part of how we use one another to learn. Are you checking within yourself about whether or not things are true? How does it feel for you when you know it’s true?",Scientist Explains Why He Believes Aluminum Is “Almost Certainly” Playing A Role in Autism,FALSE
0f086930,"CONTACT: Bryan Kennedy, 414 517-3864  Milwaukee — Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn today made the following statement criticizing Scott Walker for his failed economic policies, as Walker prepares to announce his campaign for re-election tomorrow.  “Scott Walker’s time is up. Average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle. For the first time in decades, Wisconsin has fallen behind the rest of the country in terms of economic growth.  “Walker depressed Wisconsin wages by passing Act 10, Right To Work, and the repeal of the prevailing wage. Everybody is working for less, union or non-union, public sector or private sector. Less money in workers’ pockets means less consumer spending, and less economic growth.  “Walker also refused to accept the very tax dollars Wisconsinites sent to the federal government, including upwards of $500 million for BadgerCare and over $800 million for trains. Instead, he is making taxpayers invest $3 billion in a Chinese company, said they didn’t need to follow the same environmental laws Miller Brewing and Harley Davidson follow, and is pushing it through his corrupt Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation without the public ever seeing the contract.  “When Walker says Wisconsin is ‘open for business’ it means his integrity and campaign coffers are open for business. And while it’s been very good for his fundraising operations, his record has been a nonstop disaster for Wisconsin families. For the right-wing views of his party, he has sacrificed our state.  “The most important issue in this race is improving wages for Wisconsin workers. Scott Walker has been governor for nearly eight years now, and he’s looking to extend it to twelve. We all know he’s just sitting there as he makes plans for his own future. Instead, it’s time to elect a governor who will focus on what really matters, creating economic activity that drives wages up again.”",Flynn campaign: Statement on Walker campaign announcement,partially false

By December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March.  “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.  “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said.  Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize.  Government data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019.  Countrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County.  Clark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.  In one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself.  The alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore.  “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”  Dr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely.  An indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.

In order to stem any conflicts resulting from disagreements among “politically charged” attendees, the organization is effectively banning the wearing of certain articles of clothing bearing political symbols or slogans, including the popular red “Make America Great Again” cap favored by fans of *President Donald Trump.  The announcement broke early on Sunday, spreading across social media, mostly finding anger and consternation in Facebook groups and pages for conservative mental patients who support the morbidly obese failure like Russian prostitutes laughing while they’re being urinated on.

c5175d8d,"Gov. Scott Walker said Friday his presidential campaign remains $1 million in the red, despite a spurt of fundraising in the final quarter of 2015. Credit: Associated Press  By of the  Madison— Scott Walker's former presidential campaign still owes more than $1 million, despite raising $500,000 in the last three months of 2015.  Also Friday, the Republican governor said he's dropping the practice his political operations adopted last year of paying for the travel costs to campaign events for Walker's state security team. Taxpayers will now, as they did before the presidential campaign, foot the costs of both the travel and salaries of the governor's security when he leaves the state for political events.  As of the end of last year, Walker's White House campaign had about $1.2 million in obligations left and about $153,000 in cash that partially offsets those debts.  Though Walker has raised nearly $8 million for his short run, his operation spent the cash faster than he could raise it over the campaign's 71-day life, and he dropped out of the 2016 presidential race in September.  A report filed Friday with federal elections officials shows the resulting burden won't be an easy one, even for the best political fundraiser in state history.  Governor Walker made substantial progress in addressing financial commitments over the last quarter, and he remains humbled by the outpouring of support from friends across the country who continue to believe in his common sense reform agenda, spokesman Joe Fadness said.  The filings show Walker still owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to a number of companies, including fundraising and communications consultants, direct mail companies, and photographers and video producers.  His highest debts include: $317,000 to FLS Connect LLC, a Minnesota-based telemarketing company; $82,000 to a Washington, D.C.-based legal consulting company, Jones Day; $70,000 to SCM Associates, a New Hampshire based direct mail printing company; $59,000 to the Lukens Co., an Arlington-based direct mail printing company; $44,000 in event staging expenses to MMA Events, a Maryland-based company; and $39,000 to an Alexandria-based video production company, Sharp Politics.  Walker also got some help from his state campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker, which purchased $14,682 of items from the presidential campaign.  And he rented his voter list to Voter Gravity Inc., and Granite Lists LLC, for $20,000 and $15,700.70, respectively.  The governor did make some progress paying off his debts in the wake of his failed presidential bid.  He had owed about $10,500 to the Waukesha County Expo Center, where he officially launched his 2016 campaign in July, but paid that bill in full.  Walker also refunded 152 contributions for a total of $407,546.24.  Walker's presidential campaign took in $2.4 million and $1.2 million during July and August. Those figures dropped off dramatically in September, with $484,521, and October, with $35,279. The campaign still managed to break six figures in individual contributions in November and December, bringing in $127,498 and $151,334, respectively.  Also Friday, Walker's affiliated Unintimidated PAC reported that it took in $3.7 million in itemized receipts in the last half of 2015. The grand majority of that money came from two families: Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein contributed $2.5 million; and Mary and Mike Shannon of Milwaukee contributed another $500,000. Richard Uihlein is CEO of Pleasant Prairie-based Uline Corp. Mike Shannon is the CEO of KSL Capital Partners.  The PAC filed termination papers Friday.  State officials also said Friday that in the future, Walker's political operations will no longer reimburse state taxpayers for his security team's travel expenses.  Walker's political operations have reimbursed state taxpayers $260,000 to cover hotel stays, airfare and other travel expenses last year for his security team. But in the future, taxpayers will have to pay such costs when state troopers accompany Walker on political trips, said Jim Dick, a spokesman for the state Department of Administration.  Walker decided last year to have his political operations pick up some of those costs while he crisscrossed the country and traveled overseas as he explored and launched his presidential campaign.  But Walker is returning to the previous practice as used by other governors of both parties. Democrat Jim Doyle, for instance, brought security along on his travels to political and other events, such as a December 2010 visit to Cancun for a United Nation climate change conference.  The Wisconsin governor was an early favorite in the Republican field after surging in the wake of a January 2015 speech in Iowa, but then began to flounder as real estate mogul Donald Trump surged and Walker had to clarify statements about birthright citizenship and building a wall on Canada's border.

58b61315,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.  How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.  The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” Emphasis mine throughout. Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”  This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci pictured at right has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine HCQ will not only treat a current case of coronavirus “therapeutic” but prevent future cases “prophylactic”. So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 ?M completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”  Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.  He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”  The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.  But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.  Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.  On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.  “Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”  Said Dr. Zelenko:  If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.  All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.  The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.  While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”  So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.  This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934.  Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem.  So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over.  Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic.  It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?  There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word.  Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world.",Fauci knew about HCQ in 2005 -- nobody needed to die,FALSE
b5bf9ed6,"Update 1040ET: Science moves fast during an outbreak like this, and Dr. Feigl-Ding has issued a few tweets clarifying and correcting some of the information cited in the threads we included below.  Though beforehand, he acknowledged that the paper' conclusions are bat shit wild and need to be scrutinized by the scientific community immediately.  https://t.co/wHJIcXZ4PA 23. Apparently I’m not alone thinking this paper’s conclusion is “bat-shit” wild pardon the pun. We need to replicate this study now before the world goes mad. Let’s all pause and hold our breath please ??. https://t.co/Vrjcn9FCm7 January 31, 2020  The situation is fluid. Who knows what researchers will discover next?  * * *  Over the past few days, the mainstream press has vigorously pushed back against a theory about the origins of the coronavirus that has now infected as many as 70,000+ people in Wuhan alone depending on whom you believe. The theory is that China obtained the coronavirus via a Canadian research program, and started molding it into a bioweapon at the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. Politifact pointed the finger at Zero Hedge, in particular, though the story was widely shared across independent-leaning media.  The theory is that the virus, which was developed by infectious disease experts may have originated in the Wuhan-based lab of Dr. Peng Zhou , China's preeminent researcher of bat immune systems, specifically in how their immune systems adapt to the presence of viruses like coronavirus and other destructive viruses. Somehow, the virus escaped from the lab, and the Hunan fish market where the virus supposedly originated is merely a ruse.  Now, a respected epidemiologist who recently caught flack for claiming in a twitter threat that the virus appeared to be much more contagious than initially believed is pointing out irregularities in the virus's genome that suggests it might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon, and not just any weapon but the deadliest one of all.  and instead appear to be closer to HIV. The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications. In  Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag , Indian researchers are baffled by segments of the virus's RNA that have no relation to other coronaviruses like SARS,  For those pressed for time, here are the key findings from the paper, which first focuses on the unique nature of 2019-nCoV, and then observe four amino acid sequences in the Wuhan Coronavirus which are homologous to amino acid sequences in HIV1:  Our phylogentic tree of full-length coronaviruses suggests that 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS CoV [Fig1]. In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1. On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the spike glycoprotein amino acid sequences of all available coronaviruses n=55 [refer Table S.File1] in NCBI refseq ncbi.nlm.nih.gov this includes one sequence of 2019-nCoV[Fig.S1]. We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses Zhou et al., 2020. We then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 HIV-1 proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1. The first 3 inserts insert 1,2 and 3 aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 6 amino acid residues and insert 2 6 amino acid residues in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 12 amino acid residues in 2019- nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 8 amino acid residues maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.  Why do the authors think the virus may be man-made? Because when looking at the above insertions which are not present in any of the closest coronavirus families, it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time. Instead, they can be found in cell identification and membrane binding proteins located in the HIV genome.  Since the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- “GTNGTKR” IS1, “HKNNKS” IS2, “GDSSSG” IS3 and “QTNSPRRA” IS4 Figure 2. To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family Supplementary figure. This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time. The insertions were observed to be present in all the genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV virus available from the recent clinical isolates. To know the source of these insertions in 2019-nCoV a local alignment was done with BLASTp using these insertions as query with all virus genome. Unexpectedly, all the insertions got aligned with Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 HIV-1. Further analysis revealed that aligned sequences of HIV-1 with 2019-nCoV were derived from surface glycoprotein gp120 amino acid sequence positions: 404-409, 462-467, 136-150 and from Gag protein 366-384 amino acid Table 1. Gag protein of HIV is involved in host membrane binding, packaging of the virus and for the formation of virus-like particles. Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4.This binding induces structural rearrangements in GP120, creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine co-receptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5.  And some visuals, which lead the paper authors to conclude that this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect:  3D modelling of the protein structure displayed that these insertions are present at the binding site of 2019-nCoV. Due to the presence of gp120 motifs in 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein at its binding domain, we propose that these motif insertions could have provided an enhanced affinity towards host cell receptors. Further, this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect. To the best of our knowledge, the function of these motifs is still not clear in HIV and need to be explored. The exchange of genetic material among the viruses is well known and such critical exchange highlights the risk and the need to investigate the relations between seemingly unrelated virus families.  A good recap of the findings was provided by Dr. Feigl-Ding, who started his explanatory thread by pointing out that the transmission rate outside China has surpassed the rate inside China.  But the 'smoking gun' in this case are pieces of the virus's genetic code that Indian researchers, led by Prashant Pradhan at the Indian Institute of Technology, found may have been 'embedded' from HIV, which belongs to an entirely different family of viruses.  pic.twitter.com/WeVA948xin 16.

a14a969b,"DREAM Act applications roll in while Excelsior Scholarship applications are suspended by One Party Rule in New York  ALBANY, NY – The New York State Senate Republican Conference today slammed Democrats who have kept applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants open while closing the Excelsior Scholarship application available to citizen students, whose families are struggling even more due to forced business closures during the coronavirus pandemic.  “Time and time again, Democrats show New Yorkers their true priorities and under One Party Rule, illegal immigrants come before hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers. When Senate Democrats voted to create free tuition for illegal immigrants, Republicans said no. To add insult to injury, so many families are facing an even more dire financial hardship after Governor Cuomo forced their livelihoods shut. To close citizen students out of the application process while continuing to give illegal immigrants free tuition is ludicrous. New Yorkers shouldn’t be funding tuition for illegal immigrants at all, and we should be closing down that program permanently as we look to find savings in our budget,” said Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt.  Tuition for SUNY schools is due in August, leaving parents nervous as they check the still closed application page.  “Middle class, law-abiding, taxpaying parents are struggling right now. They and their children deserve answers. New York State should not be playing politics with their futures,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “If anyone ever needed a crystal clear example of the Senate Democrat’s ‘Bizzaro World’ priorities that put illegal immigrants first and hardworking, law-abiding taxpayers dead last, look no further than this latest shameful policy. In January 2019, Senate Democrats rammed through their so-called ‘DREAM Act’ giving free college to illegal immigrants. I voted no and said their DREAM Act was a nightmare for taxpayers to the tune of $27 million annually. Now in July 2020, Senate Democrats show they’ve learned nothing as they’re shamefully keeping open applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants while closing Excelsior Scholarship applications to citizen students, many of whom have families that are financially reeling due to the Coronavirus outbreak. This latest policy hypocrisy shows that the Senate Democrats continue catering to their illegal immigrant base while law-abiding taxpayers get another slap in the face,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “There may be disagreement as to whether those who are here illegally should be getting the benefits of legal citizens, but there should be no disagreement that state government should not be discriminating against citizen students and their families who are part of the Excelsior Program and who are anxiously waiting for their tuition relief applications to be processed. Every legislator took an oath of office to represent the interests of the legal citizens of this state and nation and they will have to answer to those voters in November if they fail to uphold that oath,” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “We have law-abiding, hardworking families across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions struggling to make ends meet, paying outrageously high state and local taxes, and going into huge amounts of debt trying to afford college for their children. It’s not right to ignore the needs and the hopes of these families while we turn around and continue to deliver hard-earned taxpayer dollars to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrant families,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “The thousands of New York students who have been shut out of this application process with no explanation from the state deserve immediate answers. Countless New Yorkers are facing unprecedented economic hardship as a result of state actions and now the state is just adding insult to injury by leaving them in this limbo. It is absolutely unacceptable and the state needs to get its priorities in order,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “Only in NYC-Democrat-ruled New York would you send law-abiding, taxpaying families to the back of the line while giving illegal immigrants preferential treatment when it comes to college tuition aid. Every parent and student who was counting on the Excelsior Scholarship for the fall semester and is now desperately worrying about how to pay the August bill deserves an explanation as to why they’ve been put on hold while applications and aid are flowing for illegal immigrants seeking a free college education at taxpayer expense. It’s outrageous, unfair, and it symbolizes everything that’s wrong in Albany under One Party Rule,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Many New Yorkers have suffered and continue to experience significant challenges as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While I believe access to a quality education is important, we should not be prioritizing one segment of the state’s population, especially during this difficult time. Our focus must be on providing assistance to the state’s hardworking residents, families, business owners, and taxpayers who are struggling,” said Senator Joe Griffo.  “Senate Democrats have been clear about their priorities since day one – those that break the rules come first and those that follow the rules take a back seat. Senate Republicans have always stood with law-abiding citizens and this case is no exception,” said Senator Rich Funke.  “It is unconscionable that Democrats would punish students whose only crime is that they are citizens. It is no wonder that hard-working New York families are leaving the state in droves,” said Senator Andrew Lanza.  ###",NY Senate Republican Conference Slams Democrats For Giving Illegal Immigrants Free Tuition While Halting Applications For Struggling Citizen Students During Pandemic,partially false
673f05fa,"Manchin and Capito Introduce Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung  Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin D-WV and Shelley Moore Capito R-WV introduced legislation to boost participation in federal programs that detect and treat black lung disease among coal miners.  “Coal miners sacrifice a lot, including their own health, to keep our lights on, heat our homes, and power our businesses. Black lung cases are at a 25-year high and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable. Our amendment will make sure more miners participate in early detection so we can catch it and treat it quicker. The health and safety of our miners should always be our number one priority and I will be fighting for this amendment to be included in the final spending bill,” Senator Manchin said.  “West Virginia coal miners have worked tirelessly for decades to keep industries and communities in this country moving,” Senator Capito said. “These resources dedicated to the early detection of black lung could be life-saving for thousands of hardworking West Virginians. Amazing work is being done in this area by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Respiratory Health Division in Morgantown, and I am honored to help that work continue and provide assistance to those who have given so much to our state.”  According to a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health, cases of black lung are at a 25-year high in Appalachian coal mining states, with as many as one in five underground coal miners in the region having evidence of black lung. In order to address this worsening public health crisis, Senators Manchin and Capito have filed an amendment to the defense, labor, health and education spending package currently under consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate aiming to improve the participation rate of coal miners in federal health surveillance programs that detect and treat black lung. Specifically, the amendment requires the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to submit a report to Congress on ways to boost outreach efforts to increase participation in the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program CWHSP and to identify barriers that deter miners with black lung from accessing treatment. CWHSP is a national program that offers free health screening services to coal miners, including chest X-rays, lung function testing, respiratory health assessment questionnaires, and extended health surveillance. However, the current national participation rate in CWHSP is approximately 35 percent among active miners and even lower among retirees.  ###",Manchin and Capito Introduce Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung,TRUE

So we are seeing overall crime throughout the country is going down but not here in Missouri,” said Evans.  Last week marked the official launch of Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to combat violent crime in the region. The same week, St. Louis elected officials passed the Cure Violence plan.  To Evans, Parson stepping in “takes political courage” and puts much-needed boots on the ground.  “Freeing up some more police officers, because you don’t go in and rob a bank when there is a cop car outside,” Evans said.  Dueker noted the police officers “are grateful for any sort of help.”  But, that is just one step to addressing the issue, she said.  “I think you have to do a multifaceted approach, and I’m not exactly seeing that yet. The bottom line is the most dangerous people have to be taken off the streets,” Dueker said. “You have to have a short-term solution, a medium-term solution, and a long-term solution. The short-term solution has to be to get the most dangerous people off the streets.

684c9ba4,"Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno is an American hero. Two weeks ago, Michigan 13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin A Elsenheimer agreed to allow Mr. DePerno’s client, William Bailey, and a highly skilled team of IT experts to perform a forensic examination on 16 of the Dominion voting machines in Antrim County. On Monday, Judge Elsenheimer agreed to allow the results of the forensic examination to be released to the public. The results were damning.  THE REPORT:  After the forensic examination of 16 Dominion Voting machines in Antrim, Co., MI, Allied Security Operations Group has concluded that the Dominion Voting machines were assigned a 68.05% error rate. DePerno explained that when ballots are put through the machine, a whopping 68.05% error rate means that 68.05% of the ballots are sent for bulk adjudication, which means they collect the ballots in a folder. “The ballots are sent somewhere where people in another location can change the vote,” DePerno explained. The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots or .0008%.  Based on the Allied Security Operations report, Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno states: “we conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan. We further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.  The stunning report was widely criticized by the Democrat Party mainstream media and by the dishonest Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.  TRENDING: Our Motherf*ckin Streets! Antifa Terrorists March Through NYC in Riot Gear - Media Silent VIDEO  Following the bombshell findings by Mr. DePerno and his team of IT experts, a “risk-limited audit” was ordered by Sec. of State Benson. Constitutional Attorney Matt DePerno was invited to observe the “risk-limiting audit” of Antrim County’s vote that took place yesterday in the Kearney Twp. hall in Bellaire, MI., where 6 officials from the Secretary of State continuously walked around the room observing and correcting the counters who dared to stray from their objectives.  According to Verified Voting: The risk-limiting audit process can be conducted on any set of paper ballots that has a record of the number of ballots cast, how they are stored, and how to retrieve any particular ballot ballot manifest. For an RLA to meaningfully support confidence in the reported election outcome, the standard is higher, and requires the following:  Paper ballots preferably marked by hand and supplemented with a ballot marking device for those who need to use one.  A deliberate and intentional step for a voter to check the paper ballot for accuracy before casting the ballot voter verification.  Rigorous ballot accounting and a properly maintained chain of custody of the ballots.  If photographic evidence proves seals on the Dominion voting machines were broken on November 27, how can a “properly maintained chain of custody of ballots” be assured. The answer is, it can’t.  Before her so-called audit was completed, Sec of State Benson explained the purpose of the “risk limited audit” to the media while ensuring the integrity of the elections in Michigan:  “While we know the machine tabulators functioned properly in Antrim, we are conducting this audit to assure the public of what countless officials from both parties at the federal, state and local levels have already confirmed – that this was the most secure election in our nation’s history and the certified results are an accurate reflection of the will of the voters,” adding, “It is time for Michigan, and the nation to once and for all dismiss the meritless disinformation campaign that seeks to undermine the integrity of our election and move forward in support of our collective democracy.”  Mr. DePerno, who acted as an observer to the “risk-limited audit,” doesn’t agree with Ms. Benson about the integrity of Michigan’s election and has provided us with video and photographic evidence to prove that he was again able to debunk her statement about the “most secure election in our nation’s history.”  The first video provided by Matthew DePerno shows a bin of ballots from Mancelona Township, Precinct #1. The bin was delivered to three of the 20 bi-partisan volunteers that included several Antrim Co. city clerks who agreed to assist with the “risk-limited audit.”  Inside the bin, tabulated ballots were mixed in with ballots that were never tabulated, and several blank ballots were mixed in as well. Mr. DePerno referred to the bin of ballots as “an absolute mess!” On December 16, we reported about photographs taken at Mancelona Township’s Precinct #1 on November 27, 2020, that showed both of the security seals on the Dominion Voting machine were missing.  The second video was taken at a table where ballots were being counted in Helena Twp. The volunteers can be seen questioning why there were fewer ballots in the bin than the original number that was recorded in the previous recount? Shortly after asking the question, a male SOS official approached the table with a bag marked “spoiled ballots” and told them to count them. ATtorney Matt DePerno witnessed the unidentified male SOS rep pulling the “spoiled ballot bag out of the bin and delivering it to the volunteers who were “auditing” the ballots. DePerno also witnessed the SOS official telling them to add the “spoiled ballots” to the count.  The third video was taken at a table where the ballots from Central Lake Twp. were being counted. In the video, a male counter can be seen questioning “multiple ballots with the same signature.” According to Matthew DePerno, 138 ballots had write-in-votes where the penmanship was exactly the same.  In the video below, the SOS official can be seen demanding that the counters ignore what they believe is voter fraud and count the ballots.  “We need to do the counts because if we don’t have the counts, then we can’t move forward. And we understand that there is a concern with this precinct—but this is not a time for you to be investigating right now.”  “Did you find something else?” the male counter asks.  “No,” she replies, adding, “So, you need to move forward with the audit, so we can get the numbers, so we can see how many ballots are here.”  The female counter asks, “So when we’re done with the audit, there’s still the opportunity to challenge the fact that we have multiple ballots with the very same signature?” she asks.  “I don’t know if ‘challenge’ is the right word,” the SOS official says.  “But we’re challenging—” the volunteer says.  The male volunteer tells the SOS, “We’ll go ahead and count the ballots moving forward, but we will separate out, and count those— there’s going to be an asterisk, saying ‘these ballots have the same signature.'”  “And again, we know that you have a concern with this precinct,” she tells them, explaining, “That’s not your role at this very moment,” as she continues to push for them to ignore the multiple matching signatures and only count the ballots.  “What I need you to do right now is finish the audit,” she tells them again. Both of the volunteers explain that they are going to make a note of the ballots, to which the SOS official replies, “Again, that is not the process.”  The SOS official implores them to continue to count the presidential ballots.  At no point does the SOS official assure them that the issue of the multiple potentially fraudulent ballots will be addressed, but instead demands that they count them as if they were all legitimate ballots.  In this video, the SOS official can be seen telling the volunteers who are objecting to adding the ballots in question to the vote total, “This is not an investigation right now!”  On December 16, one day after Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos testified in front of the MI Senate Oversight Committee, Mr. DePerno contacted us to say Poulos was incorrect in his statement that the ballots were securely stored. In fact, Mr. Derno provided us with photos showing seals were broken on one of the tabulators. DePerno explained, “In Central Lake, the lock that protects the side data port where you can insert a thumb drive in order to perform a software upgrade, that could change the program, was missing.” He explains, “The missing lock gives the ability of any person, including a voter to change the Dominion Voting machine program.”  Mr. DePerno explained to us that once the seals are broken, and the lock is removed, the integrity of the machines has been compromised. “It definitely showed that someone had accessed the inside of the tabulator, and it no longer represents a secure voting platform,” DePerno said.  The bin or box seen in the image below is where the ballots are stored. DePerno explained, “If you remove the tape, it gives you the ability to separate the tabulator from the box that contains the ballots.”  The photo below shows the stack of ballots in Central Lake that were cast for Joe Biden. The ballots that are pulled forward are all ballots that the counters pulled forward after objecting to the legitimacy of the ballots.  Mr. DePerno was stunned by the number of blank ballots that were mixed in with actual ballots, saying that he believes he observed more blank ballots in the recount than there are registered voters in Antrim County.  DePerno told us, “The guidelines from RLA were not followed. What they did yesterday was not an audit under those guidelines. It was a hand recount of the presidential race only and failed to address many of the problems with down-ballot races. Members of the public who assisted in the hand recount were not allowed to ask any questions or question any ballots. This hand recount also failed to address any of the glaring problems from the erroneous counts conducted on November 3 and November 6. Yesterday was nothing more than political theatre designed to allow the Secretary of State to again publish the same false narrative to the Michigan voters. Yesterday, when the people conducting the count dared ask questions, they were shut down.”  DePerno’s forensic and photographic evidence should be enough to call the entire Michigan election into question.

2f4df790,"There was joy in the air Tuesday, as State Republican Chair Ed Cox and Erie County Republican Chair Nick Langworthy reflected on what they called a great election year for the GOP and an opportunity to change politics - in New York and nationally under President-Elect Donald Trump.  WBFO's Mike Desmond reports  Both chairmen pointed to Trump being a New Yorker who is familiar with Upstate from his travels while considering a run for governor.  Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford and we found that to be substantial, Langworthy said. He carried towns that haven't gone Republican in years and years in a presidential election. Towns like West Seneca and Hamburg and he won Cheektowaga, a critical town. That means, frankly, that there is cross-over Democratic appeal for his candidacy.  They lost because they did not have a candidate who was a leader, who could have a vision for this country, who addressed the real problems of this country, particularly in the swing states, which were contested and which she lost 48-46, those swing states where there was a real contest going on, Cox said. Donald Trump won because he is a leader and he had a vision for America.  They also pointed to Congressman Chris Collins, his key role in the presidential campaign and his continuing role defending decisions made by the president-elect.  Locally, they also pointed to the way Democratic regions in Erie County turned out to vote Republican this year, a sign of potential future change. Cox also pointed to the election of Chris Jacobs as essential to continuing Republican control of the State Senate.    Holding on to a majority in the State Senate because of Chris Jacobs' win here in Erie County is also historic because, of course, we lost that majority in 2008, Cox said. We lost it again in 2012. In this presidential year, we held on to our majority in the State Senate because of Chris Jacobs' win here.  Cox said it is even more important because a Republican seat on Long Island has possibly flipped to the Democrats. The state chairman said that vote followed the indictment of the Senate candidate's father on corruption charges, something he calls political in bringing the charges close to the election.","NYS, local GOP enjoying victory tour",FALSE
186685b0,"Natural News Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab.  But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remnant of the virus on U.S. soil.  You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted:  In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit.  That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered.  The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.  The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain.  How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vector  One of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus.  Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”  The following map outlines the complete gene sequence of the pShuttle tool:  The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses.”  The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses:  A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification.  The paper describes how this approach will, “expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses.”  During this process, of course, the pShuttle leaves behind unique code, a “fingerprint” of the genetic modification. It is this fingerprint that has now been identified in the coronavirus.  As revealed by genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler in this bombshell analysis article, the pShuttle genetic code is found in the coronavirus that’s circulating in the wild.  This is proof that the virus has been engineered by human scientists.  “IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” writes Lyons-Weiler for IPAK:  Another gene sequence also shows a 92% match with the Spike protein from the SARS coronavirus:  The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.  The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler:  The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.  He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.”  He concludes:  If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.  Brighteon.com/a4d2afed-56c6-4602-b6ab-6f777ba4a69a  Another doctor from Beijing Medical University warns the virus appears to be genetically engineered  Lyons-Weiler is not alone in his assessment of the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus. Dr. Yuhong Dong, who holds a doctorate degree in infectious diseases from Beijing University, writes in The Epoch Times:  Based on recently published scientific papers, this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation. The virus presents with severe clinical features, thus it poses a huge threat to humans. It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.    Dr. Yuhong reminds us that a Jan. 30 science paper published in The Lancet concludes that, “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus.” In other words, this did not occur through natural mutations in the wild.  He also points to a Jan. 27th study by five Greek scientists who also concluded the coronavirus has no lineage to other viruses in the “family tree” that’s found in the wild. He writes:  A Jan. 27 2020, study by 5 Greek scientists analyzed the genetic relationships of 2019-nCoV and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus. All this indicates that 2019-nCoV is a brand-new type of coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that 2019-nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.  “No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market”  Dr. Yuhong writes about The Lancet study by authors Roujian Lu et al., from the China Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, repeating a quote from that paper:  First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals including mammals were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV.  In other words, it isn’t from bats.  That means the entire mainstream media is lying to us about the real origins of the coronavirus.  That same paper goes on to underscore the misinformation in the official explanation, stating, “Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere.”  Both Lu in The Lancet paper linked above and Lyons-Weiler point to the presence of a SARS binding protein sequence in the coronavirus that allows it to easily infect human cells. As explained in The Epoch Times:  …despite considerable genetics distance between the Wuhan CoV and the human-infecting SARS-CoV, and the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the receptor binding RBD domain with a high homology to that of SARS-CoV. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for cross species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. So to our surprise, despite replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues, the Wuhan CoV S-protein was found to have a significant binding affinity to human ACE2. …The Wuhan CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV S-protein shared an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface. Thus the Wuhan CoV is still able to pose a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S protein–ACE2 binding pathway. emphasis added    As Dr. Yuhong asks, “How could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor? How did the virus change just four amino acids of the S-protein? Did the virus know how to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats CRISPR to make sure this would happen?”  It couldn’t happen by chance, in other words. The coronavirus is not a random mutation in the wild. It was engineered.  Many other scientists around the world are now investigating the gene sequences found in the coronavirus, and they are increasingly concluding that elements of the virus have been engineered.  Many of those scientists are being threatened and censored. One paper has so far been forced to be withdrawn and revised, no doubt to remove the key conclusions that point to the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus, but the proof of its engineering cannot be denied forever.  Brighteon.com/0bddc3da-f590-445e-ac38-9a74e358a57c  Either the coronavirus was genetically engineered, or the science establishment is going to have to throw out the entire field of genomics research and claim it isn’t real  Eventually, the science establishment is either going to have to conclude that this coronavirus strain was engineered, or that all the laws of genetics science don’t work, and gene sequencing is imaginary sort of like transgenderism by the “progressive” Left, which has already abandoned biological reality.  So far they’ve tried to bamboozle the public into believing this is all some sort of accident from Mother Nature, but that has only worked because most of the public doesn’t understand enough science to counter the official propaganda. However, there are more than enough independent scientists around the world to prove that this pandemic strain was engineered by humans. More evidence is coming out each day.  Interestingly, as this article is going to press, all the official numbers of infections and deaths from coronavirus have been frozen for about 14 hours and counting, almost as if every nation of the world has agreed to stop reporting new numbers. This may be a temporary situation that gets resolved in the next few hours, but it’s highly suspicious. For the last week, we’ve been getting new updates about every 12 hours or sooner, and we’ve never seen the count frozen for this long.  At the same time, an 11th case of coronavirus has now been confirmed by the CDC in the United States, revealing that infections are continuing to spread in the USA, despite the efforts of the CDC to contain the outbreak.

610801c6,"Natural News Shocking new survey data shows that a growing number of parents are waking up to the vaccine industry’s lies — at least when it comes to flu shots. While vaccine skepticism is largely maligned by the mainstream media, the truth is that a substantial number of professionals are turning their backs on Big Pharma. Anti-vax nurses are coming out of the woodwork to tell their stories, and many top scientists are now refusing to vaccinate their own children.  It is no wonder that a growing number of Americans are realizing Big Pharma and the government elite do not have the public’s best interests in mind. And as polling data from Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children shows, many Americans are now realizing just that.  Flu shot skepticism on the rise  The mainstream medical community has been working tirelessly with the establishment media and the pharmaceutical industry to push the narrative that all vaccines are safe and that the flu shot is necessary for “good” health. But despite their best efforts, national polling data shows that nearly half of American parents believe the flu shot can make their kids sick.  As researchers from Orlando Health report, a growing number of people are questioning the safety and efficacy of flu vaccines. Some 50 percent believe the flu shot may make their child sick, and another third of parents believed the flu shot simply didn’t work.  Twenty-eight percent of parents also stated that the flu shot might be a cause of autism.  Dr. Jean Moorjani, a pediatrician at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, was quick to refute any and all vaccine skepticism in a recently published press release on the study’s findings. “After years of research, we know that the flu vaccine is safe,” said Dr. Moorjani.  Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary sulforaphane and glucosinolate nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.  “The flu shot does not cause autism or any other diseases or illnesses. Doctors recommend the flu shot because it is the best way to protect you and your family from the flu.”  In December 2018, a grown man was hospitalized after a routine flu vaccination left him completely paralyzed and unable to breathe independently. He was ultimately diagnosed with Guillian-Barre Syndrome, a known side effect of vaccination. It’s an autoimmune condition characterized by the immune system’s destruction of nerves, resulting in weakness or paralysis.  There are thousands of vaccine-related adverse events reported every year following vaccination, and estimates suggest that only 10 percent of vaccine reactions actually get reported.  The flu shot fraud  Despite strict adherence to the pro-vaccine narrative, the truth about vaccines can’t be ignored forever. As the polling data shows, people have questions — and they aren’t going to be satisfied with platitudes. There is no shortage of propagandists chastising the public for daring to question the validity of industry-funded vaccine science. The take-home message from vaccine propagandists is simple: Don’t question our authority, don’t question the authority of the unelected bureaucrats who run government health agencies, and certainly don’t question the “health experts” who create and push vaccines on the public.  You aren’t allowed to because you aren’t an “expert” — and only people who support the pro-vaccine agenda are allowed to be called “experts.” Gatekeeping is major problem in science today, whether you’re talking about vaccines, pesticides, climate change or GMOs. Whether it’s realized or not, corporate influence has overtaken the scientific community across the board.  If average people are too stupid to be allowed to question vaccine science, they certainly aren’t capable of consciously consenting to vaccination. Big Pharma and their puppets can’t have it both ways.  See more coverage of the latest vaccine truth at Vaccines.news.

fb721890,"Natural News The oldest magazine in the United States, Scientific American, has issued a strong warning about the dangers of 5G technology. Their concerns about both the known and the potential dangers of 5G carry a lot of weight because the magazine is so influential and known for its rigorous scientific standards. In print since 1845, Scientific American is widely considered by modern fact checkers to be pro-science and highly credible.  Public health researcher Joel M. Moskowitz of the University of California, Berkeley, says in the article that 5G is a lot more harmful than the government and telecommunications industry want people to believe. He also said the same is true of Wi-Fi and cellular technology.  Exposure limits are outdated  One of his biggest concerns is related to the fact that the FCC is reaffirming exposure limits for radio frequency radiation, or RFR, that were put in place in the 1990s long before Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G existed. In other words, the FCC plans to maintain significantly outdated safety standards that do not take into account the increasing pile of evidence showing that it is harmful in many ways.  According to Moskowitz, the exposure limits set in the ‘90s were mostly related to the potential effects of RFR exposure intensity. Now, however, we know that there is a risk of cancer and other problems.  5G will introduce the use of millimeter waves, in addition to the microwaves that older cellular technologies used. Moreover, the limited reach of 5G means cell antennas will need to be placed every 100 to 200 meters, increasing people’s exposure. On top of that, new technologies in 5G such as beam-forming antennas, massive MIMO, and phased arrays, will make it difficult to measure exposure.  Short-term exposure to millimeter waves, which are absorbed by human skin and the surface layer of the cornea, can affect the nervous, cardiovascular and immune systems. Long-term exposure could put people at risk of melanoma, ocular melanoma and sterility.  Moskowitz argues that new exposure limits should be put in place that account for certain effects of signals, such as polarization and pulsing, that raise their health and biologic impacts. The current RFR exposure limits set by the FCC regulate the intensity of the exposure but ignore the RFR’s signaling properties.  Moskowitz also referred to the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which outlines how EMF impacts living beings at levels that are significantly below most guidelines. These effects include cellular stress, rises in harmful free radicals, reproductive system changes, neurological disorders, learning and memory defects and a greater cancer risk. Effects are also being noticed in plant and animal life.  The scientists who signed the appeal represent the majority of scientific experts on non-ionizing radiation, who have published more than 2,000 papers and letters on the topic of EMF in professional journals among them.  Moskowitz also takes issue with the fact that many working in the telecommunications industry and the government officials who they’ve brought over to their side label those who point out 5G’s dangers as fear mongerers. This is far from a conspiracy theory; this position is coming from a body of legitimate scientific research.  He said: “Since much of our research is publicly-funded, we believe it is our ethical responsibility to inform the public about what the peer-reviewed scientific literature tells us about the health risks from wireless radiation.”  In short, 5G can be likened to a “global human experiment without consent.” The very fact that Scientific American’s editorial board chose to print a piece that is so strongly against 5G shows that even the world’s most mainstream scientific publications have serious reservations about this technology – and that should be enough to make anyone question whether this technology should be used at all.

3bc38092,"An email Hunter Biden received in April 2015 from a Burisma executive discussing an introduction to then-Vice President Joe Biden, which lies at the heart of a New York Post investigation, is unquestionably authentic, a cybersecurity expert told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Thursday.  The DCNF obtained a full copy of Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday. The DCNF provided Robert Graham, the founder of the cybersecurity firm Errata Security, with a copy of the email and its metadata for forensic analysis.  Graham, who has been cited as a cybersecurity expert in The Washington Post, the Associated Press, Wired, Engadget and other news and technology outlets, told the DCNF that he used a cryptographic signature found in the email’s metadata to validate that an account used by Vadym Pozharsky, an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors, emailed Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015.  In the email, Pozharsky thanked Hunter Biden for “inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.”  The New York Post first reported the email in October, describing it as a “smoking-gun” showing that Hunter Biden had introduced his father to the Burisma executive in 2015.  The email was sent less than a year before Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a prosecutor who was reportedly investigating the gas company in return for a $1 billion loan guarantee.  Graham previously told the DCNF that emails sent from Gmail, such as Pozharski’s message to Hunter Biden, can be “absolutely verified beyond a shadow of a doubt” by testing its contents against the unique DKIM signature found in its metadata.  Graham used the DKIM signature within the email to verify with a private key on Google’s servers that the sender, recipient, subject, date and body of the message that the DCNF obtained from Giuliani were unchanged from when the email was originally sent in April 2015. RELATED: Hunter Biden Emails Could Be ‘Absolutely Verified’ If Rudy Giuliani Released The Metadata, Expert Says  Graham said the only way the email could have been faked is if someone hacked into Google’s servers, found the private key and used it to reverse engineer the email’s DKIM signature.  Email metadata on its own does not provide any indication of whether hacking had anything to with the email’s release, Graham noted.  “Of course, committing criminal hacking doesn’t make true information any less true, so no matter how illegitimately they gathered emails, the contents are provably legitimate,” Graham said.  Joe Biden’s presidential campaign said in a statement that his schedule indicates that no such meeting as alleged in the email took place. However, the campaign later told Politico that they could not rule out the possibility he had a cursory encounter with the Burisma executive.  The email came from a computer that Hunter Biden reportedly dropped off at a Delaware-based computer repair shop in April 2019. The repair shop owner provided Giuliani a copy of the hard drive after it went unclaimed.  Hunter Biden has not denied giving his laptop to the Delaware repair shop. RELATED: Hunter Biden Isn’t Denying He Gave His Laptop To A Delaware Repair Shop  Giuliani had initially refused to provide the Daily Caller with a copy of the hard drive in mid-October, saying that questions surrounding the veracity of its contents were “pettifogging nonsense” pushed by the “liberal press.”  The Biden campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.

465eaa43,"By Ellen Boxall  MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell is fast becoming known as the nation’s kookiest conspiracy theorist. His latest theory takes the cake.  In a post on social media dumpster fire Parler, Lindell produced a new spin on the real reason behind the Capitol attack.  “The rioters were hypnotized by antifa temptresses who hid psychoactive drugs in their vaginas,” said Lindell. “If you look at the video, many of the rioters had crazed looks in their eyes.”  Several Trump supporters are still clinging to the ridiculous fantasy that antifa was behind the attack, not Trump supporters.  Lindell is a notorious conspiracy theorist who seems to leave a trail of wreckage in his wake. Last week, a Newsmax reporter walked off the set after Lindell started ranting about fixed voting machines.  “On Tuesday, Bob Sellers tried to get a steaming Lindell back on cue: ‘We wanted to talk to you about canceling culture, if you will. We don’t want to re-litigate the allegations that you’re making, Mike.’ But Lindell wouldn’t stop talking about fraud,” said The Washington Post. “The Newsmax anchor finally asked his producers to end the segment. ‘Can we get out of here, please?’ he asked. Then the anchor simply got up and walked off the set.”  However, Lindell’s profligate lying may have finally caught up with him. He’s been banned from Twitter and his products are being kicked out of stores. Now, he’s being sued by Dominion Voting Systems.  “Despite your repeated promises—not to mention your considerable and costly efforts to bankroll a so-called investigation into Dominion—you have failed to identify a scintilla of credible evidence that even suggests that Dominion is somehow involved in a global conspiracy to harvest millions of votes in favor of President-elect Biden,” said a letter from Dominion’s attorneys. “Of course, this is because no such evidence exists. But that is of no consequence to you because you are resolutely uninterested in acknowledging the truth about these issues.”  Smartmatic, another company that makes voting software, has sued FOX News for $2.7 billion for spreading false stories about its role in election fraud.",Lindell: Capitol Rioters Were Drugged By Antifa Sluts,FALSE

37699224,"Mary Burke, the Democrat running for governor, on Thursday stumbled when explaining her definition of plagiarism. The issue has come to the forefront in her race against Republican Gov. Scott Walker after it came to light her jobs plan contained passages that had appeared in other candidates’ plans.  By of the  Madison — Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke stumbled Thursday when asked to define plagiarism and said she had not violated her principles with a jobs plan that includes nearly word-for-word sections that also appear in other candidates' plans.  Burke, who is running against GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 4 election, also stressed the importance of providing citations in her plan, but an aide said later no changes to the plan would be made.  Asked by reporters to define plagiarism, Burke said: This, this probably, using words, exact words, from a source that doesn't, that isn't cited and isn't attributable.  She said she her jobs plan did not violate her principles.  When you put together economic development plans, this is about bringing in the best ideas, she said. And this is not anything more than bringing good ideas to Wisconsin, to the plans on how I'm going to move Wisconsin forward. And in describing some of these ideas, similar language was used by the consultant that was used in those ideas that he incorporated in other candidates' plans.  Last week, it surfaced that Burke's jobs plan included nearly identical passages from ones by three other Democrats — Delaware Gov. Jack Markell in 2008, Ward Cammack of Tennessee in 2009 and John Gregg of Indiana in 2012.  When the matter became public, Burke said the sections came from consultant Eric Schnurer of the Pennsylvania firm Public Works and he was no longer doing work for the campaign.  Those exact words should not have been used, that were used in other plans, and that's why we cut ties, she said Thursday. But I'll be clear about this: As governor, I'm going to welcome ideas from other places, the best ideas and best practices.  She has not modified the wording of her jobs plan, but said it was important to provide citations in her plan.  Certainly, anything that is not directly from Eric that should be cited would be cited, she said.  But afterward, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said the plan already included all needed citations.  Where cites are appropriate, they have been made, Zepecki said in an email. In other instances work product that has been identified as coming from Mr. Schnurer has been addressed by cutting ties with him.  BuzzFeed, the website that first reported last week on the wording of Burke's jobs plan, cited three more instances Wednesday of borrowed language. The latest examples represent a further step down in substance and significance from the previous cases of verbatim and nearly verbatim copying.  Asked after a Madison meeting whether he thought the revelations about Burke were a potential turning point in the campaign, Walker said he thought they were.  Yeah, I think that the problem for her is this isn't just some campaign flier...This was the centerpiece of her campaign, Walker said. I do think the legitimate question goes to the heart to the authenticity of the candidate.  Burke spoke to reporters Thursday at an event where she received the endorsement of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the state's largest police union.  In endorsing her, the union's executive director, Jim Palmer, blamed Walker for a rise in violent crime, citing FBI statistics.  Under Scott Walker, not only has Wisconsin trailed its neighbors in creating jobs, but in combating violent crime as well. The crime data shows that Wisconsin has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office, Palmer said. And we can no longer afford his brand of failed leadership.  Also Thursday, Walker received the endorsement of the Wisconsin Troopers Association.  It is clear that public and highway safety is a top priority of this administration, the group's executive director, Ryan Zukowski, said in a statement.  Meanwhile Thursday, the Republican Governors Association announced that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will campaign on Monday for Walker in Hudson. That's the same day First Lady Michelle Obama is in Milwaukee for Burke.  Christie is the chairman of the Republican Governors Association and, like Walker, a potential candidate for president in 2016.

629bd28a,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - After narrowly winning an Aug. 7 special election for a Columbus-area congressional seat, newly minted GOP Rep. Troy Balderson of Zanesville is badly losing the fundraising battle in his November rematch with Democratic Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor, Federal Election Commission filings show.  Reports that covered the pair's campaign fundraising from July 19 through Aug. 27 showed O'Connor had more than $1 million in the bank at the end of August, compared with under $93,000 for Balderson.  O'Connor took in almost $4 million during the period covered by the report, including more than $1.4 million he got after losing the election by 1,680 votes. Balderson raised slightly more than $500,000. Roughly $180,000 of the cash Balderson raised came from political action committees.  O'Connor's campaign said he got donations from more than 92,000 people in the period covered by the report, most of whom gave small amounts of money. Most donors listed in his report were from outside of Ohio.  We have thousands of people chipping in $5 and $10 at a time, said O'Connor's campaign manager Annie  Ellison  . They are excited about Danny's campaign for new leadership. And we are really proud of that.  Balderson's campaign had a different take on O'Connor's haul.  Liberal out of state special interest groups are continuing to prop up Danny O'Connor's campaign in their efforts to retake the House and put Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker's chair, said a statement Balderson released through his campaign before his own report was filed. While O'Connor's campaign has raised 90% of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters, our campaign is funded by hard-working Ohioans who want someone who will fight for them and their middle class values.  O'Connor's campaign got more than $114,000 from political action committees, including $5,000 each from organizations associated with autoworkers, boilermakers and firefighters unions. He also got a $5,000 donation from a committee associated with New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and $2,000 from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign committee.  The political committees that contributed to Balderson included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which gave $2,000, and political committees associated with aspiring House of Representatives speakers Kevin McCarthy of California, who gave $4,000, and Jim Jordan of Champaign County, who gave $2,000. Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's political committee gave $5,000 to Balderson, as did political action committees for Koch Industries, Murray Energy, and Cardinal Health.  O'Connor's campaign said Balderson's report demonstrated he's beholden to corporations and party bosses.  We're proud of the grassroots support behind Danny's campaign for new leadership because people are ready for someone who isn't beholden to any corporation or party boss, that's why he didn't take a single dime of corporate PAC money and 92% of contributions were for $50 or less, Ellison said. Central Ohioans get excited for new leadership when they hear from Danny, and with this grassroots army we'll have the resources to communicate his message.  O'Connor's biggest expenses were more than $2.6.million spent on media production and buys, and digital services. He felt financially secure enough to give a $25,000 contribution to the Ohio Democratic Party on Aug. 10.  Balderson's campaign spent more than $400,000 on media buys and more than $42,000 on fundraising services. He also paid the Republican National Committee $25,000 for a campaign event.  Records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that outside groups spent more than $5 million so far to back Balderson and oppose O'Connor, while groups sympathetic to O'Connor have spent around $1.3 million.  My record of balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and delivering results are what Ohioans are looking for in a Congressman, as evidenced by my victory in the August special election, said a statement from Balderson. We will have the necessary resources to deliver that message and defend against any attacks from the O'Connor-Pelosi team.",Danny O'Connor has more than 10 times Troy Balderson's money going into November rematch,partially false
31a6122b,"Republicans are slamming Joe Biden after the presumptive Democratic nominee made a verbal gaffe during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania and said 120 million people had died from the novel coronavirus.  “People don’t have a job, people don’t know where to go, they don’t know what to do,” Biden said Thursday. “Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.”  As of Thursday, there have been more than 122,000 – not million -- coronavirus deaths in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins figures.  While Biden appears to immediately catch himself after his gaffe -- the pool video of Biden’s comments cuts off after he made the remark – Republicans were quick to jump on the former vice president’s comment.  “WHAT IS GOING ON WITH JOE BIDEN?” Steve Guest, the Republican National Committee’s rapid response director, tweeted out with a link to the clip.  President Trump’s reelection campaign team went after Biden even harder – calling him “very confused” and dredging up one of Biden’s past gaffes when he said that 150 million Americans had died from gun violence since 2007.  “Joe Biden is very confused,” the campaign tweeted out. “He's not playing with a full deck, folks. #BarelyThereBiden.”  Biden was in Lancaster, Pa., to discuss unveil his healthcare proposals as his campaign revs up for more appearances after months indoors amid the coronavirus pandemic. His campaign has focused on small group gatherings to mitigate chances of spreading COVID-19 instead of large public rallies like Trump has begun to hold again.  NEW POLLS INDICATE TRUMP TRAILING BIDEN IN 6 KEY BATTLEGROUNDS  During his stop, Biden pushed the need to protect Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, while also taking shots at Trump’s recent comments on testing. Trump told a crowd at a rally over the weekend that he asked staff to slow down coronavirus testing.  “He called testing, quote, a double edge sword,” Biden said. “Let's be crystal clear about what he means by that. Testing unequivocally saves lives and widespread testing is the key to opening our economy. That's one edge of the sword. The other edge, he thinks that finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad.”  Biden added: “Donald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks to start caring about what America has happened to the rest of America.”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Biden’s verbal slip-ups have plagued him throughout his 2020 presidential bid with the Trump campaign using them as fodder to argue that the presumptive Democratic nominee is unfit for the Oval Office, as well as to draw attention away from Trump’s own mistakes.  The president himself has been hammered by pundits and Democrats for false or misleading claims he’s made regarding the coronavirus pandemic – from his now infamous March 6 declaration that anybody that wants a test can get a test to claiming that the Obama administration had left him with bad or old tests for COVID-19 even though there could not have been a test until Trump's presidency.  Despite Biden’s slip-ups on the stump, his poll numbers against Trump continue to rise with a Real Clear Politics average showing the former vice president holding a 10 point lead over the current White House occupant with the general election less than five months away.",Biden slammed after wrongly saying ‘we have over 120 million dead from COVID’,FALSE

An IP address owned by Kaspersky Lab – Moscow hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the data analysis. Kaspersky is a Russian software and cybersecurity firm. Kasperky Lab was co-founded by Eugene Kaspersky and his now-ex-wife, Natalya Kaspersky.  Eugene Kasperky, the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, served in the Soviet military intelligence service and is a graduate of The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School, now known as Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, part of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, widely known as the FSB.  Natalya Kaspersky is now the CEO of Russia’s InfoWatch Group and has a reported net worth of $270 million. “Natalya Kaspersky’s Snoop-Proof Phone Helps Putin Thwart Spies,” according to Bloomberg.  President Trump banned Kaspersky from all U.S. government networks when he signed the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act NDAA. “The ban, included as part of a broader defense policy spending bill that Trump signed, reinforces a directive issued by the Trump administration in September that civilian agencies remove Kaspersky Lab software within 90 days,” Reuters reported on December 12, 2017. “The law applies to both civilian and military networks.” U.S. District Court Judge for the U.S. District of the District of Columbia Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, former Presiding Judge of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court FISA Court, upheld President Trump’s ban after Kaspersky Labs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  “Christopher Krebs, a senior cyber security official at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters that nearly all government agencies had fully removed Kaspersky products from their networks in compliance with the September order,” according to the Reuters report. President Trump “terminated” Krebs in mid-November 2020 after Krebs claimed the 2020 election was the most secure election in history.

e5e34f96,"Nation  Feds Seize 19,888 Fake State Driver Licenses Made in China in Chicago O'Hare Airport - ALL Registered to Vote -- ALL Democrat  Why are the Chinese making so many fake U.S. driver licenses? Why are they being shipped to Chicago's O'Hare Airport? Why are ALL the names completely phony; yet ALL are Registered to Vote . . . and Registered as Democrats?  That’s a disturbing little tidbit to discover, especially right before an election, right?  According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the bulk of these fake U.S. IDs flooding into the country come from China and Hong Kong, with the rest coming in from South Korea and the U.K.  Officials in Chicago just confiscated a shipment of these fake IDs totaling nearly 20 thousand.  Of course, the local news media in Chicago doesn’t see a connection to “voter fraud,” but most other people do.  As a matter of fact, it’s the main thing that most people see with just three months before an election.  What emboldens illegal voters more than to head to the polls with a phony ID in their pocket in case anyone asks for ID?  From Fox Five Federal customs officers have seized 1,513 shipments from overseas containing fraudulent documents—19,888 counterfeit U.S. driver’s licenses—just at Chicago O’Hare International Airport this year through the end of June. Most of the shipments came from Hong Kong and mainland China, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Other shipments came from South Korea and the U.K. “These counterfeit driver’s licenses can lead to disastrous consequences,” CBP’s Ralph Piccirilli said in a statement. “Criminal organizations use these counterfeit IDs to avoid attracting attention to their illegal activities.” […] “What is most disconcerting about these interceptions, besides the volume in which we are experiencing, is the ease in which so many young people freely share their personal information with counterfeiters abroad,” Lemaux said in a statement. “We’ll continue to collaborate with local law enforcement to educate the public, and anyone who is contemplating purchasing a counterfeit ID online, on the potential dangers of sharing your personal, identifiable information with a criminal element.”  These, they caught.    Makes you wonder how many slipped through the cracks?  Oh, and how is it that that ALL of these phony names are ALL registered to vote and ALL registered as Democrats?  HAL TURNER COMMENTARY  I think that we need to really think outside of the box and be open to *anything* in terms of cheating or interference, because the Dems simply can’t lose this election, and they’ll work with anyone, anywhere to help squeak out a victory.  And I think China is the number one culprit we need to keep our eyes on.  This is literally China Collusion with the Democrats.

1abdbb0e,"Every patient visiting their family doctor or attending a hospital appointment in England will be asked to declare if they are gay, straight or bisexual under controversial new rules imposed by the NHS.  The astonishing diktat – condemned last night as ‘intrusive’ and ‘insulting’ – orders doctors to include details of a patient’s sexuality on their permanent medical record for the first time.  An official NHS directive, seen by The Mail on Sunday, reveals that from April 2019 all patients aged 16 or over will face questioning about their sexual identity.  NHS England last night refused to give details about how the highly personal information will be collected – leading to fears patients could be quizzed by GPs, nurses and even receptionists.  Scroll down for video  Every patient visiting their family doctor or attending a hospital appointment in England will be asked to declare if they are gay, straight or bisexual under controversial new rules file photo  Its instructions, published last week, say that ‘sexual orientation monitoring’ should take place ‘at every face-to-face contact with the patient, where no record of this data exists’.  The directions suggest patients could be asked the highly personal question regularly if the records are not properly shared between different parts of the NHS as patients attend GP appointments, A&E, outpatients or even antenatal classes.  There are also fears about the security of the data, as any leak could potentially ‘out’ thousands of patients.  Health chiefs say NHS organisations and councils must ask so that they can obtain better data on the health of gay and bisexual people throughout England.  Failing to do so risks breaking the Equality Act 2010, gay rights groups have warned.  But last night politicians and doctors said the NHS had ‘no place’ asking all patients the question.  Former Labour Minister Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, said: ‘Unless it’s related to your health, your sexuality is not the NHS’s business.’  And Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It sounds intrusive and Orwellian.’  Never before has the State insisted citizens face a question about their sexual identity. The Office for National Statistics considered including it in the 2011 census but decided against due to ‘concerns about the quality and accuracy of data... and issues of acceptability to respondents’.  The astonishing diktat – condemned as ‘intrusive’ and ‘insulting’ – orders doctors to include details of a patient’s sexuality on their permanent medical record for the first time file photo  People over 16 will be asked: ‘Which of the following best describes how you think of yourself?’ They can say they are ‘straight’, ‘gay or lesbian’, ‘bisexual’ or ‘other’.  They will also be able to state that they are ‘not sure’ of their sexuality, or ‘decline to provide a response’. But whatever answer they give – including if they refuse to divulge their sexuality – will be noted on their medical record for ever.  Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said: ‘I think it’s a confounded cheek to ask GPs to do this. It really is not the place of family doctors, to start monitoring people’s sexuality.  ‘We are at risk of becoming state apparatchiks, asking questions about patients’ sexuality, housing, whether they can cook, or do crochet! When someone comes in for their precious eight minutes with me, I’m interested in what they want from the consultation.  ‘It isn’t relevant to ask an 87-year-old grandmother if she has ever had a relationship with another woman. She would find that incredibly insulting and storm out. It would ruin the consultation.’  The project is being launched – without full public consultation –after at least seven years’ lobbying by the LGBT Foundation.  NHS England said the Manchester-based gay rights charity had ‘led the work to develop’ the so-called ‘sexual orientation monitoring information standard’ – the framework under which ‘all patients/service users aged 16 and over across all health services and local authorities’ will be quizzed about their sexuality.  The document, bearing the logos of both organisations, says there is ‘strong evidence’ that lesbian, gay and bisexual [LGB] people are ‘disproportionately affected’ by sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, poor mental health and loneliness in old age.  More data would enable NHS and social care bosses to ‘better understand, respond to and improve LGB patients’ service access, outcomes and experience’ and allow ‘targeted prevention and early intervention’ work to improve their health.  The Equality Act 2010 contains a legal obligation for all public sector bodies to pay ‘due regard’ to the needs of lesbian, gay and bisexual people’ to ensure they are not discriminated against.  Collecting and analysing data on sexual orientation would be ‘evidence of compliance’ for health and social care providers, the document adds.  Dr Ian Banks, former president of the Men’s Health Forum, said in an ‘ideal world’ it would be good to have ‘big data’ about patients’ sexuality to improve health services. But he warned: ‘Some people don’t want others to know their sexuality. It’s up to them – it’s not up to NHS England to know, or the GP to ask.’  Many justifiably feared that a data breach, or request from an insurance company, could mean details of their sexuality being made public.  In March, the Information Commissioner announced it was investigating fears that medical records held by 2,700 GP practices – a third of those in England – were not secure and could be read by workers including clerical staff. Changes have since been made.  ‘People don’t believe that their notes are going to stay confidential,’ Dr Banks said. ‘Once it’s down on our medical notes, that’s it – you can’t get rid of it. And then it goes out to numerous databases.’  Those who refused to state their sexuality could face uncomfortable questions about why, he added.  In a statement, NHS England said: ‘All health bodies and local authorities with responsibility for adult social care are required under the Equality Act to ensure that no patient is discriminated against.  ‘This information standard is designed to help NHS bodies be compliant with the law by consistently collecting, only where relevant, personal details of patients such as race, sex and sexual orientation. They do not have to do it in every area, people do not have to answer the questions and it will have no impact on the care they receive.’",Doctors are ordered to ask patients if they are gay,partially false

Three potential vaccines are currently in Stage 3 trials in the United States and could be ready in weeks, President Donald Trump said Tuesday.  Time is running out. And Trump has the military lined up and ready to distribute this vaccine to the public, whether you want it or not. The plan is to distribute the vaccine first to health care and other vital workers, as well as those most vulnerable likely the older populations. After production ramps up, it will be made available to all Americans who want it. If you decide you don’t want it, don’t worry, the military will help convince you.  The Department of Defense and federal health agencies have outlined plans for a coronavirus vaccine, which includes having them available for free for all Americans. We have warned that the DoD is about to become the enemy of the public. Instead of committing terrorism abroad, they will be going that here. Prepare yourself.  The Pentagon & CDC Will Join Together To Mass Distribute The COVID Vaccine  This toxic concoction will also be “free.” The government says they will foot the bill borrow money from the Federal Reserve to get everyone vaccinated, according to the Watauga Democrat.  “Preparing for the implementation of the safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine programs is a critical next step in the efforts to protect Americans and reduce the impact of COVID-19 and restore our normal way of life,” Centers for Disease Control and Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Wednesday, according to CNN.  The plans came in the form of a report to Congress and a “playbook” for states and local governments, according to the Associated Press and Fox News. The agencies are looking at January for a potential beginning of a vaccination campaign, although it remains possible that this could come later this year.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s playbook, the vaccination campaign will be “much larger in scope and complexity than seasonal influenza or other previous outbreak-related vaccination responses.”  President Trump said in a “Fox & Friends” interview Tuesday that a vaccine could be approved “in a matter of weeks.”  Time is almost up. Once this vaccine gets into your bloodstream, you cannot take it back out. This one is different from every other vaccine made, and it’s going to be necessary if you want to get groceries or leave your house. Mandatory or not, they will do what they can to convince you to take this vaccine.  Stay alert and be prepared.

acd85167,"Nancy Pelosi has stooped to a new low. This time, attacking a 100-year-old monument devoted to the 10 commandments that has been in the lobby of the capitol building for nearly a century.  Work crews showed up and made quick work, rolling the monument out and down the ramp for disabled people.  Pelosi had this to say about the removal:  “It’s long overdue that we make a separation between church and state. Non-Christians should not be forced to read the 10 commandments while walking into their capitol. God doesn’t belong here.”  God doesn’t belong here? Those are fighting words.  More than ever, it’s clear that God is needed in our government. Our lawmakers need to be reminded of who is actually in charge. We should have biblical laws on the books. Husbands should be able to sell their wives to settle debts. Women should be silent. Lethal force should only be permitted after darkness. And, if a woman interferes in a fight between two men by grabbing her husband’s opponent’s privates, her hand should be cut off.  We need to get back to these biblical basics. Removing an ancient monument should be the furthest thing from Pelosi’s agenda.  But, of course, it’s not.  Joe Barron, the representative for the organization, Put God Everywhere says:  “We will fight this every step of the way. The first step was to get in front of the monument as they were rolling it out and try to stop it. Unfortunately, it was just too heavy to stop. We will continue this tug-o-war for months and have no doubt we will be victorious. The monument WILL be placed back in the Capitol when we are finished!”  As God would want it. We are sure.",Pelosi Has 100-Year-Old Ten Commandments Monument Removed from Capitol,FALSE

Writing for TheHill, analytical columnist John Solomon, uncovers that payouts were made by lawyer Lisa Bloom to ladies who were willing to lie and act in public that they were sexually attacked by now President Donald Trump. The cash was attractive, so they decided to do it.  As indicated by the report, one of the accusers had the mortgage on her home paid off, while the other was offered cash amount of $750,000.  The names of two of were uncovered by the NY Times and both are attached to the evilness. Guess who? George Soros and Hillary Clinton.  Right after that, it was uncovered that Soros invested an astounding $3 million into the New York Times by taking up a lot of the organization’s stocks.  Could this action be a method for controlling the publication’s account on such stories on in the near future? Well of course!

bc6d5d55,"Under a Treaty signed in late 2019 with Canada, the People's Liberation Army of China has been quietly massing military troops in Canada since the beginning of 2020 and those troops are believed to be readying for an actual military invasion of the United States.  While it has long been rumored that China began massing troops and armor in southern Mexico for a similar invasion goal, word of such troops appearing in Canada only began this year. Those rumors were pretty much laughed off until video emerged this week of Chinese troops on a back road of Salt Spring Island, near Vancouver, British Columbia.  Here is that 35 second video:  Once actual proof emerged of Chinese troops in Canada, we started digging into where they were in relation to US soil and how such a thing could be; given that Canada was _supposed_ to be a U.S. ally?   The map below shows where China is massing the troops in Prince Rupert and on Salt Spring Island, BC, CANADA:  It turns out that the globalist/Commie Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, signed a Treaty with China in late 2019.  In January, 2020, the Canadian Independent Press Review reported it as follows:  Under the terms of the Foreign Investment Protection Act FIPA, a bi-lateral treaty ratified with China by the Trudeau government in 2019, Chinese security forces can be stationed on Canadian soil to protect vital Chinese investments, without the knowledge or consent of local authorities.                    – Canadian Independent Press Review, January 15, 2020  One has to ask why Prime Minister Trudeau would sign such a treaty?  Does Canada not have its own military to protect vital Chinese investments?   Does Canada not trust its own Royal Canadian Mounted Police?  Are Canada's Provincial Police forces somehow inadequate?  Or did Prime Minister Trudeau somehow find that allowing China to mass troops in his country might be beneficial to HIMSELF?  Did Trudeau get a massive payoff from China to betray the United States like this?  What other explanation could there be?  According to locals in British Columbia, PLA troops are troops being stationed in Stanley Park almost an entire island of a park in Vancouver, as temporary housing until they are assigned something permanent.  Look at the size of this park:  Oh, and get this . . .Canadians say THEY CANNOT GO INTO THAT PARK because it is taken over by China's People's Liberation Army!   Anyone trying to enter the park is stopped by Vancouver police and refused entry unless they are PLA troops!  One Canadian tells me “You got ‘em PLA Troops all over the coast, man, based outta Prince Rupert. A bunch of their military intel people work outta their consulate in town Vancouver and they can airlift the assault troops here in an hour, is what I been told.”  That same source went on to say That’s how that fucking traitor Trudeau’s arranged it with Beijing, man. The west coast is theirs. They’re gonna be the ones managing the curfews and all the other shit that’s gonna follow.   So, ladies and gentlemen, our neighbor and ally, Canada, under the completely fraudulent guise of protecting Chinese investments, has betrayed the United States and is permitting China to mass troops on Canada's west coast, and China is doing so - allegedly to protect their investments - but in actual fact, for use in attacking and conquering the United States.     REDEPLOYMENT OF F-22's AND F-35's to . . .  Alaska  There was a curious story a few weeks ago about how the US is redeploying F-22's and F-35's to . . . Alaska. Story Here   It didn't make any sense at the time.  Why would we put some of our most advanced fighter jets all the way up there?   Now, we seem to know!   The US Government knows what China is doing and our government is preparing to fight them off!  Those planes can fly in from behind the Chinese troops and bomb them.     CALL-UP of ONE MILLION RESERVISTS  There was another story back in March, by ABC News HERE about President Trump authorizing the Secretary of Defense to Call-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists.  At the time, we were told that the call-up had to do with COVID-19 and those troops would be able to help with the outbreak.     That story just didn't hold water because the COVID outbreak wasn't nearly that bad.  Now, the call-up seems to make sense.  The US Government saw that China has begun massing troops and is calling-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists to fight them off!     West Coast Wild Fires to chase population away?  For months, the US west coast has been seeing ferocious wildfires that have burned millions of acres, and destroyed tens-of-thousands of homes.  Just two weeks ago, earthquake guru Dutch Since accidentally stumbled upon what appear to be Directed Energy Weapons being used to start and spread those fires!  His video showed that US Satellites in space which monitor environmental conditions in the USA, picked up literal beams in the Near-infra-red spectrum, being fired at and into the wildfires.   Here's a screen shot of such beams being fired:  When those beams hit, the fires immediately grew in intensity, and spread.  Other photos - VERY MANY - have been taken by citizens on the scenes as these beams were fired and they were so shocked at seeing it, the people too photos of the beams as they took place:  Here's a slew of others: Click image to enlarge  Then, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, revealed to the American people that China and Russia have weaponized space and he specifically mentioned Directed Energy Weapons in his address to an Air Force conference.  In just the first TWO MINUTES, the Secretary of Defense repeatedly tells us that China and Russia are employing Asymmetric capabilities and he flatly states they have weaponized space with Directed Energy Weapons.  Just watch the first two minutes:  I'm sure all of you at some time or another have seen a car fire.   They get to burning pretty ferociously, right?  When have you EVER seen a car fire that causes the wheels to actually melt?  Take a look at what's been happening in the US west coast . . .  Vehicles are being MELTED in the so-called wild fires.  How can burning wood melt steel?  It can't.  The burn temperature doesn't get hot enough.   But a directed energy weapon could do it . . . and now, it looks as though that's precisely what's been happening!  But why?  Why would China want to start massive fires on our west coast?  Simple: To chase the people out.  The world knows that American citizens are ARMED to the teeth thanks to our Constitution's Second Amendment.  Famously, back in World War 2 after their attack upon Pearl Harbor, a Japanese General remarked that Americans were so heavily armed that Japan would face a gun behind every blade of grass if they ever tried to invade.  That, he said, was why Japan never invaded.  China knows this too.  So they're burning us out!   They're starting these fires to get rid of literally millions of Americans so Chinese troops WON'T face a gun behind every blade of grass.   These fires are softening-up the west coast for invasion!     UPDATE 10:12 PM EDT --  HEADS UP! DURING THIS MORNINGS INTERVIEW WITH MARIA BARTIROMO, PRESDENT TRUMP SAID... I HAVE BEEN BRINGING ALL OUR TROOPS HOME, WE NEED TO HAVE OUR TROOPS HOME FOR RUSSIA AND CHINA.     Why isn't Congress doing anything to defend us?  Where is a Declaration of war?   We've been under attack by directed energy weapons for months. It's time to attack back.  Americans are URGED to arm themselves and prepare.  Invading foreign army persons are to be shown NO QUARTER and NO MERCY.  Take no prisoners.   This is going to be a fight for our very existence.      SURVEIL THEM!  Canadians in British Columbia are encouraged to engage in ACTIVE, OPEN, DELIBERATE, SURVEILLANCE of Chinese Troops.  Take photos.  Take videos.  Go to Stanley Park and fly drones over it to grab video.  Go to Salt Spring Island and do the same.  Remember, there is no expectation of privacy for anything which is out in public.  No law exists preventing the surveillance of foreign military troops in public.  Either publish your videos to Youtube or to Brighteon where they won't get censored and send them to me at: Hal.Turner@HalTurnerRadioShow.com.  These troops need to be tracked and monitored.  Their locations must be determined and kept under watchful eye.  If military EQUIPMENT such as Tanks, Armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery, helicopters, or planes of any type are found, grab images and video of those too.

31d33510,"Though the whole world relies on RT-PCR to “diagnose” Sars-Cov-2 infection, the science is clear: they are not fit for purpose  Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter  Lockdowns and hygienic measures around the world are based on numbers of cases and mortality rates created by the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests used to identify “positive” patients, whereby “positive” is usually equated with “infected.”  But looking closely at the facts, the conclusion is that these PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2.  Unfounded “Test, test, test,…” mantra  At the media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:  We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.”  The message was spread through headlines around the world, for instance by Reuters and the BBC.  Still on the 3 of May, the moderator of the heute journal — one of the most important news magazines on German television— was passing the mantra of the corona dogma on to his audience with the admonishing words:  Test, test, test—that is the credo at the moment, and it is the only way to really understand how much the coronavirus is spreading.”  This indicates that the belief in the validity of the PCR tests is so strong that it equals a religion that tolerates virtually no contradiction.  But it is well known that religions are about faith and not about scientific facts. And as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.”  So to start, it is very remarkable that Kary Mullis himself, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR technology, did not think alike. His invention got him the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1993.  Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year at the age of 74, but there is no doubt that the biochemist regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection.  The reason is that the intended use of the PCR was, and still is, to apply it as a manufacturing technique, being able to replicate DNA sequences millions and billions of times, and not as a diagnostic tool to detect viruses.  How declaring virus pandemics based on PCR tests can end in disaster was described by Gina Kolata in her 2007 New York Times article Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn’t.  Lack of a valid gold standard  Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the PCR tests used to identify so-called COVID-19 patients presumably infected by what is called SARS-CoV-2 do not have a valid gold standard to compare them with.  This is a fundamental point. Tests need to be evaluated to determine their preciseness — strictly speaking their “sensitivity”[1] and “specificity” — by comparison with a “gold standard,” meaning the most accurate method available.  As an example, for a pregnancy test the gold standard would be the pregnancy itself. But as Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, for example, stated in an ABC TV interview in an answer to the question “How accurate is the [COVID-19] testing?”:  If we had a new test for picking up [the bacterium] golden staph in blood, we’ve already got blood cultures, that’s our gold standard we’ve been using for decades, and we could match this new test against that. But for COVID-19 we don’t have a gold standard test.”  Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.  Apart from the fact that it is downright absurd to take the PCR test itself as part of the gold standard to evaluate the PCR test, there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, as even people such as Thomas Löscher, former head of the Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine at the University of Munich and member of the Federal Association of German Internists, conceded to us[2].  And if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis — contrary to Watson’s statement — cannot be suitable for serving as a valid gold standard.  In addition, “experts” such as Watson overlook the fact that only virus isolation, i.e. an unequivocal virus proof, can be the gold standard.  That is why I asked Watson how COVID-19 diagnosis “may be the best available gold standard,” if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, and also whether the virus itself, that is virus isolation, wouldn’t be the best available/possible gold standard. But she hasn’t answered these questions yet – despite multiple requests. And she has not yet responded to our rapid response post on her article in which we address exactly the same points, either, though she wrote us on June 2nd: “I will try to post a reply later this week when I have a chance.”  No proof for the RNA being of viral origin  Now the question is: What is required first for virus isolation/proof? We need to know where the RNA for which the PCR tests are calibrated comes from.  As textbooks e.g., White/Fenner. Medical Virology, 1986, p. 9 as well as leading virus researchers such as Luc Montagnier or Dominic Dwyer state, particle purification — i.e. the separation of an object from everything else that is not that object, as for instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg of radium chloride in 1898 by extracting it from tons of pitchblende — is an essential pre-requisite for proving the existence of a virus, and thus to prove that the RNA from the particle in question comes from a new virus.  The reason for this is that PCR is extremely sensitive, which means it can detect even the smallest pieces of DNA or RNA — but it cannot determine where these particles came from. That has to be determined beforehand.  And because the PCR tests are calibrated for gene sequences in this case RNA sequences because SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a RNA virus, we have to know that these gene snippets are part of the looked-for virus. And to know that, correct isolation and purification of the presumed virus has to be executed.  Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like “No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification” see below.  We asked several study authors “Do your electron micrographs show the purified virus?”, they gave the following responses:  Study 1: Leo L. M. Poon; Malik Peiris. “Emergence of a novel human coronavirus threatening human health” Nature Medicine, March 2020  Replying Author: Malik Peiris  Date: May 12, 2020  Answer: “The image is the virus budding from an infected cell. It is not purified virus.” Study 2: Myung-Guk Han et al. “Identification of Coronavirus Isolated from a Patient in Korea with COVID-19”, Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, February 2020  Replying Author: Myung-Guk Han  Date: May 6, 2020  Answer: “We could not estimate the degree of purification because we do not purify and concentrate the virus cultured in cells.” Study 3: Wan Beom Park et al. “Virus Isolation from the First Patient with SARS-CoV-2 in Korea”, Journal of Korean Medical Science, February 24, 2020  Replying Author: Wan Beom Park  Date: March 19, 2020  Answer: “We did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification.” Study 4: Na Zhu et al., “A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China”, 2019, New England Journal of Medicine, February 20, 2020  Replying Author: Wenjie Tan  Date: March 18, 2020  Answer: “[We show] an image of sedimented virus particles, not purified ones.”  Regarding the mentioned papers it is clear that what is shown in the electron micrographs EMs is the end result of the experiment, meaning there is no other result that they could have made EMs from.  That is to say, if the authors of these studies concede that their published EMs do not show purified particles, then they definitely do not possess purified particles claimed to be viral. In this context, it has to be remarked that some researchers use the term “isolation” in their papers, but the procedures described therein do not represent a proper isolation purification process. Consequently, in this context the term “isolation” is misused.  Thus, the authors of four of the principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery of a new coronavirus concede they had no proof that the origin of the virus genome was viral-like particles or cellular debris, pure or impure, or particles of any kind. In other words, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.  We have also contacted Dr Charles Calisher, who is a seasoned virologist. In 2001, Science published an “impassioned plea…to the younger generation” from several veteran virologists, among them Calisher, saying that:  [modern virus detection methods like] sleek polymerase chain reaction […] tell little or nothing about how a virus multiplies, which animals carry it, [or] how it makes people sick. [It is] like trying to say whether somebody has bad breath by looking at his fingerprint.”[3]  And that’s why we asked Dr Calisher whether he knows one single paper in which SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated and finally really purified. His answer:  I know of no such a publication. I have kept an eye out for one.”[4]  This actually means that one cannot conclude that the RNA gene sequences, which the scientists took from the tissue samples prepared in the mentioned in vitro trials and for which the PCR tests are finally being “calibrated,” belong to a specific virus — in this case SARS-CoV-2.  In addition, there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.  In order to establish a causal connection, one way or the other, i.e. beyond virus isolation and purification, it would have been absolutely necessary to carry out an experiment that satisfies the four Koch’s postulates. But there is no such experiment, as Amory Devereux and Rosemary Frei recently revealed for OffGuardian.  The necessity to fulfill these postulates regarding SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated not least by the fact that attempts have been made to fulfill them. But even researchers claiming they have done it, in reality, did not succeed.  One example is a study published in Nature on May 7. This trial, besides other procedures which render the study invalid, did not meet any of the postulates.  For instance, the alleged “infected” laboratory mice did not show any relevant clinical symptoms clearly attributable to pneumonia, which according to the third postulate should actually occur if a dangerous and potentially deadly virus was really at work there. And the slight bristles and weight loss, which were observed temporarily in the animals are negligible, not only because they could have been caused by the procedure itself, but also because the weight went back to normal again.  Also, no animal died except those they killed to perform the autopsies. And let’s not forget: These experiments should have been done before developing a test, which is not the case.  Revealingly, none of the leading German representatives of the official theory about SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 — the Robert Koch-Institute RKI, Alexander S. Kekulé University of Halle, Hartmut Hengel and Ralf Bartenschlager German Society for Virology, the aforementioned Thomas Löscher, Ulrich Dirnagl Charité Berlin or Georg Bornkamm virologist and professor emeritus at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich — could answer the following question I have sent them:  If the particles that are claimed to be to be SARS-CoV-2 have not been purified, how do you want to be sure that the RNA gene sequences of these particles belong to a specific new virus?  Particularly, if there are studies showing that substances such as antibiotics that are added to the test tubes in the in vitro experiments carried out for virus detection can “stress” the cell culture in a way that new gene sequences are being formed that were not previously detectable — an aspect that Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock already drew attention to in her Nobel Lecture back in 1983.  It should not go unmentioned that we finally got the Charité – the employer of Christian Drosten, Germany’s most influential virologist in respect of COVID-19, advisor to the German government and co-developer of the PCR test which was the first to be “accepted” not validated! by the WHO worldwide – to answer questions on the topic.  But we didn’t get answers until June 18, 2020, after months of non-response. In the end, we achieved it only with the help of Berlin lawyer Viviane Fischer.  Regarding our question “Has the Charité convinced itself that appropriate particle purification was carried out?,” the Charité concedes that they didn’t use purified particles.  And although they claim “virologists at the Charité are sure that they are testing for the virus,” in their paper Corman et al. they state:  RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system Roche, Penzberg, Germany and from cell culture supernatants with the viral RNA mini kit QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany,”  Which means they just assumed the RNA was viral.  Incidentally, the Corman et al. paper, published on January 23, 2020 didn’t even go through a proper peer review process, nor were the procedures outlined therein accompanied by controls — although it is only through these two things that scientific work becomes really solid.  Irrational test results  It is also certain that we cannot know the false positive rate of the PCR tests without widespread testing of people who certainly do not have the virus, proven by a method which is independent of the test having a solid gold standard.  Therefore, it is hardly surprising that there are several papers illustrating irrational test results.  For example, already in February the health authority in China’s Guangdong province reported that people have fully recovered from illness blamed on COVID-19, started to test “negative,” and then tested “positive” again.  A month later, a paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology showed that 29 out of 610 patients at a hospital in Wuhan had 3 to 6 test results that flipped between “negative”, “positive” and “dubious”.  A third example is a study from Singapore in which tests were carried out almost daily on 18 patients and the majority went from “positive” to “negative” back to “positive” at least once, and up to five times in one patient.  Even Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, conceded in February that the PCR tests are “only 30 to 50 per cent accurate”; while Sin Hang Lee from the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory sent a letter to the WHO’s coronavirus response team and to Anthony S. Fauci on March 22, 2020, saying that:  It has been widely reported in the social media that the RT-qPCR [Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR] test kits used to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA in human specimens are generating many false positive results and are not sensitive enough to detect some real positive cases.”  In other words, even if we theoretically assume that these PCR tests can really detect a viral infection, the tests would be practically worthless, and would only cause an unfounded scare among the “positive” people tested.  This becomes also evident considering the positive predictive value PPV.  The PPV indicates the probability that a person with a positive test result is truly “positive” ie. has the supposed virus, and it depends on two factors: the prevalence of the virus in the general population and the specificity of the test, that is the percentage of people without disease in whom the test is correctly “negative” a test with a specificity of 95% incorrectly gives a positive result in 5 out of 100 non-infected people.  With the same specificity, the higher the prevalence, the higher the PPV.  In this context, on June 12 2020, the journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt published an article in which the PPV has been calculated with three different prevalence scenarios.  The results must, of course, be viewed very critically, first because it is not possible to calculate the specificity without a solid gold standard, as outlined, and second because the calculations in the article are based on the specificity determined in the study by Jessica Watson, which is potentially worthless, as also mentioned.  But if you abstract from it, assuming that the underlying specificity of 95% is correct and that we know the prevalence, even the mainstream medical journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt reports that the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests may have “a shockingly low” PPV.  In one of the three scenarios, figuring with an assumed prevalence of 3%, the PPV was only 30 percent, which means that 70 percent of the people tested “positive” are not “positive” at all. Yet “they are prescribed quarantine,” as even the Ärzteblatt notes critically.  In a second scenario of the journal’s article, a prevalence of rate of 20 percent is assumed. In this case they generate a PPV of 78 percent, meaning that 22 percent of the “positive” tests are false “positives.”  That would mean: If we take the around 9 million people who are currently considered “positive” worldwide — supposing that the true “positives” really have a viral infection — we would get almost 2 million false “positives.”  All this fits with the fact that the CDC and the FDA, for instance, concede in their files that the so-called “SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests” are not suitable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.  In the “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel“ file from March 30, 2020, for example, it says:  Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms”  And:  This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.”  And the FDA admits that:  positive results […] do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  Remarkably, in the instruction manuals of PCR tests we can also read that they are not intended as a diagnostic test, as for instance in those by Altona Diagnostics and Creative Diagnostics[5].  To quote another one, in the product announcement of the LightMix Modular Assays produced by TIB Molbiol — which were developed using the Corman et al. protocol — and distributed by Roche we can read:  These assays are not intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of coronavirus infection”  And:  For research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.”  Where is the evidence that the tests can measure the “viral load”?  There is also reason to conclude that the PCR test from Roche and others cannot even detect the targeted genes.  Moreover, in the product descriptions of the RT-qPCR tests for SARS-COV-2 it says they are “qualitative” tests, contrary to the fact that the “q” in “qPCR” stands for “quantitative.” And if these tests are not “quantitative” tests, they don’t show how many viral particles are in the body.  That is crucial because, in order to even begin talking about actual illness in the real world not only in a laboratory, the patient would need to have millions and millions of viral particles actively replicating in their body.  That is to say, the CDC, the WHO, the FDA or the RKI may assert that the tests can measure the so-called “viral load,” i.e. how many viral particles are in the body. “But this has never been proven. That is an enormous scandal,” as the journalist Jon Rappoport points out.  This is not only because the term “viral load” is deception. If you put the question “what is viral load?” at a dinner party, people take it to mean viruses circulating in the bloodstream. They’re surprised to learn it’s actually RNA molecules.  Also, to prove beyond any doubt that the PCR can measure how much a person is “burdened” with a disease-causing virus, the following experiment would have had to be carried out which has not yet happened:  You take, let’s say, a few hundred or even thousand people and remove tissue samples from them. Make sure the people who take the samples do not perform the test.The testers will never know who the patients are and what condition they’re in. The testers run their PCR on the tissue samples. In each case, they say which virus they found and how much of it they found. Then, for example, in patients 29, 86, 199, 272, and 293 they found a great deal of what they claim is a virus. Now we un-blind those patients. They should all be sick, because they have so much virus replicating in their bodies. But are they really sick — or are they fit as a fiddle?  With the help of the aforementioned lawyer Viviane Fischer, I finally got the Charité to also answer the question of whether the test developed by Corman et al. — the so-called “Drosten PCR test” — is a quantitative test.  But the Charité was not willing to answer this question “yes”. Instead, the Charité wrote:  If real-time RT-PCR is involved, to the knowledge of the Charité in most cases these are […] limited to qualitative detection.”  Furthermore, the “Drosten PCR test” uses the unspecific E-gene assay as preliminary assay, while the Institut Pasteur uses the same assay as confirmatory assay.  According to Corman et al., the E-gene assay is likely to detect all Asian viruses, while the other assays in both tests are supposed to be more specific for sequences labelled “SARS-CoV-2”.  Besides the questionable purpose of having either a preliminary or a confirmatory test that is likely to detect all Asian viruses, at the beginning of April the WHO changed the algorithm, recommending that from then on a test can be regarded as “positive” even if just the E-gene assay which is likely to detect all Asian viruses! gives a “positive” result.  This means that a confirmed unspecific test result is officially sold as specific.  That change of algorithm increased the “case” numbers. Tests using the E-gene assay are produced for example by Roche, TIB Molbiol and R-Biopharm.  High Cq values make the test results even more meaningless  Another essential problem is that many PCR tests have a “cycle quantification” Cq value of over 35, and some, including the “Drosten PCR test”, even have a Cq of 45.  The Cq value specifies how many cycles of DNA replication are required to detect a real signal from biological samples.  “Cq values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported,” as it says in the MIQE guidelines.  MIQE stands for “Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments”, a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating publications on Real-Time PCR, also called quantitative PCR, or qPCR.  The inventor himself, Kary Mullis, agreed, when he stated:  If you have to go more than 40 cycles to amplify a single-copy gene, there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.”  The MIQE guidelines have been developed under the aegis of Stephen A. Bustin, Professor of Molecular Medicine, a world-renowned expert on quantitative PCR and author of the book A-Z of Quantitative PCR which has been called “the bible of qPCR.”  In a recent podcast interview Bustin points out that “the use of such arbitrary Cq cut-offs is not ideal, because they may be either too low eliminating valid results or too high increasing false “positive” results.”  And, according to him, a Cq in the 20s to 30s should be aimed at and there is concern regarding the reliability of the results for any Cq over 35.  If the Cq value gets too high, it becomes difficult to distinguish real signal from background, for example due to reactions of primers and fluorescent probes, and hence there is a higher probability of false positives.  Moreover, among other factors that can alter the result, before starting with the actual PCR, in case you are looking for presumed RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the RNA must be converted to complementary DNA cDNA with the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase—hence the “RT” at the beginning of “PCR” or “qPCR.”  But this transformation process is “widely recognized as inefficient and variable,” as Jessica Schwaber from the Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine in Toronto and two research colleagues pointed out in a 2019 paper.  Stephen A. Bustin acknowledges problems with PCR in a comparable way.  For example, he pointed to the problem that in the course of the conversion process RNA to cDNA the amount of DNA obtained with the same RNA base material can vary widely, even by a factor of 10 see above interview.  Considering that the DNA sequences get doubled at every cycle, even a slight variation becomes magnified and can thus alter the result, annihilating the test’s reliable informative value.  So how can it be that those who claim the PCR tests are highly meaningful for so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind out the fundamental inadequacies of these tests—even if they are confronted with questions regarding their validity?  Certainly, the apologists of the novel coronavirus hypothesis should have dealt with these questions before throwing the tests on the market and putting basically the whole world under lockdown, not least because these are questions that come to mind immediately for anyone with even a spark of scientific understanding.  Thus, the thought inevitably emerges that financial and political interests play a decisive role for this ignorance about scientific obligations. NB, the WHO, for example has financial ties with drug companies, as the British Medical Journal showed in 2010.  And experts criticize “that the notorious corruption and conflicts of interest at WHO have continued, even grown“ since then. The CDC as well, to take another big player, is obviously no better off.  Finally, the reasons and possible motives remain speculative, and many involved surely act in good faith; but the science is clear: The numbers generated by these RT-PCR tests do not in the least justify frightening people who have been tested “positive” and imposing lockdown measures that plunge countless people into poverty and despair or even drive them to suicide.  And a “positive” result may have serious consequences for the patients as well, because then all non-viral factors are excluded from the diagnosis and the patients are treated with highly toxic drugs and invasive intubations. Especially for elderly people and patients with pre-existing conditions such a treatment can be fatal, as we have outlined in the article “Fatal Therapie.”  Without doubt eventual excess mortality rates are caused by the therapy and by the lockdown measures, while the “COVID-19” death statistics comprise also patients who died of a variety of diseases, redefined as COVID-19 only because of a “positive” test result whose value could not be more doubtful.  NOTES:- [1] Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of patients with disease in whom the test is positive; and specificity is defined as the proportion of patients without disease in whom the test is negative.

bbf4d6a7,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 2012, on Friday released a copy of his delinquent personal financial disclosure report, a 47-page document showing his wife to be a millionaire with extensive investments held in a family trust.  At a minimum, Ilana Shafran Mandel's holdings are worth $1.95 million. But they could be worth as much as $7.1 million, based on a range of valuations in her husband's financial disclosure report.  Annual income from the trust was at least $860,000 last year and could have been as high as $1.8 million, thanks to dividends, capital gains, rent from real estate and distributions from gas and natural resource partnerships  Mandel's personal financial report was due to the Senate clerk on May 15, little more than a month after he signed candidacy papers on April 5. But he said the complexity and structure of his wife's finances presented questions he needed to resolve in order to file the form correctly. He said the $200 fine he'll have to pay under Senate rules is a fair price for accuracy.  Democrats derided the presumptive GOP Senate nominee for his continued lateness, suggesting he might be hiding something. Keenly aware of the criticism, the Mandel campaign hand-delivered the report to reporters around midday Friday -- yet kept Democrats who wanted to pore over it waiting by choosing to submit it to the Senate via mail. The Senate is likely to receive it early next week.  This frustrated Democratic activists who were waiting for the filing to show up at the Senate clerk's office by the 6 p.m. Friday closing time.  For nearly six months Josh Mandel broke the law and illegally refused to disclose his personal finances despite every other major Senate candidate in the country being in compliance, and now in an effort to continue his evasion tactics, he files a report which is still not yet available to the public on the weekend before the biggest election in the country this year, said Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky.  Based on the copy of the report released to the press, the overwhelming majority of Mandel assets are held for his wife in the JMS Trust -- short for the Joseph M. Shafran Children's Trust. Joseph Shafran is Ilana's father, and his mother -- Ilana's grandmother -- was an immigrant who with her siblings founded a lumber business that grew into Forest City Enterprises. Today, Ilana's trust-held stock in Forest City, a publicly traded company, is worth anywhere from $315,003 to $650,000.  Her other stock holdings through the trust are extensive and include Avon Products, General Electric, J. P. Morgan Chase, McDonalds, Microsoft, Sherwin-Williams and Time Warner. The trust also has an array of bond holdings including Bank of America, the Hamilton County Sewer System, and the Medina County Library. It also is invested in mutual funds, real estate, gas and natural resource partnerships, and a small stake in Wicked People Tour Inc., which Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said is related to the Broadway show Wicked.  Mandel, a Marine veteran who expects to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown next year, is not personally wealthy. He reported his income as state treasurer as $82,477, and his personal investments are worth as little as $60,000 or as much as $375,000, excluding a Lyndhurst condo he and his wife rent out, valued between $100,001 and $250,000.  Brown, who filed his annual disclosure report in May, has a small range of holdings worth as little as $435,010 or as much as $1 million, based on the ranges of values in his report.","Josh Mandel discloses finances, showing his wife with extensive holdings in a trust",TRUE

5fd2bed1,"ABC's Isobel Markham reports:  With the threat of a govenrment shutdown looming, Rep. Tom Graves defended his effort to defund President Obama's signature health care law on This Week Sunday.  We are united around a very simple goal, and that is keeping the government open while protecting our constituents from the harmful effects of Obamacare, Graves said. We have eight days to do that.  The House voted on Friday 230-189 along party lines to pass Graves' bill - his first as a House member - that would extend funding for government operations until mid-December, while defunding the Affordable Care Act, passed into law in 2010. The defunding bill was put forward in the House by Graves, who has taken up the fight led in the Senate by freshman Tea Party Senators Ted Cruz, R-Tex. and Mike Lee, R-Utah to pull the plug on funding for Obamacare.  Friday's continuing resolution now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it will likely be rejected. Tea Party efforts to drum up support in the Senate for defunding Obamacare has yielded lackluster results, with many leading Republicans openly acknowledging the futility of the effort.  On This Week Sunday, House budget committee ranking member Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., dismissed the efforts to defund President Obama's health care law.  There's a reason Republican senators like Senator McCain and others are saying this is absolutely insane, Van Hollen said. They're going to shut down the government if they can't deny health care to millions of Americans.  ABC News  An ABC News/Washington Post poll this week showed that 52 percent are opposed to the law and only 11 percent believe Obamacare will improve their health care. Van Hollen puts this down to confusion surrounding the law, stirred up by Republicans.  I'm not surprised that there's a lot of confusion. These guys have been running around the country demagoguing, scare mongering on this issue, Van Hollen said. They're not afraid that it's going to be unsuccessful, they're afraid it's going to be successful and all of that misinformation will be shown to be a fraud.  Whenever there's a flood these days, you guys in the Republican Party say that's Obamacare, Van Hollen added.  And Van Hollen maintained that support for the health care law was made clear in the 2012 presidential election.  The biggest poll we had on this was the last election, Van Hollen said. President Obama said that she was going to implement the Affordable Care Act and Mitt Romney said he was going to defund it. And the president won on that issue and other issues.  Graves responded that since the election, the Obama administration has made changes to the law, including delaying implementation of certain portions for businesses.  Something very important has happened since the president did win the election and that he himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law, Graves said.  President Obama said Thursday he would veto any government funding bill that didn't include ACA funding. Failure to reach a resolution could result in government shutdown on October 1.

4180cb6a,"Pennsylvania rejects 372,000 mail-in ballots, leaving many voters confused: report  One voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates  By: The Blaze, October 17, 2020:  In the immensely critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, approximately 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. The situation perplexed many voters, but officials say there is an explanation for the confusion.  ProPublica and the Philadelphia Inquirer co-published a report on Friday discovering that 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. Overall, one out of every five requests for mail-in ballots were rejected, according to the report.  However, 90% of those mail-in ballots, about 336,000, were denied as duplicates.  The reason for the confusion is because people may have previously and unknowingly already requested a mail-in ballot for the November election.  Many Pennsylvanians who voted during the June primaries may have checked a box to request a mail-in ballot for the November election. Many may have requested a second ballot unwittingly.  The attempt to promote mail-in voting in June amidst the coronavirus pandemic has caused administrative headaches for election officials preparing for the general election.  “We basically have to treat them all the same,” Bill Turner, acting elections director for Chester County, said. “We’re taking a tremendous amount of staff time and effort only to find out it’s a duplicate.”  “The volume of calls we have been getting has been overwhelming,” Marybeth Kuznik, elections director in Armstrong County, northeast of Pittsburgh, said. “It has been almost like a denial of service attack at times because it seemed that sometimes all I could get done was answer the phone!”  Making matters even worse, nongovernmental election groups have deluged Pennsylvania voters with mail-in ballot applications, urging voters to request mail-in ballots. Some voters assume these applications are from the state. They may think that their request for a mail-in ballot was not received by the government, so they request another mail-in ballot.  A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State said these nongovernmental election groups have caused “confusion for voters and the likelihood that voters will not realize their application has been processed and they don’t need to submit another one.”  “Voters have also been baffled by unclear or inaccurate information on the state’s ballot-tracking website, and by a wave of mail ballot applications from political parties and get-out-the-vote groups,” the report stated. “County offices across the state have been forced to hire temporary staff and work seven days a week to cope with the confusion.”  The report found that there were hundreds of voters who submitted three or more duplicate applications. One voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates.  There are concerns that the confusion over the mail-in ballots could lead to voter disenfranchisement.  Over 2.7 million Pennsylvanians have requested mail-in ballots for this election.  Also this week, nearly 30,000 mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania were sent to the wrong residences. “About 28,879 voters in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, were impacted due to an error made by Midwest Direct, the company tasked with printing, collating and mailing the ballots,” as reported by Fox News.  The inaccurate mailed ballots were a result of a mapping error. Correct ballots began mailing out on Thursday.  Earlier this week, over 100 mail-in ballots were found in a Kentucky dumpster. An investigation was opened by the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General, which led to a U.S. Postal Service employee being terminated.","Pennsylvania rejects 372,000 mail-in ballots, leaving many voters confused: report",FALSE
a19e0df7,"Here’s something your doctor, or Oncologist will never tell you. If you have cancer, then you have fungus/mold/candida. It feeds the cancer, it is cancer itself. Here’s all you need to know and how to deal with it.  Few things are scarier than hearing the words, “you have cancer.” And yet it’s something that an estimated one third, to half the population will hear at least once in their lifetime.  With such staggering rates and so much money and research poured into combating cancer, you would think we would have rounded the corner towards reducing it, or even found a cure by now. What is terrifying is that despite the millions of dollars spent every year on research, we seem to be no closer to knowing exactly what causes cancer, much less finding a cure for it.  But step away from the mainstream noise for a moment and listen to what many health professionals have understood for some time now. As more and more professors and Doctors are making the link between cancer and something else we all suffer from and that’s fungus. We would even go so far as to say cancer is a fungus. They are one and the same.  These findings are covered over  The Data is building. It’s just not been shouted about loudly enough and the voices of the many professionals that have been shouting this from the roof tops have remained more or less unheard. Whilst research papers have been ignored and down played.  For me, cancer often epitomizes the phrase, “etiology unknown.” As the root causes of cancer are never pinned down and gets ignored. Some factors remain to be seen as contributing, such as Genetics, yet in most cases the traits tend to to be more habitual than genetic. And yet, it’s actually less of a mystery than is made out, as by and large, we can see why some people get cancer and others do not.  We can narrow down the contributing factors to one or more of the following: a compromised immune system, poor diet, poor drinking water, smoking, alcoholism, substance abuse, heavy metal toxicity, asbestos poisoning, radiation, or chemicals…. Yet the main factor throughout all cases of cancer is the presence of infestations of fungus in the body.  In fact, it’s not even a new discovery and dates back to Victorian times, yet the fact remains that fungi and their mycotoxins are not as well understood by mainstream medical science as we hoped by now they would be. It’s just not a popular topic and not enough is openly discussed about this hidden killer.  It is unsurprising that any doctor would roll his eyes at the idea of a link between cancer and fungus. Yet did a little and you will discover there are many published papers throughout medical literature describing the very profound role that fungus plays in the development of cancer. So excuse the pun, but fungus has been left in the dark too long.  Let’s shed some light on fungus  Fungi produces chemical by-products as part of its natural life cycle. These chemicals are often toxic, in which case they are known as “mycotoxins”. These mycotoxins are among the most toxic, naturally occurring chemicals on earth. For example, one mycotoxin known as aflatoxin is a carcinogenic mycotoxin known to cause liver cancer. Other mycotoxins are known to be genotoxic and mutagenic and it’s well published that certain mycotoxins cause cancer.  It’s in our food  What people do not realize is that these mycotoxins are known to contaminate parts of our food supply, particularly grain and corn thus must be avoided. Knowing the huge scope those foods play in the global diet and the frequency with which most people consume those foods, the chances are that most people are regularly consuming mycotoxins. Especially the standard American diet of fast and processed foods.  Furthermore, it is published that certain fungi can actually mimic types of cancer in the body!  Certain fungal species produce a sac, or ascomycete, that on close inspection looks just like cancer cells. Just last year in a European medical journal, doctors found conclusive evidence that a breast cancer tumor was actually a sac fungus.  “The likelihood,” they stated,” that the tumor was not fungal in origin, is low.”  Breast cancer is fungus  And this is also what our team found, whilst undertaking a 2 year study in autopsy and that is that ALL breast cancers, when placed under a dark field microscope, are in fact identified as fungus, not cancer, this is where our research really did begin.  So what does this say to you? Surely this should concern us all.  As a cancer patient, you may have received a lot of information about your treatment and your journey to recovery. That Chemotherapy and radiation cause many changes in the body as they destroy the cancer cells.  And of course, one of these major changes is to your immune system. Just as you need it the most. Your now weakened immune system increases your chances of getting an infection, including, of course, any fungal infections. As we have just stated, everyone without exception with cancer has fungus, this is more than just a coincidence.  Some statistics  The numbers are staggering. Some eight million people die every year from cancer worldwide, with more than half a million in the United States alone. The global number is predicted to rise to twelve million by 2030.    Cancer is the biggest cause of death for people under 85 and in the US one in four people die from cancer – one in four. In the UK the government stated that one in every two people alive today will have cancer at some point. These figures are on the increase not decline.  And then when you look at the rise in Fungus levels, in pollution, with poor quality water, phosphate fertilizers in our food, as well as many other environmental issues. It’s no surprise the rate of cancer is set to increase, not decrease.  Sugar fuels fungus  Sugars and wheat products are a great source of fuel to any fungus. Imagine, one grain of sugar gives enough fuel for that fungus to grow quickly and establish itself.  Most people suffer from fungus in their toes and toe nails, an area of the body that can can be seen by the naked eye, but fungus can live in every living cell of your body including your skin cells. Symptoms of rash etc often are not shown until the fungus is out of control.  In August 9th, 1969 a man named Dr Richard Day, who was at the time head of the Rockerfeller controlled eugenics organization Planned Parenting, addressed a meeting of doctors in Pittsburgh about the approach of of globalisation and how this would change our lives forever. He asked the attending doctors to turn off their recording equipment, to not take notes on what he was about to say. Before he went on to detail a long list of planned changes. One doctor did take notes, however and later talked publicly about what was said.    Now, 40 years later, we can actually see how extraordinarily accurate Dr Day was, as he said: “We can cure almost every cancer RIGHT NOW. Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute, if it’s ever decided that it should be released.” Yet, letting people die of cancer would “slow down population growth.” And that “You may as well die of cancer, as something else.”    Curing cancer is bad for business  Big Pharma has no desire to cure cancer when it is making vast fortunes from treating the symptoms with devastating drugs and cell-killing, people-killing poisons like chemotherapy. And it is not even primarily about money. It’s about population overgrowth and control. He who holds the purse strings owns the power.  Doctor Simoncini and Candida  An Italian doctor Tullio Simoncini, is a brilliant and courageous man who has refused to bow to such enormous pressure. He personally has faced and continues to face an unimaginable amount of amount of stress after he realized what cancer really is and how it can be dealt with.    Simoncini’s ‘crime’ has been to discover that cancer is actually a fungus caused by Candida, a yeast-like organism that lives in the body in small amounts, even in healthy people. The immune system normally keeps it under control, but when the Candida morphs into a powerful fungus some serious health problems can follow, often in the form of cancer.      In fact Simoncini says that cancer is Candida fungal infection and that the conventional medical explanation of cancer as a cellular malfunction is plain wrong.. And we at Healing Oracle have to agree.  Candida  From the time he entered medicine he realized that something was seriously wrong with the way cancer was treated:  “I saw terrible sufferings. I was in a paediatric oncological ward – all the children died. I was suffering when I was looking at the poor, poor children dying with chemo, with radiation.”  And It was this that led him to search for new ways to understand and treat this devastating disease.  Simoncini realized that all cancers acted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white. Simoncini realized thatacted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white.  Cancer cells are white  I was fortunate enough to take a 2 year study in autopsy, where it was confirmed, without any doubt at all, that ALL patients that died with cancer had fungus in more than one part of the body. What else is white? Candida.    So what if Mainstream medicine believes cancer to be simply cell growth going wild, or “cancerous growth,” actually the immune system producing cells to defend the body from Candida attack and the sequence goes like this:  In a healthy body, Candida is kept under control by the immune system, but when that becomes undermined and weakened, so the Candida can expand and build a “colony.” This colony, eventually penetrates an organ and the immune system has to respond to the threat in another way. It builds a defensive barrier of cells around the colony and this growth becomes a lump in the body and becomes identified as “cancer”. The spread of this cancer is then triggered by the Candida fungus, escaping. Often due to a biopsy, or surgery, where the protective barrier of cells is pierced open and the candida is set free to spread elsewhere in the body.      The immune system  So if it’s the immune system that contains the Candida, so it seems as there has been a calculated war on this very system. A silent war that has gained strength over time and become more vociferous with every decade.  The immune system is weakened and attacked by food and drink additives, chemical farming, vaccinations , frequencies, pharmaceutical drugs, the stress of modern ‘life’ and so much more.  Cure Candida with Ozone  Ozone is the number one cure for fungus moulds and pathogens. Ordinary Oxygen molecules consist of only two atoms. The third atom in Ozone only stays attached until it can react with, or oxidize, another substance. If that substance is a bacteria cell or fungi, it’s doomed; the spare oxygen atoms in the ambient ozone attach to the cell walls of microorganisms and crack them open.  Ozone machines  Ozone is a naturally occurring gas created from oxygen atoms. Ozone-disinfecting systems have become popular for people wishing to clean fruit and vegetables, for keeping rooms and hot tubs clean and have been around for several years.  Oxygen is harvested from the air filtering out nitrogen and moisture to get pure oxygen, which is then passed through Corona discharge cells, which deliver a jolt of electricity that turns the O2 into O3. The process leaves oxygen and nitrogen, which is environmentally safe.  The oxygen molecule is made up of 2 oxygen atoms. These oxygen molecules are broken into atoms by the ‘corona discharge’ during lightning storms, or by UV light from the Sun. Single oxygen atoms cannot exist alone without regrouping back into di-atomic  oxygen molecules. During this recombination stage some atoms will regroup into loosely bonded tri-atomic oxygen. This new molecule is called Ozone, as seen to the right d = 1.28 A, Theta = 116.5o. Due to the loose bond in this oxygen molecule – ozone is a very strong oxidant and an ideal chemical-free purification and a disinfecting agent.  Ozone is frequently misdiagnosed and equated to low-altitude pollution. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact, Ozone breaks down pollutants and should be welcomed when found in the air. The most effective way to produce Ozone commercially is through the use of pulse injected corona discharge. Disinfection by tri-atomic oxygen Ozone occurs through the rupture of the cell wall. An ozone level of 0.  4 ppm for 4 minutes has been shown to kill any bacteria, virus, mould and fungus.  Ozonated Water  Use Ozone to disinfect both water and the bottles you drink from. Drink 4oz of Ozonated water daily.  Ozone IV  Ozone can be administered via I.V to a patient 3 times a week and up-to 90ml for 2 weeks to ensure all fungus is gone.  For feet candida we suggest Hyperbaric Ozone boots.      Disclaimer  This is a very delicate procedure and should never be attempted at home. Always consult with a fully trained medical professional who fully understands all aspects of Ozone therapy and the risks involved if it is not administered, or monitored correctly.  So if cancer is fungus, is there a common, natural way to kill it and stop it spreading? Well the answer is actually in most people’s kitchen cupboard.  SODIUM BICARBONATE Yes, the main ingredient in good old Baking Soda whilst of course baking soda, contains other ingredients, it’s the Sodium Bicarbonate itself that provides the solution. In fact, it’s such a powerful weapon against fungus, unlike any synthesised drugs, the Candida simply cannot ‘adapt’ to it.  How it works  The patient is given Sodium bicarbonate orally and internally via an endoscope a long thin camera tube, used to see inside the body which allows the Sodium bicarbonate to be placed directly on the cancer fungus itself. Preventing any growth and killing the candida infestation.  Dr Simocini’s many successes have been down played and no clinical trials conducted. It’s a relatively simple and cheap solution and yet all this time millions of people are dying from cancers that could have been treated easily and effectively.  Understanding Salvestrols  In April 2017, two British scientists and researchers, Professor Gerry Potter of the Cancer Drug Discovery Group and Professor Dan Burke published a newsletter. Their combined findings reveal the following:  Cancer cells have a unique ‘biomarker’ that normal cells do not, an enzyme called CYP1B1 pronounced sip-one-bee-one. Enzymes are proteins that ‘catalyze’ increase the rate of chemical reactions.    Organic Fruit and veg  The CYP1B1 alters the chemical structure of something called Salvestrols that are found naturally in many fruit and vegetables. This chemical change turns the salvestrols into an agent that kills cancer cells, but does not harm healthy cells.  The synchronicity is perfect. The CYP1B1 enzyme appears only in cancer cells and it reacts with salvestrols in fruit and vegetables to create a chemical substance that kills only cancer cells.  Salvestrols is the natural defence system found in fruit and vegetables and especially those that are subject to fungus damage. And alarmingly, the chemical fungicide sprays used in modern farming, only artificially kills fungus, which means the plants and crops do not have to trigger their own defence mechanism salvestrols. And so this is why only organic and non GMO foods contain the Salevestrols your body needs to fight cancer.  In fact, the most widely-used fungicides are such powerful blockers of CYP1B1 that if you eat enough chemically-produced food it wouldn’t matter how many salvestrols you then consumed, they are no longer effective as the cancer-destroying agent they are designed to be.  More on the effects of fungus  The biggest cause of fungus is on our feet. We bathe or shower and forget about our feet, that serve us so well. It is important to lift each foot to wash and thoroughly dry them. Wearing open toe shoes as much as possible to allow your feet to breath.  Sneakers should only be worn for training, not for everyday purpose. Sprinkling bicarbonate of soda on your feel after drying is very helpful. Dead skin builds up on the feet, becoming bacteria and fungus.  Removing all dead skin from feet is extremely important.Expose feet as much as possible. Make friends with your feet, become well antiquated and give them some love.  We suggest Ozonation of feet in bad cases for a speedy recovery.  Fungus infections can vary significantly Some fungal infections are mild skin rashes, but others can be deadly, like fungal pneumonia. Because of this, it’s important to eradicate any fungus as soon as possible to try to avoid serious infection.  Fungal infections can look like bacterial or viral nfections. Which is a very common mistake and the resulting antibiotics are ineffective and can lead to gut flora issues later down the line.  The type of cancer you have can affect your risk. If you have a blood cancer like leukemia or myeloma, you may be at an even greater risk of further fungal infection than people with other types of cancer.  Your risk of infection can change based on the strength of your chemotherapy. Aggressive chemotherapy completely depletes your immune system and can put you at risk of getting a fungal infection that will fuel the cancer.  Your hospital stay matters. The longer you are in hospital the greater the risk of fungal infection due the hospitals heating system running at temperatures perfect for breading fungus, bacteria and infection.  Where you live geography matters. Some disease-causing fungi are more common in certain parts of the world. If you live in, or visit these areas and have cancer you may be more likely to get these infections than the general population. Humidity also promote fungus and bacteria.  Preventing fungal infections in cancer patients. Fungi are difficult but not impossible to avoid because they are a natural part of the environment. It lives outdoors, in soil, on plants, trees and other vegetation. They are also on many indoor surfaces and on your skin. However, there may be some ways for you to lower the chances of getting an infection, including a serious fungal infection.  Know if your white blood cell count is low. Having a very low white blood cell count can put you at greater risk of infection and fungus.  Protect yourself from the environment. As you start to recover from the effects of As you start to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and start doing your normal activities again, there are some ways to lower the chances of getting a serious fungal infection by trying to avoid disease-causing fungi in the environment:  Try to avoid areas with a lot of dust like construction, or excavation sites.  Stay inside during dust storms.  Stay away from areas with bird and bat droppings. This includes places like chicken coops and caves.  Wear gloves when handling materials such as soil, moss, or manure.  Wear long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when doing outdoor activities such as gardening, yard work, or visiting wooded areas and completely wash and dry your feet after walks.  Using 1 cup of apple cider vinegar or half a cup of bicarbonate of soda in a bath tub, or bucket for feet will stop fungus growing.  dehumidifiers in the home will take help take out moisture in the room.  Vacuum AC units every 2 weeks and lightly spray air conditioner filters with apple cider vinegar solution, 1 cup to 1 ltr of water  Don’t forget to do the same with your vehicle.    Cancer-Fungus and the Connection  Another link between fungi and cancer is their relationship with sugar and Gluten. Healthy cells in our bodies use glucose and oxygen to produce ATP adenosine triphosphate, which is the main source of energy for cell functions. Cancer cells, on the other hand, use fermentation to produce ATP. Fermentation does not use oxygen and is, in general, a very inefficient way to produce energy. Cancer cells must consume large amounts of sugar in order to survive and grow.  Cancer cells love fungus and fungus thrives on sugar and gluten. What is the first thing you do when candida gets out of control? That’s right ? lay off the sugar and simple carbs like bread and pasta.  In addition, growing fungi produce chemicals called mycotoxins, which have played some part in the development of cancer in humans according to experimental data. The connection between mycotoxins and cancer lies in its ability to effect the protein production within cells. For example, it can effect protein 53, a protein that, when healthy, can activate other proteins that repair DNA.  According to Dr. Lynn Jennings, family practitioner and medical writer: “A defective p53 protein could allow abnormal cells to proliferate, resulting in cancer. As many as 50% of all human tumors contain p53 mutations.”  If Cancer is a Fungus, Lets Treat it Like a Fungus  Dr. A.V. Constantini, retired head of the World Health Organization’s center for mycotoxins in food, believes that an anti-fungal cancer medication may be just over the horizon. Over the last decades, there has been some anecdotal evidence to support this prediction.  Dr. Simoncini, on the other hand is more doubtful because of the basic nature of fungi itself. “They are social elements,” he says. “They network and they will adapt.”  Dr. Simoncini’s solution to heal cancer naturally is simple. It adheres to the basic principles of natural cancer therapies and to my 7 Essentials ™ System, an evidence-based approach to support and heal the body naturally: change the internal environment in the body from one of acidity which cancer cells love to alkalinity.  Dr. Simoncini recommends the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy. Because the most effective way to shrink tumors is through direct contact with the sodium bicarbonate, in most cases a catheter is used to go through the arteries to the organs within the body.  For some cancers, including breast cancer, a simple local infiltration or injection can be used instead. Dr. Simoncini himself claims that this method carries a 99% success rate for healing breast cancer without surgery.  One can also enjoy an alkaline Sodium bicarbinate drink every day. In a glass of purified water, add the juice of ½ lemon and 1 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate. Stir and enjoy. Because this is such an alkaline drink, always consume it 30 minutes before and at least two hours after a meal as proper digestion requires an acidic pH in the stomach.  In order to prevent breast cancer naturally, be aware of the signs and follow a healthy anti-cancer regime that includes the anti-fungus diet, herbal supplementation, detoxing, emotional healing, biological dentistry, energy balancing and early detection. Maintaining the proper alkaline balance in your body is key to keeping fungal growth ? and breast cancer ? at bay.  There has yet to be discovered any antibiotic that is truly effective in the virus arena. There are indications that DNA viruses such as Herpes are  implicated in human cancers, since they organize the genetic material of the host cell to produce new viruses. Ozone will inactivate viruses on contact, even at very low residual concentrations. In case of polio, only 0.012 ppm removes all viral cells in less than 10 seconds.  Mold, fungus and mildew are easily controlled by Ozone presenting air and in water. Giardia and Cryptosporidium cysts are susceptible to Ozone but not affected by normal levels of Chlorine. The Effects of Ozone on Pathogens The antipathogenic effects of ozone have been substantiated for several decades.  Its killing action upon bacteria, viruses, fungi, and in many species of protozoa, serve as the basis for its increasing use in disinfecting municipal water supplies in cities worldwide.  Bacteria are microscopically small single-cell creatures having a primitive structure. They take up foodstuffs and release metabolic products, and multiply by division. The bacteria body is sealed by a relatively solid cell membrane. Their vital processes are controlled by a complex enzymatic system.  Ozone interferes with the metabolism of bacterium cells, most likely through inhibiting and blocking the operation of the enzymatic control system. A sufficient amount of ozone breaks through the cell membrane, and this leads to the destruction of the bacteria. Viruses are small, independent particles, built of crystals and macromolecules. Unlike bacteria, they multiply only within the host cell. Ozone destroys viruses by diffusing through the protein coat into the nucleic acid core, resulting in damage of the viral RNA.  At higher concentrations, ozone destroys the capsid or exterior protein shell by oxidation. Indicator bacteria in effluents, namely coliformas and  pathogens such as Salmonella, show marked sensitivity to ozone inactivation. Other bacterial organisms susceptible to ozone’s disinfecting properties include:  Streptococci, Shigella, legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aerunginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacteria, Kelbsiella, pneumonia, and Escherichia coli. Ozone destroys both aerobic and importantly, anaerobic bacteria which are mostly responsible for the devastating sequel of complicated infections, as exemplified by decubitus ulcers and gangrene. The mechanisms of ozone bacterial destruction need to be further elucidated.  It is known that the cell enveloped of bacteria are made of polysaccharides and proteins and that in Gram negative organisms, fatty acid alkyl chains and helical lipoproteins are present. In acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, on third to one half of the capsule is formed of complex lipids esterified mycolic acid, in addition to normal fatty acids, and glycolipids sulfolipids, lipopolysaccharides, mycosides, trehalose mycolates. The high lipid content of the cell walls of these ubiquitous bacteria may explain their sensitivity, and eventual demise, subsequent to ozone exposure. Ozone may also penetrate the cellular envelope, directly affecting cytoplasmic integrity, disrupting any one of numerous levels of its metabolic complexities.  Numerous families of viruses including poliovirus I and 2, human rotavruses, Norwalk virus, Parvoviruses, and Hepatitis A, B and non-A non-B?, among many others, are susceptible to the virucidal actions of ozone. Most research efforts on ozone’s virucidal effects have centered upon ozone’s propensity to break apart lipid molecules at sites of multiple bond configuration. Indeed, once the lipid envelope of the virus is fragmented, its DNA or RNA core cannot survive.  Non-enveloped viruses Adenoviridae, Picornaviridae, namely poliovirus, Coxsachie, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, Hepatitis A and E, and Reoviridae Rotavirus, have also begun to be studied. Viruses that do not have an envelope are called “naked viruses.” They are constituted of a nucleic acid core made of DNA or RNA and a nucleic acid coat, or capsid, made of protein. Ozone, however, aside from its well-recognized action upon unsaturated lipids, can also interact with certain proteins and their constituents, namely amino acids. Indeed, when ozone comes in contact with capsid proteins, protein hydroxides and protein hydroxides and protein hydroperoxides are formed. Viruses have no protections against oxidative stress. Normal mammalian cells, on the other hand possess complex systems of enzymes i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, which tend to ward off the nefarious effects of free radical species and oxidative challenge. It may thus be possible to treat infected tissues with ozone, respecting the homeostasis derived from their natural defences, while neutralizing offending and attacking pathogen devoid of similar defences.  The enveloped viruses are usually more sensitive to physico-chemical challenges than are naked virions. Although ozone’s effects upon unsaturated lipids is one of its best documented iochemical action, ozone is known to interact with proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. This becomes especially relevant when ozone inactivation of non-enveloped virions is considered.  Fungi families inhibited and destroyed by exposure to ozone include Candida, Aspergilus, Histoplasma, Actinomycoses, and Cryptococcus. The walls of fungi are multilayered and re composed of approximately 80% carbohydrates and 10% of proteins and glycoproteins. The presence of many disulfide bonds had been noted, making this a possible site for oxidative inactivation by ozone. In all likelihood, however, ozone has the capacity to diffuse through the fungal wall into the organismic cytoplasm, thus disrupting cellular organelles. Protozoan organisms disrupted by ozone include Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and free-living amoebas, namely Acanthamoeba, Hartmonella, and Negleria. The anit-protozoal action has yet to be elucidated.

Some of the most common causes of this type of infection are dirt, pollution, accumulated sweat as a result of wearing very tight socks and shoes for a longer period of time and walking in dirty water during rainy season. Not washing and ignoring them can lead to harmful consequences.  Here are 7 home remedies you can try to treat toenail fungus.  Tea tree oil contains antifungal and antiseptic abilities, which is very effective in fighting against toenail fungus. Apply few drop of the tea tree oil directly onto the affected nail with a cotton swab. Repeat this twice daily.  Both apple cider vinegar and white vinegar are considered as powerful home remedies to get rid of fungal infections because of its acidic properties.  Soak the infected nail in one part vinegar and two parts warm water for up to 20 minutes everyday. After that, rinse off with water.  Like tea tree oil, garlic, which is a staple in most kitchens, too has antifungal and antimicrobial properties. You can treat toenail fungus by placing crushed garlic cloves on the affected area for half an hour.  Then after it becomes dry, rinse off with water.  Real Organic Honey helps kill fungus and bacteria by flushing out toxins from the body as it contains hydrogen peroxide. Take a tablespoon of honey and apply it on the toenail. Keep for half an hour and then wash off with water. Repeat this twice on a daily basis.  You can use baking soda not only to treat nail fungus, but also to eliminate foot odour. You need to prepare a mixture for this:  Take a bowl and pour 4 cups of hot water, half cup of baking soda, one-fourth cup of hydrogen peroxide and half cup of Epsom salt.  Mix these ingredients properly and add one-fourth cup of white vinegar. Soak the infected nail",CANCER IS CANDIDA/FUNGUS AND CAN BE CURED,FALSE
10caf08a,"Why does it look like the state is testing at only a quarter of its lab capacity?  Why does it look like Wisconsin’s positive test rate has exploded?  Is DHS making a simple math error?  Is DHS throwing away hundreds of thousands of negative test results to make its math work?  Is the Evers Administration making key decisions using bad math?  September 23, 2020  A fundamental flaw in how the Evers’ Administration calculates Wisconsin’s daily COVID-19 positive test rate has excluded hundreds of thousands of test results and led to a wildly distorted picture of the state’s progress in confronting the virus.  The positive test rate is important, because it is one of six gating criteria the Evers’ Administration uses to make public health policy decisions that affect the entire state. Specifically, the requirement is for the “Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period.”  Throughout August and September, Wisconsin’s positive test rate steadily increased from a weekly average of 6.2% to 19% as of Sep. 21st.  The number of new people with a positive test result each day is less important, but gets more attention. That’s not surprising because the Department of Health Services DHS posts the number of new positive cases each day prominently at the top of its summary dashboard, while one must hunt for the actual test rate on the page.  As the test rate has steadily ticked up over the past two months, Wisconsin has had five record setting days for the number of new positive cases. Most of the increase has occurred among the 18-24 age group and is tied to college campuses. That’s where public officials are now focusing their efforts, but not every reporter has forgotten the importance of the rate.  “What’s behind the rise in percent positive rates?” Wispolitics’ Stephanie Hoff bluntly asked Dr. Ryan Westergaard, Wisconsin’s Chief Medical Officer on Sep. 15th.  This systematic error means DHS is tossing hundreds of thousands of negative test results when calculating the positive test rate. The real rate could be half of what DHS claims.  “Well, it’s a ratio so it has two components: the numerator – the top number of course is the number of positive cases,” he replied. “The bottom number of the ratio is the denominator. That’s the number of people that have been tested overall.”  This was an incredible admission. If the goal is to calculate the daily positive test rate, then DHS is using the wrong numerator and denominator. What they’re actually calculating is the daily percentage of new COVID-19 cases among those who have never been tested before – a fairly meaningless statistic. It is not the positive test rate.  On that same day, Sep. 15th, DHS recorded the rate as 11%. That was calculated by comparing 1,352 new cases to 12,266 new people tested. However, there were almost 20,000 tests collected that day. If DHS compared that day’s number of positive tests to the total number of test results, the rate would have been much lower – possibly as low as 6.7%. They’ve been making this same mistake since the spring.  This systematic error means DHS is tossing hundreds of thousands of negative test results when calculating the positive test rate. The real rate could be half of what DHS claims.  Origin of the Error  When it first started collecting COVID-19 data, DHS recognized that people were getting tested multiple times. Some people tested positive for the virus one week, and then still had it when they were retested a week later. If the department wasn’t careful, it might be accidentally counting single cases of COVID-19 over and over, and include them in the official tally. That would inflate Wisconsin’s total COVID-19 cases – a mistake that surely would be caught.  The department decided on a data collection method that would pick and choose which test results to use. Dr. Westergaard explained the reasoning during a June 11th press conference.  “Our data reports individuals tested. So, if an individual is tested more than once because they were being followed to see if they cleared the infection or if they were tested a couple times weeks apart, they would be considered a single case and not multiple cases in our data,” Westergaard explained.  DHS acknowledges this method on its data summary dashboard. The fine print plainly states “Multiple tests per person are not included in these summary statistics.”  And so, every day DHS compares the number of new COVID-19 cases to the number of people who were tested for the first time to determine the positive test rate. Under this method, it throws away the results for everyone that has ever been tested before. That means every day thousands of negative test results are not included in the rate calculation.  DHS has discarded hundreds of thousands of results since it began reporting COVID-19 data. Most people who are tested for COVID-19 receive negative test results.  As the pool of people who have never been tested before continues to shrink, the number of negative results getting tossed will naturally increase. Subsequently the positive test rate will continue to artificially rise.  Scope of the Error  Each day’s positive test rate needs to be calculated using all the test results from that day. Only DHS can correct this error, because only it has access to all the test results.  Although DHS’ website is filled with all kinds of COVID-19 related data – it does not post the total number of test results it receives each day. However, it does report the number of total tests collected by health care professionals across the state each day. That figure cannot be used to calculate the daily rate, because there is a lag from the time a test is collected and when the results come back.  Each day’s positive test rate needs to be calculated using all the test results from that day.  However, we can still get a good look at the problem using weekly averages.  Altogether, there have been approximately 2.1 million tests, 1.4 million people tested, and 101,321 positive cases as of Sep. 20th. Using DHS’ flawed methodology, officials have tossed around 600,000 test results in calculating the daily positive test rate. That results in an overall rate of 7%, while the real rate could be as low as 4.8%.  That might not seem like a big difference overall. However, public officials aren’t looking at the big picture. They’re looking at this rate on a day-to-day basis, and only 14 days back. The inherent flaws in DHS’ formula means the difference between the official rate and the real rate consistently grows.  When DHS first began collecting COVID-19 data, no one had been tested before, and few results were discarded. At that time, the rate calculated by DHS would have been fairly accurate.  However, as time goes on, more and more people are re-tested. That means more and more results are thrown out. Inevitably the rate will become more and more inaccurate unless DHS corrects its calculations.  Yesterday, 12,537 people in Wisconsin, who had never been tested before, got their #COVID19 test results. Those were the only results @DHSWI used to calculate the daily positive test rate. It’s been using this method from the beginning. https://t.co/8qx2wIe0lh #WIright pic.twitter.com/tYNOpDDVuW — MacIver Institute @MacIverWisc September 23, 2020  Testing Capacity  The cracks in DHS’ methodology are beginning to show.  The Evers Administration is increasingly confronted with questions it cannot answer even when the answers are right on DHS’ website.  For example, some reporters have noticed that the state’s lab capacity is much higher than – what they believe to be – the number of new test results each day.  In August, lab capacity was around 26,000 tests a day, and an average of 15,600 test were administered each day. That meant labs were running at about 60% capacity. In September, lab capacity increased to 38,000 tests a day, and an average of 20,685 tests were administered each day. That meant labs were running at about 54% capacity. However, the way DHS presents its data could lead some to believe there are only around 10,000 tests being administered each day – or about 26 – 38%.  “Why do we continue to be at a quarter the rate of testing capacity? Is it a shortage of supplies or people just not getting tested?” a reporter asked Palm at a press conference on Sep. 16th.  “This is certainly a complicated question and therefor a complicated answer and some of it is just speculation,” Palm replied.  Clearly, the reporter was confused or did not realize that the number of new people being tested is different from the number of tests being collected. Palm had the opportunity to correct this confusion, but she either didn’t listen to the question or doesn’t understand the issue herself.  Even Dr. Westergaard, who has repeatedly demonstrated his understanding of what data is available and how the rate is calculated, has yet to point out the complete truth of these fundamental issues.  That reporter is not the first one to ask why test numbers always appear to be well below the state’s capacity. Once reporters begin to understand the difference between individuals tested and the number of tests actually collected, they will be able to identify the bad math DHS uses to calculate Wisconsin’s rate. They will then be able to ask why the state is making public policy decisions based on this bad math.  Whether or not the Evers Administration or the Capitol press corps figure this out on their own eventually won’t matter. As the number of new individuals getting tested continues to drop, the day will come when there are more positive test results than new individuals being tested. Once the daily positive test rate rises above 100%, no one will be able to ignore the math any longer.  Solving the Problem  DHS was right to take steps to ensure its total case count was accurate, but the positive test rate is just as important.  DHS should also calculate the positive test rate every day using all the results from that day. Since no one is tested twice in the same day, this will ensure that each day’s rate is accurate. That will ensure the gating requirement is reflecting the correct data.  This is something DHS could start doing today. It needs to start doing this today, because it’s current method is producing inaccurate results – which the Evers Administration continues to use in its gating criteria to make pivotal public policy decisions that affect everyone in Wisconsin.

e7397a29,"Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a series about how branches of the military hate on each other. We’ll feature all branches of the U.S. military, written by veterans of that branch being brutally honest with themselves and their services.  The branches of the U.S. military are like a very large family. They deal with one another because they have to, not because they always get along.  The differences don’t stop at uniforms. Each branch has its own goals, mission, and its own internal culture. At the upper levels of the services, they compete for funds and favor from civilians in DoD. In the lower ranks, they compete for fun and favor from civilians in bars and strip clubs especially in North Carolina. The branches are like siblings, competing for the intangible title of who’s “the best” from no one in particular.  “The Soviets are our adversary. Our enemy is the Navy.” —Gen. Curtis LeMay, U.S. Air Force  Of course, when it comes to joint operations downrange, a lot of that goes out the window. But when the op-tempo isn’t as hectic and frustration has time to build, the awesome Army platoon who saved your ass last month become a bunch of damn stupid grunts who steal everything you don’t lock down and leave their Gatorade piss bottles everywhere. Parsing out the best and worst of our services isn’t hard if we’re honest with ourselves.  Here’s how the other branches hate on the Navy, how they should actually be hating on the Navy, how the Navy hates on the Navy, and why to really love the Navy.  The easiest ways to make fun of the Navy  Sailor harassment has its roots in the age-old reality that since man first decided to put military power to sea in ships, those aboard those ships were forced to spend weeks and months underway before being afforded a few days of downtime in a foreign port. As a result of this ratio, sailors may have had a tendency for exuberance while on liberty over the years. And that exuberance may have caused a scuffle or two that caught the attention of bar owners and other locals who may have developed impressions that were less than positive.  Over time these locals spread rumors that these sailors couldn’t hold their liquor and tended to burn through what little cash they had in a short time. Word of these phenomena returned stateside, which gave birth to the saying, “spending money like a sailor on liberty.”  Because sailors spend time on the water, service members from other military branches wanted to give them a nickname that was both sufficiently pejorative and germane. Naturally marine life came to mind. “Sharks” was too cool and tough and “guppies” was too cute, so they settled on “squids.” So if you want to make fun of a sailor call him or her a “squid.” They really hate that because squids are spineless and ugly and otherwise devoid of personality. They can swim fast, but nobody really cares about that.  Because SEALs. In the wake of the Bin Laden raid, SEALs have managed to morph from silent professionals to the warfare specialty that is quick to tell all to land book and movie deals.  Because Top Gun. No other military movie in history has done more to give the public the wrong idea about what it means to serve. And it’s got a lot of homoerotic imagery, which leads to . . .  . . . The quickest way to strike a squid’s nerve is to make “gay” jokes. Yes, you know the kind, “100 sailors go out, 50 couples come back,” or “it ain’t gay if it’s under way,” and many, many more. It also doesn’t help that sailors are a popular gay fantasy.  Henri Belolo created the Village People around macho male stereotypes that gays fantasize about. The cowboy, cop, construction worker, leather-clad biker, Indian, and the sailor. The band became popular, moved into the mainstream and took the sailor in the cute Crackerjack uniform along with it. Yes, we said “cute.” Admit it, the sailor dress uniform has more in common with the Japanese school girl uniform than with the other service branches.  Not that there’s anything wrong with being gay, of course. This is, after all, the post-DADT world.  Because nuclear power. While the introduction of this science gave Navy ships the ability to sail a long, long time without refueling, the existence of it also created a zero-tolerance culture that has raised the bar of fun suppression to heights that can never be lowered. And this ability to sweat the load has crossed over into other warfare specialties and other branches of the military. Thanks, Nukes . . .  Why to actually hate the Navy  Every service tries to imitate the Marine Corps when it comes to celebrating its birthday, and the Navy’s history makes this in many ways the biggest joke which is a polite way to say “the biggest lie”. While the Navy uses October 13, 1775 as the birth date, they leave out the fact that the first version of the U.S. Navy was dismantled completely after the Revolutionary War because the ragtag bunch of vessels they managed to assemble on the fly did little to protect ports or disrupt the British in any way.  John Paul Jones kicks some British butt. Congress appreciated it so much they dismantled the Navy after the war.  And this anti-Navy sentiment in and around DC lasted a while after that. Thomas Jefferson hated the idea of a standing Navy and few in Congress thought any differently about it. It wasn’t until early Navy badass Stephen Decatur decided to take a couple of ships to Tripoli to raise some Yankee hell against the Barbary Pirates. His successes made lawmakers take notice and actually warm to the idea of a standing Navy, and one with an over-the-horizon outlook.  Decatur Boarding a Tripolitan Gunboat. Painting by Dennis M. Carter  So the real birth date of the Navy would be somewhere around 1810 when Decatur took the USS United States up and down the east coast to show the American public what they had in terms of seagoing capability.  Hate SAPR training and the CYA leadership atmosphere you’re currently serving under? Blame the Navy.  All the mechanisms that surround using the military as a social experiment and other morale-sapping things that get labeled as “politically correct” started with the Tailhook Scandal in the early ’90s. Of course, sexual battery, never mind harassment, is a bad thing that should never be tolerated, but Navy leadership over the years has done little to stop agenda-based over-corrections that have marginalized the culture in undesirable ways in the eyes of those who intimate they know about warfighting and such.  So, regardless of your branch, if you feel like you’re serving in a nanny state, blame the Navy.  Because Jimmy Carter. He’s a Naval Academy grad and a submariner, but he never really acted like it when he was Commander-in-chief. His “man is inherently good” naivete made for some very bad foreign policy, most notably in how he de-fanged the CIA and emboldened the Iranian government to take Americans hostage for 444 days. And the Desert One rescue attempt was a disaster. Basically his time in the White House made the country very happy to see Ronald Reagan.  And because the Navy is the absolute worst when it comes to changing uniforms. Remember aviation greens? How about service dress khaki? No? Well, here’s one for you: aquaflage. What are you hiding in, the water? And if a sailor is in the water don’t you want to be able to see him or her? We rest our case.  Because they wrecked most of what was cool about the band Godsmack and made them corporate sellouts.  Because sailors don’t have to eat MREs when they deploy. Ships are built with mess decks and Navy cooks and supply officers generally take pride in serving the crew good food.  Why to love the Navy  Because Navy SEALs. They popped OBL and the Somali pirates and many more high value bad actors since 9-11. Their warfighting skills are second to none.  Because Hollywood remains enamoured by Navy life, it keeps teeing up Navy-themed shows like “The Last Ship,” and as a result, the general public has a favorable opinion of the military.  Because strike warfare. As has been the case throughout history U.S. Navy carriers and surface combatants were the first on the scene after 9-11, and because of that we were able to take it to the enemy a mere three weeks after the homeland was attacked.  Because the U.S. Navy really is, as the commercials state, “a global force for good.” From Hurricane Katrina to the Haitian earthquake to the tsunami in Thailand, when a country needs humanitarian assistance, the Navy has always been first on the scene.

U.S. Navy photo by Capt. Paul Duncan  Because the Navy continues to fight “the war between the wars.” The Navy goes to potentially hostile places like the littorals of Yemen and Chinese-claimed islands to prove to those nations that we’re willing to protect the sea lanes to keep goods moving safely to and from our shores.

52091c5f,"President Trump has ordered Guantanamo Bay to prepare for incoming ‘high level’ prisoners, including American politicians, within the next few months.  According to a Military of Defense report, Trump is preparing to transfer an unknown number of ‘VIP’ American detainees to the notorious prison in preparation for their trials before a US Military Tribunal.  Reports suggest that people connected to the Uranium One scandal are being placed in custody in preparation for the trials.  Hundreds of US Army Military Police have also been deployed to Cuba to help oversee the process.  According to the DoD report, while conducting routine training missions in Cuba, intercepted an unusually large number of encrypted communications emanating between the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Cuba and Luke Air Force Base Arizona—immediately after which they made a request to SVR counterintelligence analysts for an explanation of—with the SVR, in turn, then reporting to SCT that these communications were being conducted between the Guantanamo Military Commission that holds US Military Tribunals and US Attorney Generals Jeff Sessions.  On 11 April 2017, also, this report says, the SVR reported to SCT that Attorney General Sessions was at Luke Air Force Base to “hold/conduct” meetings with various commanders of the Arizona Army National Guard AZ ARNG—with the longest of them being with the commanders of the 850th Military Police Battalion—that numbers nearly 800 highly trained and specialized US Army Military Police forces.  Since its beginning on 11 April 2017, this report continues, SCT intercepts of communications between Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Luke Air Force Base continued on an unprecedented basis—with the largest amount of such communications being reported on 7 July 2017—and was the date Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made an unannounced visit to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base—and whose meetings there on that date included the commanders of the 850th Military Police Battalion who had been flown there the day prior.  The specific type of communication intercepts noted by SCT occurring between Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Luke Air Force Base, this report details, were encrypted video satellite broadcasts transmitted at the North American standard rate of 59.94 frames per second—and whose near predictable times of transmission suggested to SVR analysts that these video broadcasts were being used for classroom instruction.  On 21 December 2017, this report further notes, SCT reported that nearly all of these communications between Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Luke Air Force Base had ceased—with the SVR reporting that this cessation occurred when US Defense Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis made an unprecedented-unannounced visit to Guantanamo—the first visit there by a US Defence Secretary in nearly 16 years—and that in doing, Secretary Mattis shockingly broke with the longstanding tradition of persons holding his high office visiting American troops on the front lines—but that he deemed his sudden visit to Guantanamo was vitally more important than.  And as to how “vitally important” Secretary Mattis deemed his unprecedented visit to Guantanamo, this report says, became known yesterday, 29 December 2017, when President Trump suddenly ordered the entire 850th Military Police Battalion to immediately deploy from Luke Air Force Base to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.  With the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp holding only 41 detainees, but able to hold nearly 800, this report notes, President Trump’s suddenly ordering there such a large number of US Military Police forces requires a further explanation as to why—and which the SVR says can be found in the equally sudden activity of the secretive IBC Airways—and whom, upon President Trump’s ordering the 850th Military Police Battalion to immediately deploy to Guantanamo, announced, on 29 December 2017, that it is increasing its flights to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to three times a week—thus highly suggesting its anticipation of a flood of visitors there—most likely to include American attorneys defending their soon to be imprisoned traitorous clients.  To the likelihood of President Trump actually imprisoning his “Deep State” enemies, who are currently engaged in a coup against him, General Staff Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevtsova in this report lays out the trail that Trump’s been following since he first took office—and whose clues can be found in his “extreme vetting” immigration plan—the long history of which his enemies have ignored to their peril.  Though not known to the American people, this report explains, “Deep State” aligned leftist US Federal Judges have been battling Trump over his “extreme vetting” plans since the very week he took office—with their reason being because Trump has asserted his power to act based upon “one of the most controversial and least understood laws in the history of the United States”—that’s known as McCarran Act or Internal Security Act of 1950 that allows for the detention of dangerous, disloyal, or subversive persons in times of war or “internal security emergency”.  As founding FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had warned the US Congress in the late 1940’s that “it only took twenty-three Commies to overthrow Russia”, this report continues, the Internal Security Act of 1950 was enacted into law in order to protect the American president and government from an internal coup like the one Trump is now facing—and that President Trump, on 21 December 2017—the exact same day Secretary Mattis made his sudden visit to Guantanamo—enacted the first phase of by his signing an Executive Order declaring that America, indeed, was now in a state of “National Emergency”—with his exactly naming, too, the Hillary Clinton linked persons seeking to overthrow the US government.  Mostly unknown to the American people when President Trump arrests and detains for US Military Tribunal trials in Guantanamo these “Deep State” coup plotters, this report further notes, is that it was actually President Barack Obama who, in 2012, signed this presidential power into law with the feared National Defense Authorization Act—and that authorizes the indefinite military detention, without charge or trial, of any person labeled a “belligerent”—including an American citizen.  Equally unknown to the vast majority of the American people, too, this report concludes, is that the current “Deep State” coup plot against President Trump is not the first one their nation has faced either—but is, in fact, its second—with the first being in 1933 when the “Deep State” launched the “Business Plot Coup” against President Franklin Roosevelt in order so they could join the United States with the globalist power Nazi Germany—with this coup plot being led by the Nazi-aligned Bush Family—but with this coup being destroyed by US Marine General Smedley Butler—whose mighty shoes US Marine General James “Mad Dog” Mattis now stands in so that he, too, might save his nation.",Trump Orders Guantanamo Bay To Prepare For 'High Level' Prisoners,FALSE

According to the ad Soros placed on Craigslist, protesters would be fully compensated for all of their time and expenses. They found out that the money dried up the moment they got arrested.  A spokesman for the Soros company, Paid Liberal Trolls of America, says the men and women who signed up were told up-front that they should obey the law and not go to jail:  “They were paid for 6 hours at $30 per hour, plus a meal stipend of $40 per day. Add to that a very generous 70 cents per mile for travel and a big cookie, and these people were given neary $1K to be there. All they had to do was go home before curfew. They chose to stay, so they can pay their own bail.”  Soros has a bad habit of not paying bail for his protesters, citing case after case of people not showing up for court. “If they don’t show up. we don’t get those funds back, and we can’t write them off as a business expense,” said Attorney Joe Barron, “They should know better than to expect someone as kind as George Soros to just toss an extra $500 per person out the window.”  Some protesters might be satisfied with that answer, but most are not. According to their leader, Art Tubolls, the 163 people filing the suit will show at the Soros mansion in Deluth if they have to:  “We’re not afraid to protest for real. Charlie Kirk and Turning Point said they’ll fund that endeavor, even if it means he has to bail us out.

71986c29,"By Jim Francesconi  As we pass the governance torch from the State Board of Higher Education to independent boards at the University of Oregon, Portland State University and Oregon State University, we will be navigating a future of heightened risks and rewards.  The rewards lie in the private sector reinforcements that are coming to the aid of our three major research universities. The caliber of some board nominees are similar to those found at Stanford, Yale, Harvard and other prestigious private universities. Major Oregon CEOs and entrepreneurs have volunteered to use their power, influence and resources to benefit Oregon's public universities.  Oregon is a small state with limited public resources, great needs and high aspirations. Although our universities have a few of the nation's best programs, we are not living up to our potential. That is what happens when state funding for  becomes mired near the bottom of all states for more than 20 years. Now there is the promise to leverage private resources for this vital public purpose.  But there are risks as well. We need high-quality engineering and other research programs, but we cannot afford them at every campus. Portland needs to be served, with PSU in charge, but so does every part of our state. Our small schools should be strengthened, not sacrificed. Sports are important, but not the highest priority. As vital as universities are, they are means to public ends, not ends in and of themselves.  Oregon needs a vibrant, innovative economy. Our universities can create more research collaboratives such as ONAMI Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute and the Portland Life Sciences center, which attract world-class talent and create jobs. Next up ... the Light Metals Institute sponsored by Oregon and Washington universities and the Manufacturing 21 business coalition.  Oregon's per capita income is almost 10 percent below the national average. Universities can prepare more Oregonians for well-paid jobs in health care, STEM fields science, technology, engineering, mathematics, advanced manufacturing and professional-technical careers. And we should take advantage of the growing demographic and political strength of the Latino community by working together to provide access to college and to family-wage jobs.  Above all, Oregon must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000. As a result, fewer Oregonians are going to college. Like many, my grandparents and parents sacrificed so that I could be the first in my family to go to college. For the first time in Oregon's history, my generation is better educated than the generation that is now college age.  New university board members can raise scholarship funds so that more Oregonians can graduate from UO, PSU and OSU. But these board members should also help increase philanthropy at Southern, Western, Eastern and the Oregon Institute of Technology. All Oregonians from every part of the state should have a chance to achieve their potential and contribute to our state.  Finally, we must understand that philanthropy alone cannot produce excellent universities with innovative research, quality instruction and access for all Oregonians. The Legislature has consistently balanced the budget on the backs of students, forcing tuition increases. New board members have the power to reverse this practice and to force major public investments in our universities for the good of Oregon. Let us work together to apply that power to building an affordable and accessible world-class university system.

b57fd483,"BUFFALO, N.Y. WKBW — As people stay home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, the price of gas has slowly started to drop.  But in New York State, that’s not saying much.  That’s because New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00, according to numbers provided by the AAA of Western and Central New York.  Nationally, the average price of a gallon of gas is $1.77, compared to $2.89 a year ago.  In New York State, it's $2.18 per gallon, compared to $2.96 a year ago.  In Buffalo, gas is now $2.23 per gallon, compared to $2.88 a year ago.  “The oil prices have a direct impact on what we pay at the pump, so with these low oil prices and this low demand for gasoline right now, we're just seeing gas prices drop,” said Elizabeth Carey, spokeswoman for the AAA.  Oil demand first started to drop in China, she said, and government directives for the coronavirus now have people stuck at home here.  “Gas has been coming down for nine straight weeks since this all began,” Carey said of the outbreak and traveling restrictions.  But some motorists wonder why Western New Yorkers are not seeing more of a break here in local gas prices.  One 7 Eyewitness News viewer wrote, The gas stations will up their prices the second gas goes up even though the gas in the tanks was purchased at a lower market value. Are we paying over a dollar in taxes in NYS or are they gouging?  Another wrote, Why is gas on the reservation 97 cents? Add 46 cents taxes [and] why are we not paying $1.43 a [gallon] on regular gas stations? We [are] getting ripped off.  “You have to consider the New York State taxes,” Carey said.  That's right: she said higher gas prices are just a reality for motorists living in the Empire State. New Yorkers pay $0.65 in taxes for every gallon of gas they buy, and more than $0.45 are state taxes.  “Compare that to Ohio,” she said. “They charge about half of that in their state taxes. So their prices are much lower.”  By the time New Yorkers head back to work, she said, prices will likely start creeping back up.  “[If] they start raising that work-from-home limit, yeah, prices are going to go up,” she said. “There'll be a higher demand, but it's hard to say how much.”","Gas prices have dropped, but in N.Y. state they're still pretty high",TRUE
62e4d9e5,"A thorough marketing campaign for the use of low-quality masks has convinced millions of people that masks will reduce COVID-19 spread, but do they really?  State governments are enthusiastically mandating that everyone, even those who aren’t sick, wear masks when in public. While that might seem like a logical and even patriotic thing to do, what does the science actually say about mask efficacy and safety?  Top Doctors Initially Acknowledged Masks Don’t Work  In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci told us masks probably weren’t going to help protect us from the Wuhan virus. Joe Biden’s COVID-19 adviser Dr. Michael Osterholm similarly agreed that wearing masks is “largely” nonsense and that “trying to stop the flu [another respiratory virus] is like trying to stop the wind.”  These expert opinions were based on a meta-analysis of multiple studies about masks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s CDC’s website. It concluded, “We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons source control or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility.”  Fauci and Osterholm were also likely aware of numerous studies concluding that masks during surgery don’t prevent wound infections from particles doctors emitted from their mouths and noses. One study found that tracer particles placed on the inside of a surgeon’s mask ended up in the surgical wound.  Another study in Clinical Orthopedics blamed redirected airflow, saying, “The wearing of a surgical face mask had no effect upon the overall operating room environmental contamination and probably work only to redirect the projectile effect of talking and breathing.” Most recently, a September 2020 meta-review concluded, “Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in acute respiratory illness incidence in this meta-review.”  Much Recent Pro-Mask Research Is Deeply Flawed  The only statistically significant data on preventing viral spread is for N95 masks worn indoors when one can’t socially distance, which is not the type of mask required nor typically worn by the general public.  In favor of a few new, poorly designed studies, government leaders are ignoring the previous solid research that clearly demonstrates the typical cloth masks don’t work. The researchers in these new inferior studies somehow conclude that masks help, but you have to read the fine print: They have an unrealistic experimental design, confounding variables, and a “low certainty” of evidence.  Speaking of fine print, while the World Health Organization WHO recommends masks to the public, it acknowledges elsewhere, “At the present time, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence.”  One analysis published in the well-known medical journal The Lancet concluded masks help, but the study subjects wore masks along with all other protective health measures, meaning the contribution of masks to the study result can’t be conclusive. To its credit, it rated its evidence on masks as “low certainty,” yet this study is held up as “proof” that masks work.  Other studies, such as one from Nature, had participants blow into a tube or a box while wearing and not wearing various masks. If fewer particles were emitted from the front of the mask, researchers deemed that mask to be effective. That would be great, except measuring only the forward projection of particles completely misses the aerosols that escape from the edges of the mask. A person’s fogged glasses are a clear demonstration that masks do little to contain aerosols. Masks simply “redirect airflow,” as the Clinical Orthopedics study stated.  Another “definitive” study put rats in adjacent cages separated by a small hole completely covered by a new, dry mask. This experiment does not come close to approximating the effectiveness of the moist, bacteria-laden masks people wear in public, which leak aerosols out of the edges. Comparing masks covering rat air holes to those covering human faces is comparing apples and oranges.  All of these studies also used fresh masks only for a few minutes. The authors acknowledge that when masks get moistened by breath, they might allow for increased emission of viral particles. Indeed, it has been well demonstrated that masks accumulate microorganisms.  Finally, in one case study, a pair of COVID-19-infected hairdressers worked with masks, and their clients didn’t become ill. While this case is also widely viewed as proof masks work, important details were ignored.  First, many of the hairdressers’ clients declined to get tested, so we don’t know if they contracted COVID after contact with the hairdressers. Second, the clients who were in contact with the stylists when their viral load would have been highest were not included in this case study. Third, the hairdressers obviously had mild cases, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to nor allowed to work.  When did the science bar get so low, especially for something forced on the entire population?  Are Masks Actually Causing Harm?  “Maskne,” face rashes, “mask mouth,” and sore throats point to bacteria building up in masks due to the humid, stagnant air and changes in the oral microbiome, which can cause systemic inflammation and downstream disease. A 2015 study found that health-care workers who wore cotton face masks suffered from significantly more respiratory illness than those who wore surgical masks.  Previous research conducted by Fauci himself found that the main cause of death in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was from bacterial pneumonia. Inhaling higher bacterial counts with every breath sounds like an especially bad idea.  The WHO specifically recommends against wearing a mask while exercising because “masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably. Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms.”  Abundant research demonstrates masks cannot help prevent the spread of coronavirus, while much recent research claiming to support masks is weak and poorly designed. Frequent mask use by the general population increases bacteria and dust in our mouth and airways. A government mandating that everyone wear a mask based on such low-quality evidence is reckless and potentially harmful.  For now, let’s stick with the measures that do help: social distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding chronic disease. Only don a fresh, clean N95 mask for short periods of time when you’re unavoidably close to others indoors.",Many Studies Find That Cloth Masks Do Not Stop Viruses Like COVID,FALSE
fb238099,"Home » Biology, Breaking News, Health, North America, Science, Statistics / Polls » Russia exposes Covid-19 with Scientific Data as a Hoax, says its a Fake Pandemic  Russia has just released very important data which basically makes Coronavirus a fake pandemic. Moscow authorities have stated that at least 12.5% of its residents have developed antibodies to Covid-19, after taking samples from 50,000 people. It’s just the beginning of a massive survey that will see millions tested.  Moscow has a population of 12.5 million people and if 12.5% of them have antibodies, that would be 1,562,500 people already had Covid-19 and recovered without any symptoms or any treatment whatsoever. Of these, 1,934 have died. This means Covid-19 death rate is at about 0.12%, not much bigger than the ordinary A/H1N1 flu.  In fact the A/H1N1 flu is more deadly because it spreads at least 10 times faster and easier than Covid-19.  Even though A/H1N1 has a smaller death rate of about 0.04%, its much deadlier because it spreads faster and easier than Covid-19. We now know for a fact that this whole thing is a giant hoax, the biggest hoax in the history of mankind, far surpassing other past hoaxes like the 9/11 or the holocaust.  Despite having a very low death rate, Russia is now suspecting that not even all of those 1,934 Muscovites died of Covid-19 so they said that they will run autopsies to determine the exact cause of death, so expect the numbers to become even lower after they finish with the autopsies.  Here’s what Moscow’s Department of Health said:  “It’s impossible in other COVID-19 cases to name the cause of death. So, for example in over 60% of deaths the cause was clearly for different reasons such as vascular failures such as heart attacks, stage 4 malignant diseases, leukaemia, systemic diseases which involve organ failure, and other incurable fatal diseases.”  Belarus and Sweden refused to lockdown their citizens yet their death rates have also been tiny compared to other countries like the United States which has been exposed many times for faking the numbers.  Romania has also been caught faking the numbers, even bribing their citizens to declare that their relatives died of Covid-19. While Russia did not specifically said those words that this is a “hoax” and a “fake pandemic”, this is exactly what their data is showing, we had to use that title to draw attention to a very serious problem which is of concern to everyone.  Let’s not forget that this plandemic has resulted in job loss, poverty, bankrupcies and worse of all, suicides. Who the F will be held accountable for all the young people who suicided because of muh coronavirus hoax?  Now question… what about the poisonous vaccine which is about to be rolled out, they’re saying that they want everyone forcefully vaccinated… Including the people who already had coronahoax virus and recovered and are now immune??? If yes, isn’t it clear how much of a giant hoax this whole thing is?  Additionally, there is also an Official German COVID Secret Report Leak which Denounces Virus as ‘Global False Alarm’.

Related: Google is opening an artificial intelligence center in China  Luo Si, the chief scientist of natural language processing at the Chinese company's AI research group, called the milestone a great honor, but also acknowledged that it will likely lead to a significant number of workers losing their jobs to machines.  The technology can be gradually applied to numerous applications such as customer service, museum tutorials and online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the need for human input in an unprecedented way, Si said in a statement.  Alibaba has already put the technology to work on Singles Day, the world's biggest shopping bonanza, by using computers to answer a large number of customer service questions.  In a tweet, Pranav Rajpurkar, one of the Stanford researchers who developed the reading test, called Alibaba's feat a great start to 2018 for artificial intelligence.  Related: These three countries are winning the global robot race  The Stanford test generates questions about a set of Wikipedia articles.  For example, a human or AI program reads a passage about the history of British TV show Doctor Who and then answers questions like, What is Doctor Who's space ship called? Spoiler alert: It's the TARDIS, for non-Doctor Who fans out there.  Alibaba's deep neural network model scored 82.44 on the test on January 11, narrowly beating the 82.304 scored by the human participants. A day later, Microsoft's AI software also beat the human score, with a result of 82.650.  These kinds of tests are certainly useful benchmarks for how far along the AI journey we may be, said Andrew Pickup, a spokesman for Microsoft. However, the real benefit of AI is when it is used in harmony with humans, he added.  Facebook FB, Tencent TCEHY and Samsung SSNLF have also previously submitted AI models to the Stanford project.

e22f9df0,"PETITION: Tell the FDA to reverse its opposition to Hydroxychloroquine and help save lives! Sign the petition here.  September 26, 2020 LifeSiteNews – While Democrats and the mainstream media routinely attribute the United States’ relatively high number COVID-19 deaths to Americans’ failure to uniformly wear masks or “socially distance,” a new report suggests the true culprit may be the country’s unwillingness to embrace the drug hydroxychloroquine HCQ.  The United States is estimated to have seen 7.1 million COVID-19 cases as of September 25, with more than 200,000 deaths and 4.4 million recoveries. Officially it has the most cases in the world though that ranking is likely due in part to the authoritarian government of China’s refusal to share accurate numbers.  HCQ has long been approved for use in treating malaria, arthritis, and certain autoimmune conditions, but its potential applications to the coronavirus became a political lightning rod after President Donald Trump first called attention to early studies indicating its potential. The FDA initially issued an Emergency Use Authorization EUA allowing it to be distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile SNS but revoked that authorization in June, claiming “new information” indicated the potential dangers outweighed any potential effectiveness.  However, a white paper published this month by the Economic Standard argues that the primary roadblocks to HCQ are political rather than scientific.  “The U.S. is an international outlier on HCQ,” the paper says. “Right now, doctors around the world are prescribing HCQ to treat COVID-19 outside of hospitals, as well as prophylactically to prevent infection among healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. This paper argues that HCQ has met the appropriate burden of proof and urges members of the U.S. news media, public health community, and regulatory agencies to stop politicizing the use of this medicine. Tens of thousands of lives still hang in the balance.”  The paper lists more than two dozen medical conditions for which HCQ is an established treatment, which it says “reflect a general medical consensus, long predating the COVID-19 pandemic, that HCQ is a safe, well-tolerated drug.”  “In the U.S. alone from 2007-2017, patients received around 59 million prescriptions for HCQ,” the paper explains. “In over seven decades of use, there have been a handful of reports of fatal arrhythmias due to torsades de pointes from all drug causes, and zero reports of fatal arrhythmias with HCQ use. Most cases of arrhythmia involved extraordinary circumstances, including overdoses and patients with end-stage liver failure. Other side effects, such as retinopathy and kidney damage, result only from years of long-term use and have been described as ‘rare.’”  HCQ was identified as a potential COVID-19 treatment relatively early in the outbreak, and has been used in China, South Korea, France, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Malaysia, Bahrain, Poland, Russia, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, India, and the Philippines, “among many others,” the report says. Yet the United States remains an “international outlier on HCQ, as one of just a handful of countries that have moved to limit – rather than expand – patient access to the drug.”  This, it continues, was due in part to the American news media focusing on “low-quality or botched RTCs [randomized controlled trials] – misrepresenting these as the ‘gold standard’ – while dismissing observational studies as irrelevant due to supposed biases...This narrative was sustained and amplified by scientists, academics, and government agency staff,” with possibly the most egregious example being a notorious study published in The Lancet that the esteemed medical journal was forced to retract after the data sources turned out to be fraudulent.  “A Google News search for the words ‘unproven’ and ‘hydroxychloroquine’ in reports published in April and May returned over 160 results, with most of these articles managing to work the adjective into headlines or opening sentences,” the paper goes on. “None of these reports mentioned that observational trials had discovered useful drugs in the past. Nor did they clarify that many observational studies in aggregate can yield more meaningful results than any one single study, RCTs included.”  Last month, three Republican senators sent a letter to U.S. Food & Drug Administration FDA Commissioner Alex Azar this month demanding an explanation as to why the agency revoked its approval of HCQ against the wishes of American doctors and the experiences of other countries.  LifeSiteNews’ petition calling on the FDA to drop its hostility to hydroxychloroquine has so far collected more than 49,000 signatures.

Louie Gohmert told Chris Salcedo on Newsmax that people on the ground in Germany report that Scytl, which hosted elections data improperly through Spain, was raided by a large US ARMY force and their servers were seized in Frankfurt.

From our source: The US government, once they determined that this Dominion server was involved in switching votes, then the intelligence community began a search for the server and discovered that the server was in Germany. In order to get access to that server and have it available for use in a legal manner they had to have the State Department work in tandem with the Department of Justice. They had to request that the government of Germany cooperate in allowing this seizure of this server. The appropriate documents required to affect that kind of seizure were put in place, signed off on, and it appears there was also US military support in this operation. The US military was not in the lead. But this helps explain why Esper was fired and Miller and Kash Patel were put in place — so that the military would not interfere with the operation in any way. By getting ahold of the server they now are going to have the direct evidence of when they were instructed to stop counting. They will also discover who gave the direction to stop counting and who initiated the algorithm that started switching votes. The CIA was completely excluded from this operation.

bb1342bc,"People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed.  As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition.  They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme.  Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&E, the report says.  More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early.  Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year.  “People diagnosed in A&E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group.  It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London.  GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed.  However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.”  Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people.  NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester 56.1% and Leeds south and east 54%.  More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland.  In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire 15.7% and Harrogate 16%.  Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&E.  Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks.  The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.”  Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added.  NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival.","Late diagnosis of lung cancer hitting survival rate, study says",FALSE
a92a5031,"Comprehensive Plan Includes Proposals to Restart our Local Economies, Rethink How New York State Operates, and Renew our Commitment to Residents  As the Legislative session is set to begin this week, Senate Republican Leader Robert Ortt and members of the Republican Conference today unveiled a comprehensive vision to Reset New York.  The plan includes several components to address mounting economic and fiscal challenges facing the State -- many of which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic -- and to help forge a better path forward for all New Yorkers.  “Under New York’s one-party control, we have seen a dramatic and unwelcome shift in our state’s priorities. Democrats displayed no interest in rebuilding our local economy, lessening the financial burden on our middle class, or stemming the ever-increasing outflow of New York residents fleeing our state. They sought to release dangerous criminals into our communities, undermine our law enforcement, and waste millions of dollars on progressive agenda items. The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the need for immediate action on the unresolved challenges facing our small business community and New York’s hardworking taxpayers,” said Senate Republican Leader Robert Ortt.  The Senate Republicans’ plan includes proposals that prioritize restarting our local economies, rethinking how New York State operates, and renewing a commitment to New York State’s residents to ensure strong, robust communities.  Restart our Local Economies by:  · Safely reopening our small businesses to help them get back on their feet and offer gainful employment for residents;  · Helping our schools and colleges stay open; and  · Investing in our physical and human infrastructure to rebuild our state’s competitiveness.  Rethink how New York State Operates by:  · Ending New York State’s unaffordability problem, which has been made worse by the pandemic;  · Taking on State government’s culture of overspending and restoring fiscal responsibility; and  · Reasserting the Legislature’s constitutional authority as an equal branch of government.  Renew our Commitment to Residents by:  · Fostering the growth of vibrant local communities;  · Developing a robust economy with diverse opportunities; and  · Creating safer neighborhoods with common sense public safety measures.  “New York government is failing its people. Broken policies have made New York more expensive, less safe and have diminished the quality of life for our residents. We need to change course before it is too late,” said Deputy Leader Andrew Lanza.  “Throughout this pandemic, there seems to have been little interest from New York’s one-party leadership in stepping up and taking an active legislative role in constructively combating the pandemic by putting our communities’ safety and livelihoods at the forefront of legislative policy. I’m proud to join my colleagues in offering actual solutions to help us rise to meet the challenges ahead. I call on my colleagues across the political spectrum to join us as we work toward ending this terrible crisis and rebuilding our state for the better,” said Senator Fred Akshar.  “While New York State once stood tall in our nation as a pillar of economic strength, educational excellence and public policy innovation, its leadership today is more dubious. High taxes, excessive, job-killing regulations, and a rising crime rate have made us number one in population loss, and a misguided focus on politically driven agendas has diverted precious resources away from our core responsibilities. With the added challenges created by the pandemic, the future of our state hangs in the balance. If there was ever a compelling case to rethink and change course, this is it,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Long before the COVID-19 pandemic turned our world upside down, New York faced daunting challenges, including a looming budget deficit and a shrinking population. The corona virus has exacerbated our problems, adding to the financial burden we face and bringing our economy and many small businesses to the brink. As we fight the pandemic, we must also safely re-open our economy, control spending, ease the burden on taxpayers and restore our system of checks and balances in state government,” said Senator Patrick M. Gallivan.  “We have seen an exodus of New York residents, families and businesses who have fled the state for better opportunities elsewhere because of unwelcome policies, burdensome regulations and high taxes. Substantive and dramatic change is needed, especially at a time when the state’s fiscal challenges have been significantly exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. This plan refocuses the state’s priorities and helps to build a better and brighter future for New York,” said Senator Joseph Griffo.  “Together we can restore New York to its rightful status as the Empire State. To accomplish this we must work with our small business owners, farmers and other job creators. My focus is on getting New York open for business and helping people get back to work safely. This common sense package would help the communities I represent and put our state on the road to real economic recovery and future prosperity,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “Overcoming the unprecedented, ongoing health, economic, and community challenges posed by COVID-19 requires big, bold solutions. We need to rethink the state’s approach to solving problems, successfully restart our economy, and renew our commitment to residents and each other. Partisan politics and a bureaucratic Albany trapped in the old ways of doing things won’t work. What will work is advancing smarter public policies that recognize the breadth and depth of our challenges and the necessity of fresh thinking that goes beyond party labels. It’s time for our state to hit the reset button, and it begins with the priorities and principles we are unveiling today. Our Reset New York State plan reflects our continued efforts to bring New Yorkers together and improve the quality of life across our state. We are ready to answer the challenges of COVID and deliver the positive change New Yorkers expect and rightfully deserve,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “Between July 2019 and July 2020, New York State led the nation in at least one thing- people moving out. The pandemic only accelerated a trend that was already in place. High taxes and an unfriendly business climate are the real culprits. Our small businesses need help and our state needs a new direction. We already know what works from other states that are growing and not shrinking. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, instead we need a reset. Senate Republicans have a plan to do just that and I'm proud to support it,” said Senator Michael Martucci.  “As our state begins to emerge from the current crisis, it is vital that we start immediately working together to make our state’s future brighter than the past. The ‘Reset New York’ plan reflects the priorities of hardworking New Yorkers and I am proud to join with my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference to make sure their voices are heard in Albany. The challenges our state faces are not new but the solutions must be – and finding them must be our main focus,” said Senator Mario Mattera.  “I look forward throughout this new legislative session to our Senate Republican Conference giving voice to the need for rebuilding local economies, focusing on stronger and safer communities, and resisting what threatens to be a devastating expansion of a business-as-usual, tax-and-spend direction in state government. This ‘Reset New York’ strategy begins our commitment to more fiscally responsible, commonsense government that works better for taxpayers, builds and protects livelihoods, honors public safety and security, and focuses like never before on the restoration of Upstate’s rightful place in New York government,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “New York is facing true challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic is one reason for our struggles, but wayward state policies that fail to meet the needs of our small businesses, families, and taxpayers, are the real culprit. There is no margin for error and the time is now to change course by enacting the Reset New York agenda. Specifically, broadband access, support for our farmers, and a strong educational system are among the initial building blocks that can set us on the right path. Let’s enact policies that create opportunities, not those that confine us,” said Senator Peter Oberacker.  “Long Island’s families, businesses and seniors are hurting and need greater support and relief from state government, both in the immediate term to help get through the pandemic and in the future to ensure that New York is a more affordable and safer place to call home. Reset New York will put us on a trajectory to accomplish these goals and begin to reverse the trends of higher taxes, burdensome regulations, and more crime that has caused hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the Empire State,” said Senator Anthony Palumbo.  “New York is in desperate need of a reset. The pandemic has highlighted and exasperated the issues that our state has faced for decades. We continue to lose residents and jobs, with our high taxes and over regulations. Our communities are suffering. Small businesses, restaurants and family farms are struggling to stay afloat. We need to provide real answers and solutions to help our local economies and save our struggling communities. We can no longer ignore these glaring issues. New Yorkers need results now,” said Senator Ed Rath.  “In recent years, people have been fleeing New York State due to high taxes, a lack of opportunity, and red tape that hinders business growth. The pandemic has only made matters worse and now, more than ever, our state needs a reset. From reenergizing our small businesses to making New York more affordable for hardworking taxpayers, my colleagues and I are committed to fighting for changes that will improve our state in the wake of this unprecedented pandemic,” said Senator Patty Ritchie.  “Despite the unprecedented challenges that our communities are facing, New Yorkers have remained resilient, and now more than ever, they need a government determined to deliver results. If we want to rebuild our state, we have to start by resetting the state's priorities and ensuring that the needs of hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers are firmly at the top. I am proud to join with my colleagues to reaffirm our commitment to that goal and to do all that we can to ensure that small businesses, middle class families, and struggling New Yorkers have a strong, independent voice on their side,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “There’s only one way forward and that’s to enable our businesses and communities, big and small, to have the best possible chance to recover. When the need for help is apparent, too often the response of government is to throw an anvil instead of a life-preserver into the water. We can’t make this harder with higher taxes and more unreasonable demands. Our vision must show that we are listening. That’s what this is about,” said Senator Dan Stec.  “As we begin a New Year and new legislative session, our top priority must continue to be addressing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic so we can stop the spread of the virus, save lives and safely reopen our economy. In order to reset New York State by safely restarting our economy, we need to address the elephant in the room that our state government is not talking about: the fact that for the third year in a row, New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade. When enough people who can afford to leave New York State are gone, who will be left to pay for the infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities? I look forward to joining with Leader Ortt and my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference in the coming weeks and months to address these issues and put forth policies to turn things around so the Empire State does not become the ‘Empty State,’” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “I look forward to joining my Senate Republican Conference colleagues in advancing our ambitious Reset New York plan today. As we all work toward opening our State and local communities safely from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus must be on the economy, which starts with advancing policies that support small businesses, which are the backbones of our communities, jobs, public safety, improving our local infrastructure, and ensuring our schools get their fair share. One party control has pushed those priorities to the side and with our Reset New York plan, our Conference will ensure that the voices of our constituents are heard,” said Senator Alexis Weik.  ###",Senate Republican Leader Ortt And Republican Conference Announce Plan to “Reset New York State”,partially false
eaf36480,"SHARE  By of the  Republican state Rep. Jeff Stone of Greendale formally announced his bid to succeed Scott Walker as Milwaukee County executive Wednesday, saying he'd adhere closely to Walker's formula - keeping a tight lid on taxes, pushing for worker concessions and promoting job development.  Meanwhile Wednesday, Walker announced he will step down as county executive Dec. 27. That ensures that the special elections for his replacement can be held concurrent with spring elections - Feb. 15 for a primary, if needed, and April 5 for the runoff - and avoid costs of a separate election.  Serving the residents of Milwaukee County for the last eight years has been an honor, Walker said in the statement.  Stone joins what could become a crowded field, with several other legislators, county supervisors and even former county executive Tom Ament pondering a run for the remaining year of Walker's term as county executive. Stone, however, becomes the first of the higher-profile prospects to announce he'll run and is the only Republican office holder among a lengthening list of possible candidates for the nonpartisan job.  We need to look at all options to keep our county financially viable - any option except raising taxes, Stone said from his newly opened campaign office in Wauwatosa. He stressed the importance of private-sector solutions to problems in the local economy and said job creation would go a long way toward improving the county's financial condition.  Stone, 49, said he'd be a vital link for the county with Walker in the governor's office and Republicans who will run both houses of the Legislature next year. He praised Walker's tenure as county executive and noted he once carpooled to the Capitol with Walker when they served together in the Assembly.  He differs from Walker in having a background steeped in business, said Stone, who has run a printing business for 27 years. Stone said Walker's era as county executive began with a focus of reforming government, while his emphasis will be on expanding the economy.  Stone made a pitch for harmony with the County Board, which has frequently sparred with Walker. Stone also said he'd enlist the help of the local business community and others.  Though he spoke mostly in generalities, Stone said he wanted to develop a long-range plan for restoring the county to fiscal health.  His announcement drew criticism from Mike Tate, the state Democratic Party chairman, who said Stone would continue Walker policies and result in deeper financial problems. He said the party would spend thousands to help a Democratic or progressive candidate defeat Stone.  Stone said he expects to have to raise $800,000 or more to run a successful race. His campaign account now has a balance of nearly $13,000, state records show.  The lineup of potential candidates includes former Democratic state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, County Supervisors Johnny Thomas and Marina Dimitrijevic, County Clerk Joe Czarnezki, County Treasurer Dan Diliberti and Ament.  Holloway will temporarily succeed Walker as county executive but must appoint an interim executive within 30 days.

Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Conspiracists are bizarrely claiming the UK could be hit harder by coronavirus because of the rollout of the 5G network, a claim that has been dismissed by scientists.  Currently there are 3,983 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Britain and Northern Ireland.  As coronavirus has ripped across the globe, a new conspiracy theory has found an eager audience: that the symptoms of the virus - high fever, coughing and shortness of breath - are actually the human body responding to exposure to 5G.  The theory has been shot down by experts, who have pointed out that coronavirus cases have been identified in many areas with no 5G networks.  Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto  Anti-5G critics based in the UK accept the virus likely began in a market in Wuhan and travelled here through human transmission. But they bizarrely believe the 5G networks helps the spread of the virus.  But they're concerned the ultra-fast network currently operating in almost 100 locations around Britain could be helping it to spread more quickly, despite a lack of scientific proof to stand up their unfounded claims.  Activist Louise Thomas, based in Somerset, told Daily Star Online: We can't say 5G has caused the coronavirus, but it might be exacerbating it.  Tanja Rebel, another activist and philosophy lecturer at the Isle of Wight College, told us: Many studies show that Electro-Magnetic Radiation EMR suppresses the immune system and that it helps viruses and bacteria thrive.  So EMR and in particular 5G could act as an accelerator for the disease. We do not know for sure, but common sense and the precautionary principle decree that we urgently need a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until we can show that it is safe.  Public Health England PHE has publicly stated there is no convincing evidence that exposure to radiation at a level below the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation guidelines will cause adverse health effects.  That safe level is 300GHz, while the level of radiation from 5G will likely only be as high as the tens of GHz.  PHE has been approached for comment on these specific claims from activists.  The new 5G network is being rolled out incrementally across the UK  The “precautionary principle” says that governments and societies should react with caution to anything with the potential to cause catastrophic damage which is not yet well-understood by science.  Italy, now the country with the highest coronavirus death toll, had 5G networks installed in five cities in 2019 with plans to extend coverage throughout 2020. However Iran, which has also been badly affected by the pandemic, has no 5G networks at all, disputing this theory.  A 2011 study from Northeastern University in Boston indicated that some single-celled bacteria, such as E.coli, may communicate with each other using radio waves.  Very little is known about Covid-19, the novel coronavirus at the heart of the current pandemic, but research has shown that viruses talk to each other when making decisions about infecting a host.  Activists are now calling for the government to put a stop to the 5G rollout in what they believe to be the interests of public health, despite repeated assurances from experts that the network radiation poses no threat.  Especially in today's situation it is paramount that we do not play further with lives, Rebel said. Anything else would be deeply reckless.  There have been reports of 5G masts being vandalised and telecoms engineers harassed by member of the public who believe the coronavirus conspiracy theory.  Communications regulator Ofcom has warned this behaviour poses a serious threat to people's safety, adding: We would like to emphasise that there is no relationship whatsoever between 5G mobile signals and the coronavirus.  Vandalism to mobile phone masts mean other services using those masts stop working. These services could include 3G, 4G and mobile call services.  This means people can't call the emergency services or contact their family. It could also mean that some of the communications equipment used by the emergency services is unable to work properly.

83f8a888,"Democrat spokesperson, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, continues to push her socialist agenda and now it’s getting downright scary. Her latest genius plan is to socialize our children. That’s right, apparently AOC feels that upon birth, the offspring of American families should be taken from their homes to be raised by the state “so that they can do properly indoctrinated and become model citizens for a new and better American future.”  This is straight out of the Soviet playbook where children were routinely removed from households and molded into various roles for government. They were treated as possessions, not people, while families mourned.  AOC suggested this when asked her thoughts on the plight of orphaned children throughout the country, currently at 50 year high.  “Our children are underused in this country. Or rather, improperly used. They say children are the future. That is absolutely right. They hold the promise to shape the future of our nation. This can be positive or negative. Orphans are in the right place. Government can begin their training early. All kids should go to government. By staying with family, children are fed varieties of information. There’s no consistency from one household to the next. This is counterproductive to the societal good. In order to further the interests of the country and all it’s citizens, there needs to be common learning amongst all of the young. Child rearing taken over by the state can accomplish this while also providing a safe and healthy environment in which to grow. Surrendering your children to the state is really the highest form of patriotism there can be. It shows you love our country and are committed to building its success for generations to come.”  If another reason was ever needed to join the fight against socialism, this is it.

Liberals along with Black Lives Matter have started a petition that has over 25 million signatures to change the name of the White House to The People’s House, stating that “White” is oppressive and racist.  The White House has been named the White House since 1901 when Theodore Roosevelt named it that during his presidency. The change is being demanded after weeks of racial strife and protests across the United States.  The petition, which started last week, already has enough signatures to be forwarded to the White House and if it reaches 100 million it can become law!!! We must stop these hoodlums!!!  The liberals have been doing everything that they can to remove anything that they consider to be racist or offensive. Like the confederate flag, or nooses, or other symbols of actual racism that most trump supporters think are good and wholesome.  Like Trump himself, who really is a racist piece of trash. Joe Barron, who was one of the first to sign the petition says it really is the “People’s House,” even though that big fat windbag currently occupies it.  These liberal leftists will stop at nothing to try and dismantle the racist history they say this nation was founded on. No matter what it is, they want it down, and it looks like they’re getting what they want. And conservatives across the country are none too happy about it.  They reminisce of a time where being openly racist was ok and the norm and thought that with the election of Trump, we’d be going back to that.  Well, they were wrong.

4684f622,"Introduction  Many conservatives have been confused by John Roberts’ decisions as Chief Justice of SCOTUS. On decision after decision, he has followed the line of thinking common to the radical left. Yes, we have Kavanaugh, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, and now ACB on our side and that is great. But Roberts was appointed by Bush. He was supposed to be a conservative justice. Why has he not acted like it, especially recently? One potential reason is that it might be true that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  Now, I’m not a conspiracy theorist. Yes, I’m concerned about the brazen voter fraud in the election, especially the votes Biden received from non-citizens. Yes, I think the Hunter Biden emails are real and I think Biden might have worn a wire during the first debate. And no, I don’t think Epstein killed himself. But, other than the wire, those aren’t really conspiracy theories. They are things that happened. I think the same is true of me saying that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island. I might be wrong, but the evidence is damning.      Think your mask is completely useless, just like John Roberts? Mad at your governor’s Covid policies?

Become one here: Patreon Donation Link  What We Know: It Sure Looks Like Justice John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island and Might Have Been or Still Could Be Blackmailed  For those that have been living under a rock, it came to light a few years ago that Jeffrey Epstein had an island in the Caribbean where he took elites to have sex with children. Various famous and prominent men, namely Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, visited frequently. Hollywood elites, such as Kevin Spacey, also visited.  The main theory about that island and Epstein’s wealth is that, in addition to just being a sick and twisted individual, Epstein blackmailed the people he brought to the island. Perhaps he did that for money, perhaps for fame, or perhaps for power. The “why” isn’t known yet and probably won’t be until Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial.  But what we do know is that Epstein brought famous and influential individuals to his island and had ample evidence with which he could blackmail them. One of those individuals might have been Chief Justice Roberts; it does look like Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and could have been blackmailed to make bad SCOTUS decisions. Here’s the evidence.  Piece of Evidence #1: The Flight Log  To determine who visited “pedo island,” one key piece of evidence has been the flight log. For example, a flight log from 2009 showed that Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Naomi Campbell visited the island. You might remember that Kevin Spacey was accused of harassing a minor and there is ample evidence that Clinton and Prince Andrew also had inappropriate relations with minors.  Now, one interesting name on that list is a John Roberts. Here is what Lin Wood had to say about the idea that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and was on the flight manifest:  Additionally, there is this image of the flight log. If you view the circled area, you will see that a “John Roberts” signed it:  Now, there are, of course, potential refutations of that. Just because Lin Wood said so and there appears to be a flight log that shows so does not mean that Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  For one, the image could be faked. I completely understand that and want everyone else to too. I don’t have a copy of the flight log, so I can’t independently confirm it. However, the image does appear to be real and has not, to my knowledge, been discredited as of yet.  The other believable refutation is that the “John Roberts” listed is not the Chief Justice of SCOTUS. Both “John” and “Roberts” are common first and last names, so there could be another that was on the so-called Lolita Express.  But Epstein didn’t mingle with normal people. He only brought the elite of the elite to his island, and Chief Justice John Roberts is undoubtedly the most famous and influential “John Roberts” out there. Given the record of who Epstein brought to the island, it is likely, if the image is real and Lin Woods is right, that the John Roberts in Epstein’s flight log is Chief Justice John Roberts.  Piece of Evidence #2: Tapes and Pictures Appear to Show that John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island  According to one whistleblower about the heinous crimes of Epstein and his guests, Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and can be seen in the Epstein tapes. Here is what one site, Penns Word, had to say:  “A whistleblower who allegedly works in the federal circuit revealed a Supreme Court justice was seen in various “Epstein tapes” that were recently recovered by investigators: “One of the SCOTUS [justices] is in the Epstein tapes that were recovered yesterday. I’m sure you can guess which one. “The shocking part is the canary is telling the feds a certain nation state has been blackmailing this gentleman since prior to his nomination to SCOTUS. “What does this mean? This justice was hand picked at the highest levels specifically because he was being controlled via blackmail. A sheep in wolf’s clothing appearing to be which he is not. “Cat is out of the bag… or I should say almost.”’ From: https://www.pennswordtwo.com/article/did-supreme-court-justice-john-roberts-just-get-fileted-by-the-epstein-tapes.html  Perhaps that whistleblower is lying. Or, perhaps, they’re telling the truth and John Roberts did appear at Epstein’s island. Lending credence to that view is an image that has leaked from those tapes. Here it is the others who are allegedly in the photo are, from left to right, Richard Cheaz, Bill Clinton, George Nader, and Tony Podesta:  This image is the clearest piece of evidence that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island  For reference, here is a picture of John Roberts from his swearing in that presents a similar profile:  Swearing in of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  Again, the image could be fake. Someone could have photoshopped John Roberts into the image. Or, it could be a real image with someone other than Chief Justice John Roberts in it. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Other than the haircut, the profile appears to be about the same. The nose, in particular, is strikingly similar, as is the general shape and profile of the face.  So, based on the whistleblower’s testimony and a leaked image, it does look like John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  Conclusion: It Sure Looks Like John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island  When the flight log, whistleblower testimony, and leaked image are all viewed, it is hard to not reach the conclusion that Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island. Personally, I think the evidence is convincing, although I recognize that the images could be fake and the testimony made up.  But, if real, it would point to why John Roberts has made the decisions he has made since appointed. He has avoided contentious issues when possible because of blackmail or because he fears being in a situation where he could be blackmailed. When it came down to how to vote, he voted to the left because that’s what whoever blackmailed him told him to do. In short, it would appear that John Roberts is compromised and can’t be trusted to enforce constitutionality. He’ll just keep doing what his handlers tell him to do.

643feac4,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marco Rubio R-FL and Jim Risch R-ID issued the following statement regarding the impending declassification of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence release of a partisan report on CIA interrogation and detention programs:  “The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. tax-payers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official.  “It is unconscionable that the Committee and the White House would support releasing this report despite warnings from our allies, the U.S. State Department, and a new coordinated Intelligence Community document assessing the increased risk to the United States the release of this report poses. We are concerned that this release could endanger the lives of Americans overseas, jeopardize U.S. relations with foreign partners, potentially incite violence, create political problems for our allies, and be used as a recruitment tool for our enemies. Simply put, this release is reckless and irresponsible. We have written to the administration reminding them of these concerns.  “Congress has a legitimate and necessary role to play in conducting serious and constructive oversight of our intelligence agencies and capabilities. This report does not qualify as either serious or constructive. This was a partisan effort that divided members of the committee, and the committee against the people of the CIA. We voted against this report because it is flawed, and voted against declassifying this report because we believed that its release could put American lives at risk, be used to contribute to propaganda against the United States by our enemies, and damage U.S. foreign policy and counterterrorism efforts.  “The American civilian and uniformed personnel who worked tirelessly in the days and months after the September 11, 2001 attacks on our nation to keep us safe and prevent another mass casualty event deserve our eternal gratitude, not politically–motivated attacks. As a nation at war, we need a coherent detention and interrogation policy in order to extract valuable intelligence about terrorist networks from captured operatives.

d1db1b6c,"Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering a temporary six-week ban on the sale of combustible cigarettes in order to reduce the State’s Coronavirus death count, a source familiar with his thinking tells The Chronicle. The ban could come as soon as Monday and is expected to be included in a budget measure already scheduled to be announced.  New data out of Italy suggest that the nation’s whopping Coronavirus death rate — now approaching 10% of those who test positive — is highly correlated to cigarette use. Italian men smoke cigarettes at rates that far outpace most other developed countries, and the extreme shortage of ventilators there has been the cause of death for tens of thousands of smokers.  According to Italy’s National Health Institute, smokers with COVID-19 were one-third more likely to have a serious clinical situation than non-smokers. Half of these smokers required a ventilator.  For many weeks, it was observed that women in Italy are better able to overcome the virus than men. Italian doctors now believe that the statistical difference is attributable to smoking-related gender norms.  COVID-19 kills its victims by compromising the respiratory system and reducing oxygen levels in the blood. Regular cigarette use damages the airways and small air sacs in the lungs. Combustible cigarettes weaken smokers’ lungs by filling them with smoke and tar.  “When a smoker contracts COVID-19, he or she will be far more likely to suffer respiratory system failure, thereby exacerbating New York’s ventilator shortage,” Cuomo plans to say in remarks prepared for Monday. “Fortunately, medical science informs us that ex-smokers experience significant recovery in lung function and oxygen absorption as soon as they quit smoking.”  Former smokers recover 30% of their lung function just two weeks after quitting.  “Any ex-smoker can tell you how, just days after quitting, they were noticeably less out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs. Personally, I have heard hundreds of these stories,” he writes in draft remarks.  Dr. Howard Zucker, the Commissioner of Health, is prodding Cuomo to issue the temporary ban and discussed the issue with him privately earlier this week. Zucker has long advocated for additional restrictions on combustible cigarette sales, which causes more than 443,000 deaths annually — more deaths each year than from murder, car accidents, alcohol or drug use, suicides, and HIV combined.  It’s estimated that 81,000 people will die from COVID-19.  Zucker argues that a ban on cigarette sales for the duration of the outbreak will save thousands of lives and will reduce the State’s shortage of ventilators, perhaps by several thousand during its peak — expected to hit the State 21 days from today.  Therefore, the Governor’s advisors postulate, if New York takes immediate action and temporarily bans combustible cigarette sales during this public health crisis, ex-smokers’ respiratory systems will make significant recovery at the very same time that COVID-19 cases are peaking in New York.  “This will save lives, and not just the lives of smokers,” the Governor plans to say. “Every former smoker that gets sick, but does not need a ventilator, means one more ventilator is available to keep our aging parents and grandparents alive.”  “Importantly, we must also recognize that failing to temporarily ban combustible cigarettes immediately will cause a disproportionate increase in COVID-19 fatalities in minority communities, given the higher prevalence of immuno-deficiencies in these communities,” he plans to note.  The Governor’s supporters argue that it is more important now than ever to address the public health cost of combustible cigarettes — not just to save the lives of smokers, but to save the lives of all New Yorkers by mitigating the severity of a ventilator shortage.

98d4dc5a,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.  Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.  Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority approximately 73% of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.  When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”  According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.  Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.  According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.  Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",New Regulation Requires 75 MPH Governor On All Motorcycles,FALSE

9aaa3322,"SALEM -- During the three-day organizational session that ended Wednesday, the Oregon House and Senate introduced 1,623 bills and resolutions that run the gamut from the seriously serious to the seemingly silly.  Other bills  of interest  Here are some highlights of legislation introduced this week in Oregon's 2011 Legislature:  House Bill 2250:  Would require the State Parks and Recreation Commission to try for an agreement with Portland Parks and Recreation to acquire Forest Park.  House Bill 2749:  Would create offense of driving while drowsy.  House Bill 2140:  Would require anyone younger than 18 and living in Clackamas, Multnomah or Washington county to complete traffic safety education course before obtaining a provisional driver's license.  Senate Bill 4:  Would require school districts to ensure that physical education or recess time is available each school day for students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  Senate Bill 7:  Would create income tax credit for creation of new employment positions.  Senate Bill 130:  Would add green, yellow and red bicycle signals to list of traffic control devices.  Senate Bill 503:  Would suspend cost-of-living raises, filling of vacant positions and out-of-state travel for state government workers through June 30.  Lawmakers return Feb. 1 to begin the real work of slogging through legislation and plugging a $3.5 billion hole in the next budget. The bills that await them suggest Oregonians will hear much debate about taxes. It also appears that lawmakers are ready to take on public employee compensation and retirement and to consider fairly radical reforms to the state's K-12 public schools and universities.  Some measures introduced this week are repeats -- there are a few bills drafted every session for symbolic or political reasons, but they don't usually get a hearing. Among them this time:  , which would allow Oregonians to pump their own gas and  , which would designate English as the state's official language.  There are also a number of bills aimed at breaking questionable habits. For example,  would make it illegal to carry a child younger than 6 on a bicycle or in a bicycle trailer.  proposes a $90 fine for those who drive with an animal on their lap.  Got your attention? Here's a look at other pending action:  Of border collies and classical music  Every session, there are bills that seem cute and easy, but spark a big fight.  This year's nominee is  , which would designate the border collie as the state dog.  After criticizing a bill last session that named the Dungeness crab the official state crustacean,  R-John Day, admitted he's feeling kind of sheepish about introducing his border collie bill.  A constituent asked him to submit the measure, Ferrioli said, noting that even he thinks the chances are slim.  How, he asked, do you convince the dachshund owners that the border collie should be the state dog?  And then there are measures that appear frivolous, until they're explained.  would require TriMet to broadcast classical music at MAX light-rail stations in high-crime areas.  We shouldn't let the fear of looking silly get in the way of a good idea, said Rep.  a Portland Democrat and the bill's sponsor.  Piped-in classical music has helped reduce robberies, drug calls and vandalism in Florida, London and Tokyo, Smith said.  Here in Oregon, he said, a test last month at the MAX station at 162nd Avenue and Burnside saw crime down 41 percent compared with December 2009.  MAX safety is a big issue in my district, Smith said. We don't have any money for anything and this is, perhaps, the most cost-effective safety idea in the world.  It's your money  Former Gov. Ted Kulongoski urged legislators to change the kicker tax law last year, but they didn't want to go there -- especially with an election coming up. But Sen.  , a Portland Democrat and chair of the Senate Finance and Revenue Committee said the 2011 Legislature must commit to kicker reform.  There are a number of kicker bills. Some propose to divert any income above the state's expected forecasted revenue into a reserve account rather than returning it to taxpayers. Others would keep all or part of the kicker for individual taxpayers but funnel the corporate kicker into state savings.  Lawmakers also may revisit Measure 67, a controversial proposal raising the state's corporate minimum tax. It passed during the 2009 Legislature and was endorsed by voters last January but has continued to leave a sour taste in the business community.  proposes an alternative method of assessing the corporate minimum while  would repeal Measure 67 outright.  Schools: Raising the grade  A number of bills take direct aim at improving public school performance. Among the most dramatic is  , which would prohibit schools from allowing a student to leave third grade if he is not reading at or above a third-grade reading level.  You want to intervene on problems early and get them taken care of rather than shuffling students along, said  , a Wilsonville Republican who was named co-chair of the House Education Committee this week.

Twin bills,  and  , designate the governor as the state's superintendent of public instruction as opposed to the separately elected state superintendent of schools.  , a Eugene Democrat and legislation sponsor, says the ultimate responsibility for Oregon's schools ought to rest with the top elected leader.

cbb6ee95,"Equally troubling was the more recent discovery by Tom Fitz, a geology professor at Northland College in Ashland, Wis., of a highly carcinogenic asbestos-form mineral at one of GTac’s sampling sites. The fibers of the mineral, which would be dispersed in blasting, are like tiny, breathable needles.  Last September, several hundred people gathered outside John F. Kennedy Memorial Airport in Ashland, a few miles from GTac’s mining site, to commemorate Kennedy’s 1963 speech, which called for legislation to protect the area’s natural resources and promoted its economic potential as a scenic region for recreation. One of the last to speak at the event was Mike Wiggins Jr., the chairman of the Bad River tribe and the mine’s most formidable opponent.  The Bad River fear the contamination of the fish they depend on for food and the destruction of sensitive wild rice beds that they harvest on the coast of Lake Superior. Mr. Wiggins has voiced his opposition to the mining legislation in private meetings with Mr. Walker, led Wisconsin’s tribes in demonstrations at the State Capitol in Madison and allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the Bad River tribe’s scant resources to legal fees to fight the mine.  The Bad River and several other tribes assert that the state has no right to permit the enormous mine without their agreement since the site lies in “ceded territory,” an area covering a large portion of Northern Wisconsin where tribal members maintain special hunting, fishing and harvesting rights enshrined in federal treaties. Last June, one of the tribes established an educational camp near the mining site to draw attention to how the mine would violate its treaty rights, as well as to highlight sustainable alternatives to mining. GTac responded to a minor altercation with protesters unconnected to the camp by hiring an Arizona-based private-security firm, which sent guards armed with semiautomatic weapons to patrol the mine site. The guards have since been withdrawn; the camp is still there.  In the Chippewa tradition, a decision is made based on how it will affect people seven generations forward. By contrast, the company’s optimistic estimate for the life span of the first phase of the mine is 35 years. Last summer Mr. Wiggins played Governor Walker a recording of Kennedy’s speech. Mr. Wiggins said that the governor appeared indifferent to Kennedy’s words; Mr. Walker has never wavered in his support of the mine.  Though GTac has already begun bulk sampling iron ore at the site, the mine still faces many hurdles before it can be permitted. The company has filed incomplete sampling applications with the state’s Department of Natural Resources. GTac’s president, Bill Williams, is facing a criminal inquiry in Spain for alleged environmental crimes, which are unrelated to the GTac mine. The charges state that runoff from an open-pit mine where he once worked as an executive contaminated local groundwater. Mr. Williams denies the charges and declined to comment on them. Most important, the tribes will almost certainly challenge the mine in federal court.  Mr. Wiggins and five other tribal leaders have already begun seeking redress from the federal government. Last August, they sent President Obama a letter asking him to direct the Interior Department to prevent the construction of GTac’s mine, citing their claims that the mine would infringe on their treaty rights.  Though the letter did not mention it, five years ago Mr. Obama told nearly 400 Native American tribal leaders, “We have a lot to learn from your nations in order to create the kind of sustainability in our environment that we so desperately need.” The president said that the tribes “deserve to have a voice” and “will not be forgotten as long as I’m in this White House.” Last week, Mr. Wiggins said that although he has gotten preliminary responses from two federal agencies, he is still awaiting an answer from the president.",The Fight for Wisconsin’s Soul - The New York Times,partially false
28a5ba2e,"The proportion of people living in poverty who are in a working family has hit a record high, according to a report that shows rising levels of employment have failed to translate into higher living standards.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that while paid employment reduces the risk of poverty, about 56% of people living in poverty in 2018 were in a household where at least one person had a job, compared with 39% 20 years ago.  Seven in 10 children in poverty are now in a working family, the charity’s annual UK poverty report found.  Single-parent families have been the worst affected by the trend of wages falling behind living costs, it added. Working single parents accounted for three in 10 households in poverty in 2018, compared with two in 10 in 2011.  The JRF’s executive director, Claire Ainsley, said the charity’s latest barometer of poverty in the UK revealed the scale of the task facing Boris Johnson’s administration if it is to “level up” incomes across the UK by narrowing the gap between the wealthiest cities and poorer regions.  “The new government has a historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s,” she said. “Past successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel, and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.”  Amid concerns that the poorest receive worse healthcare and have the most insecure jobs, Ainsley said it was an indictment of recent government policy that the number of people in poverty across the whole workforce jumped from 9.9% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2018.  Labour accused the government of allowing too many people to remain trapped in low-paid insecure work and “all too often the social security system fails to give people the support they need”.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs. Zero-hour contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least £10 an hour right away.”  Approximately 14 million people are in poverty in the UK – more than one in five of the population, including 4 million children and 2 million pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years.  A family is classified as being in poverty if it has an income of less than 60% of the median income for their family type, after housing costs. A family’s income includes earnings from employment, self-employment, state benefits and inheritances.  The report said people were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.  The worst-hit regions were London, the north of England, the Midlands and Wales, while the lowest poverty rates were found in the south of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the JRF said.  The charity was especially concerned about the rise in young people living with their parents, who in a previous era would have started to buy a house and start a family of their own, which it named “concealed households”.  Twenty years ago, 20% 2.4 million of 20- to 34-year-olds lived with a parent or guardian. That proportion rose to 30% in 2018, affecting 3.9 million people, the JRF found.  The report describes in-work poverty as a “critical issue for our economy” and calls for action to reduce job insecurity, lower housing costs and increase earnings for low-paid workers.  The JRF said the introduction of universal credit, which rolls six benefits into one, did not help many low-income families because it required upfront payments for childcare before households were able to access state support.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. We know that getting into work is the best route out of poverty – and there are more people in work than ever before. Wages are outstripping inflation and absolute poverty is lower than in 2010.  “We know that some need more help, which is why we spend over £95bn a year on working-age benefits. Millions will see their benefit payments rise further from April and we’re also boosting the incomes of pensioners each year through the triple lock.”",Number of people in poverty in working families hits record high,FALSE

Cards and gifts will have been exchanged as dads all over the UK enjoyed family time.  But this isn't the full picture. New research commissioned by Fathers 4 Justice actually goes some way to shattering the Hallmark image of Father's Day .  The ComRes survey showed that out of more than 1000 fathers, 37 per cent said they, or someone they know, have experienced not seeing their children on Father’s Day.  When applied to the general population of the UK, that number equates to 2.3 million dads.  Image: Getty  The focus of the survey was on men with children aged 18 and under.  It showed the sometimes distressing realities of modern-day fatherhood, as one in five fathers, 20 per cent feared losing, or had lost contact with their children, and 22 per cent knew someone who had experienced this.  One third 32 per cent had experienced, or knew someone who had experienced, distress or mental health issues after being denied access to their children.  Image: Getty  Matt O'Connor, the founder of Fathers 4 Justice told the Telegraph: These figures, lay bare the appalling scale and reality of the challenges dads face on a daily basis. Denial of access to their children, estrangement and mental health problems for millions of men has become the norm.  The campaign also seeks to have a dedicated political representative for men and boys, mirroring the role of Women's minister.  Furthermore, the campaign is pushing for a fully funded 'safety net', which would tackle the alarmingly high rates of male suicide, depression and other health issues linked to family breakdown.  Image: PA  The ComRes poll found that nearly one in six dads, 17 per cent had experienced challenges accessing their children, while a quarter 27 per cent knew someone who had.

90feecf1,"The shocking reason why Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C ... because it contains experimental nanotech components that have NEVER been used in vaccines before  Lipid nanoparticles cause hyperinflammatory responses in the body, leading to severe reactions, hospitalization and potentially DEATH  UK government prepared for a vaccine death wave  Coronavirus vaccine deaths will be categorized as covid-19 deaths to keep the scam going  You're seeing the reports all over the news: Pfizer's new coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C -94F, which is much colder than the North Pole. If it's not stored at this temperature, its ingredients begin to break down and it fails to work. Currently Pfizer is claiming, without evidence, that its vaccine is 90% effective. But this claim is little more than corporate propaganda designed to drive up stock prices through false projections. But why do these vaccines need to be kept at -70C in the first place? The answer, it turns out, is because. As Children's Health Defense explained in an August 6th article , mRNA vaccines undergoing Covid-19 clinical trials, including the Moderna vaccine, rely on a nanoparticle-based “carrier system” containing a synthetic chemical called polyethylene glycol PEG. CHD goes on to explain: The use of PEG in drugs and vaccines is increasingly controversial due to the well-documented incidence of adverse PEG-related immune reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. Roughly seven in ten Americans may already be sensitized to PEG, which may result in reduced efficacy of the vaccine and an increase in adverse side effects. If a PEG-containing mRNA vaccine for Covid-19 gains FDA approval, the uptick in exposure to PEG will be unprecedented—and potentially disastrous. Moderna documents and publications indicate that the company is well aware of safety risks associated with PEG and other aspects of its mRNA technology but is more concerned with its bottom line. Learn more about the super cold temperature requirements for the coronavirus vaccine in my Daily News Brief for Nov. 18th, 2020:Get more Daily News Briefs at the Health Ranger channel on Brighteon.com Why are LNPs Lipid Nanoparticles used in these vaccines? As CHD further explains: LNPs “encapsulate the mRNA constructs to protect them from degradation and promote cellular uptake” and, additionally, rev up the immune system a property that vaccine scientists tamely describe as LNPs’ “inherent adjuvant properties” In other words, the LNPs are, meaning they are designed to cause hyperinflammatory responses in human beings, once injected. This is done in an effort to induce the creation of antibodies that then allow the vaccine manufacturer to claim high effectiveness rates, even when those very same adjuvants cause severe adverse reactions. According to recent vaccine trials conducted by Moderna, 100% of human subjects in the high-dose vaccine trial group experienced adverse reactions.The adverse reactions caused by mRNA coronavirus vaccines are so widespread that the UK government recently admitted it is expecting a massive wave of coronavirus vaccine adverse reactions / side effects. As described in my previous article,  VACCINE DEATH WAVE: UK government posts bid for AI system to process the expected flood of COVID-19 vaccine injuries and side effects described as a 'direct threat to patient life' : The UK government has posted a bid and an award contract notice, seeking an Artificial Intelligence AI system that can process the expected flood of covid-19 vaccine injuries and side effects. That bid explains, in the government's own words: The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence AI software tool to process the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction ADRs and ensure that no details from the ADRs’ reaction text are missed. In other words, they already know these vaccines are going to kill a huge number of people.

8a4136a2,"MONTGOMERY, Ala., Jan. 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that a chemical endangerment statute must protect children who have not been born yet. The strongly worded ruling is the most important affirmation of the personhood of the pre-born child since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.  The case was appealed to the AL Supreme Court by Amanda Kimbrough, a mother who admits that she smoked meth three days before her baby was born at 25 weeks. Tragically, baby Timmy lived for only a few minutes. The autopsy showed that the baby died from methamphetamine exposure.  The Alabama Supreme Court has dealt a massive blow to the constitutional fraud of Roe v. Wade by recognizing that the preborn child is a person, explained Personhood USA Legal Analyst Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D. This is yet another confirmation that the fight for personhood is targeting the Achilles' heel of the abortion industry and Roe v. Wade.  Kimbrough's attorney had previously debated Personhood Alabama founding member Attorney Ben DuPre on CNN. Kimbrough's attorney claimed in the interview that their case hinged upon the fact that the law regarding methamphetamine exposure to children did not apply to unborn children, only to born children.  The New York Times covered Kimbrough's case in in April, when she was found guilty of a Class A felony. The article quoted assistant district attorney Angela Hulsey as stating, She caused the death of another person, a person that will never have the chance to go to school, go to the prom, get married, have children of their own. You're dealing with the most innocent of victims.  The Alabama Supreme Court agreed with Hulsey, stating in their ruling that, The decision of this Court today is in keeping with the widespread legal recognition that unborn children are persons with rights that should be protected by law.

8772d0d9,"Henry Kissinger, eminence grise of imperial US foreign policy, has warned in an op-ed that no government – even his beloved hegemon – can defeat Covid-19 alone, implying that the New World Order he’s always preached must follow.  If the US doesn’t couple its efforts to rebuild its own economy with the first steps toward creating a global government, humanity is doomed, Kissinger wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed.  “No country, not even the US, can in a purely national effort overcome the virus,” Kissinger warned. “Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program.”  If we cannot do both in tandem, we will face the worst of each.  Kissinger laments that the pandemic has led to the return of a “walled city” model of nationalist governance, suggesting that “exploration at the frontiers of science” alone can save humanity from disease in his vision of a globalist utopia.  But developing cures takes time, and the notion that countries should be discouraged from protecting themselves in the interim is suicidal. If anything, one of the reasons Italy, Spain, and France were hit so hard by coronavirus was the EU’s dysfunctional insistence on open borders amid the pandemic.  “Global trade and movement of people” are all well and good, but the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of the globalist system like never before. It will take years for nations to rebuild, and repeating their mistakes is not something they can afford to do.  While serving as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser under presidents Nixon and Ford, Kissinger played a starring role in bombing campaigns against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and oversaw regime-change operations that placed brutal dictators in power in Argentina and Chile, as well as supporting state-sanctioned repression in Indonesia.  A notorious report he penned for the Ford administration called for dramatic reductions in population growth across developing nations. One might think, given his record, that he’d be on the side of the virus.  But the Nobel Peace Prize recipient is here presenting himself as an experienced statesman who deeply cares about the future of humanity, calling on the US to “draw lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project.”  Sure, revisiting the Marshall Plan makes sense – there are no doubt insights to be gained from revisiting the rebuilding of Europe’s shattered post-war economies, especially since some of the countries hit hardest by the epidemic are in Europe.  But the Manhattan Project? How does a top-secret, international doomsday project that produced weapons with unparalleled killing potential have any bearing on the coronavirus crisis?  Listening to Kissinger, it must be said, is what got the US into its current situation – believing itself exceptional, distrusting all world powers who do not swear abject fealty to it, repeating the same failed policies to the point of parody.  A looming presence in the George W. Bush administration, Kissinger advised the country to plunge headfirst into the ever-expanding War on Terror, penning an editorial in the days following 9/11 that called for taking on “any government that shelters groups capable of this kind of attack.”  Following such guidance has bankrupted the US and turned it into a banana republic, printing money frantically while its roads and bridges crumble, its citizens struggle to keep a roof over their heads, and the international community looks on, mouths agape, as its government continues to lecture them about human rights.  Kissinger concludes his jeremiad with a warning that “failure [to safeguard the principles of the liberal world order] could set the world on fire.”  If, as he himself writes, the “purpose of the legitimate state is to provide for the fundamental needs of the people: security, order, economic well-being, and justice,” those principles collapsed long ago.  The US’ first step, post-pandemic, should be to put out the fires set by Kissinger and those like him who seek to cloak empire in the rhetoric of liberal democracy.

3e8383dd,"The immune system is something that is highly misunderstood not just by everyday people but also by the many conventional doctors who we depend on for health advice.  Most people resort to things like synthetic vitamins and medicines ignoring better natural alternatives to deal with colds and improve immunity, but the cycle of sickness always seems to continue.  For people with compromised immune systems, there are many natural options, and now researchers have discovered what could well be one of the best ways to reset and recharge your immune system; one that happens to be free and is believed to work even in the elderly as well.  White blood cells right help immune response, and they can be recycled through fasting, the study showed.  Three Days to a Whole New Immune System  According to researchers at the University of Southern California, the act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system, even in elderly people.  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells, which help to fight off infection.  They added that the discovery could be especially effective for people suffering from damaged immune systems, including chemotherapy patients, who were protected from the toxic impacts of the treatment during the fasting period.  Flipping a “Regenerative Switch”  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells which help to fight off infection in the body.  “Fasting gives the ‘OK’ for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the entire system,” Prof. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, told the UK’s The Telegraph.  He added that the body actually removed parts that were damaged, old or inefficient during the fasting process, creating “literally, a new immune system.”  According to Dr. Longo a person’s system recycles unneeded immune cells, especially damaged ones, in order to create energy while they are fasting.  Over the course of his study’s trials, participants were asked to regularly fast between 2-4 days over a 6 month period.  The study was released in June and Dr. Longo said that clinical trials must still be completed, but added that the research looks “very promising.”  sources: telegraph, althealthworks, cell, medicalnewstoday, nationalpost, usc",“Very Promising:” USC Researchers Discover How to Regenerate Your Entire Immune System in 72 Hours,other
23bff2ff,"Rome, Italy – Italian law enforcement arrested scores of Cardinals early yesterday morning. The Italian military shortly afterward swept into Vatican City. The Italian parliament voted overwhelmingly to merge Vatican City into the city of Rome, effectively ending Catholicism’s reign over the city-state.  To Catch A Predators  Italian law enforcement worked for months to launch a sting program on the pedophile clergy that made up Vatican City. The operation was codenamed Spotlight after the 2015 movie about the clergy sex abuse scandal in Boston, Massachusetts.  Inspector Anthony Canard is the commanding officer of Spotlight. “Everyone knew Vatican City was the center of an international pedophile ring,” he stated. “We sent busloads of orphans into Vatican City for the annual Cardinal Convention. Long story short? The kids were never in harm’s way, and we nabbed a lot of perps.”  At that point, Vatican City was still an independent country. Italian police had to smuggle the cardinals out on the bus to face criminal charges in Italian courts.  Catholic clergy overseas are quick to point out their peers who are under arrest are victims of a virulent strain of anti-Catholicism and hatred of the man-boy sacrament.  Invasion!  Once Spotlight ended and the pedophile ring jailed, the Italian government moved quickly. Local units of the military swept into Vatican City. “We were sick and tired of looking the other way,” an anonymous politician noted.  Swiss Guards were caught unaware. It was obvious their pointy pikes were no match for assault rifles. The invasion was bloodless. No one was injured.  At this time, the Italian government isn’t sure what it’s going to do with all the wealth the papacy built up over the centuries. Insiders say many buildings will be transformed into museums. Other assets will probably be auctioned off and given to survivors of clergy abuse. “It’s poetic justice,” one government official remarked, “and the pedophile priests just got slammed with poetry.”  In related news, a 13-year-old boy gave up masturbating because Jesus wanted him to.

ed102064,"In his legal standing, former President Barack Obama is more or less the foremost Constitutional law authority in the United States. This weekend, he may have brought up a devastating wrinkle to President Trump’s outgoing plans for the Supreme Court as well as all of the lower jurisdictions.  According to an interview with Joe Barron of the Washington periodical Impeached Embarrassments Monthly, Trump lost his constitutional permission to assign or appoint any person to any legislative body of any kind after he was permanently and forever impeached in the course of his first and soon to be only term in office. Obama made the statement clear by citing code within the Constitution referring to the penalties of being a failed and disgraced commander in chief.  “Ah, if you folks look up Article eleven, section five, you’ll see very clearly where it denies any person elected to the Presidency and then consequently legally impeached by the Congress, all power of appointment that may ‘take responsibility for decisions in a manner that reflect the shame and disgrace of a leader who was shamed with the criminal reflection of his station.’ In other words, ah, it’s similar to denying a convicted prisoner the right to vote. It’s a legally-valid label of untrustworthiness. I mean, come on, you wouldn’t let someone who caused a dozen traffic pileups to drive a car the next day, right?”  Both Obama and his incredibly popular and successful wife Michelle are lawyers, despite many semi-mutated followers of Donald Trump believing they are unable to practice. Although, to be fair, these are mostly the same people who fervently believe that little people live inside their radios and sing thanks to witchcraft.  While it is permissible, barely, for the, again, permanently impeached President to travel from the White House to any destination within ten miles on his own, it is usually frowned upon due to Trump’s grain silo-like shape and weight.

Jill Biden is seeking to complete the assimilation process to turn the United States into part of Mexico and to give free healthcare and welfare to all illegal immigrants on the backs of American taxpayers.  Biden spokesperson Arturo Tubollos spoke to the press.  “Los Estados Unidos de América es el único país del mundo que tiene ciudadanos que se enorgullecen de saber un solo idioma. El resto del mundo se ríe de este país. Nos llaman estúpidos. Nos llaman ignorantes. Jill Biden hará que Estados Unidos vuelva a ser competitivo. Los estadounidenses sabrán si alguien los está insultando en español. Sabrán responder. ¡También tendremos fútbol en la televisión todo el tiempo! También vamos a dar lecciones gratuitas de cocina mexicana. La mayoría de la comida estadounidense sabe a aguas residuales, por lo que esto también será una mejora para sus vidas. También usaremos solo números arábigos porque podemos.”  Unfortunately, no one was there to translate, but Sr. Tubolls sure seemed excited about something. If he was excited about something in Spanish then we don’t want it in America!  We should follow the example of our current First Lady, Melania Trump. She is fluent in over 6 million forms of communication, though no one has ever actually witnessed her speaking any of those languages because we’re in the United States of America and we don’t do that here.

Teleportation is the process of moving objects from one place to another thanks to the transformation of matter into energy and its subsequent reconstruction based on Einstein’s famous formula.  We must take into account that there is no direct relation between teleportation as defined in science-fiction, and quantum teleportation, which is a technical-scientific term used in quantum physics to denote information transport.  The idea of teleportation became famous thanks to the Star Trek 1996 series. In that series, characters moved from their ship to other planets with incredible ease. At the same time, A Mosca was influenced by the tale of George Langelaan and studied the idea and constructed equipment that allowed the teleportation of matter in 1958.

28a4e080,"Corbis via Getty Images  Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world and a self-described nerd who is known for his early programming skills rather than his love of the outdoors, has been quietly snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. — enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.  After years of reports that he was purchasing agricultural land in places like Florida and Washington, The Land Report revealed that Gates, who has a net worth of nearly $121 billion according to Forbes, has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states. His largest holdings are in Louisiana 69,071 acres, Arkansas 47,927 acres and Nebraska 20,588 acres. Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.  According to The Land Report’s research, the land is held directly and through third-party entities by Cascade Investments, Gates’ personal investment vehicle. Cascade’s other investments include food-safety company Ecolab, used-car retailer Vroom and Canadian National Railway.  While it may be surprising that a tech billionaire would also be the biggest farmland owner in the country, this is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced $306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The foundation has further invested in the development and proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change and higher-yield dairy cows. Last year, the organization announced Gates Ag One, a nonprofit to advance those efforts.  It is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used, or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation. Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment. However, there is some indication that the land could be used in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values. Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade, is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections of crops, soil and water resources.  Gates is not the only billionaire on The Land Report’s list of top private farmland owners. Wonderful Company cofounders Stewart and Lynda Resnick net worth: $7.1 billion ranked number three with 190,000 acres. Their farmland produces the goods for their brands including POM Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos mandarins.  While Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner, he by no means is the largest individual landowner. In its list of 100 top American landowners, The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone, who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests. CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land across eight states. Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale, landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres, mainly in west Texas.",America’s Biggest Owner Of Farmland Is Now Bill Gates,FALSE

4457e1d4,"Border politics: San Diego Democrat Peters says Trump should stop beating up on Mexico  San Diego — As the federal budget showdown begins this week -- amid intense White House pressure for billions of dollars to construct a border wall — California Democratic Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego says that President Trump doesn't get it: that in a thriving urban area that’s home to one of the world’s busiest international crossings with Mexican neighbor Tijuana, “we view the border as an opportunity – not a threat.”  Peters also sharply challenged U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was in San Diego last week to talk up the border wall construction, and who suggested that cities here are “crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime.  Peters’ advice to the Trump administration: “Stop beating up on Mexico. They’re friends of ours, the best trading partner. And an extremely important ally…And we’d like someone to hear us,’’ he said. “There’s not a lot of appreciation…for how important Mexican trade is — not just for Texas, and New Mexico and Arizona and California, but the whole country.”  Peters, who represents California’s 52nd Congressional District — which includes San Diego, Coronado and La Jolla — sat down with POLITICO California before Friday’s 2107 Congressional Lunch sponsored by the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. There, 500 business leaders from both Mexico and California convened to hear from a bipartisan panel of House members including Peters, his fellow Democrats Rep. Juan Vargas and Susan Davis, and Republican Reps. Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter.  The San Diego Democrat, first elected in 2012, said that even as the Trump administration has made border issues a lynchpin of its agenda and budget, it has failed to reach out to legislators, like himself, who are at the epicenter of border politics in the region — and who are deeply concerned that White House policies are threatening “millions of dollars in economic activity,’’ and millions of jobs in a region where international cooperation has produced prosperity on both sides.  “It’s really counterproductive to have the Trump administration taking about a wall, a border adjustment tax -- and this attitude about Mexico like they are not our friends. They are good friends to San Diego.”  Some excerpts from the conversation:  POLITICO: Your response to AG Sessions saying cities like San Diego are “crumbling” under the weight of crime from the border?  Peters: “We always crow about San Diego and El Paso being two of the safest cities in America, which is true. In San Diego, we view the border as an opportunity, not as a threat.”  POLITICO: What’s your view of Trump’s border wall proposal -- and his requests for billions to build it?  Peters: “There’s so many better and more cost effective ways to deal with security. What’s the issue with border security? It’s the one percent of cargo that contains stuff you don’t want coming in — whether it’s drugs or guns. And so what you do for that is not build a wall..that can be tunneled under. And can’t really be physically constructed. You hire more customs and border patrol agents -- more blue shirts. Fewer brown shirts. You employ better technology to catch that stuff, and you would save so much money — and get the job done.”  POLITICO: What about the business concerns here on the border?  Peters: “When I was first elected in 2013, I went to Jerry Sanders — the former mayor, who’s head of the Chamber now -- and asked, “What’s the most important thing we can do for the business community in Washington D.C.?” And he said: “The border waits are killing us. They were two hours up to four hours. The funding had stalled for the San Ysidro Border Crossing crossing, which is the busiest land crossing in the world...So frankly, the five of us in the House delegation worked together to get that done. The Democrats worked together, speaking to the President and the Senate at that time..and we got Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter to get help us put that into the budget. And I think it was one of the biggest expenditures for infrastructure in that two-year cycle, and now it’s on track, almost done. The waits are way down. It was tens of thousands of jobs, and millions of dollars in economic activity from these delays….it means money on both sides of the border.”  POLITICO: What’s about Trump’s view of this issue?  Peters: It’s really counterproductive to have the Trump Administration taking about a wall, a border adjustment tax — and this attitude about Mexico like they are not our friends. They are such good friends of San Diego….The Senate took the right approach in 2013, which was probably more armament than border security than we would want, but that was the compromise Democrats had to make to get permission slips for the workforce, reunited families and people coming out of the shadows and paying taxes. That was a good plan. We couldn’t get a vote on the House floor. But now we’ve taken a step backwards with Jeff Sessions in charge.”  POLITICO: “What about comprehensive immigration reform? Will it happen -- and what’s the cost if it doesn’t?  PETERS: “In 2013, who was for comprehensive immigration reform? The Chamber of Commerce. The AFL-CIO. The tech community. The faith community. The farmworkers — and the farmers. Because everybody knows this is an important part of our workforce. Around here, we have a lot of scientific jobs. I think 60 percent of our scientists are immigrants in California….we want to be the center of this brain-powered economy -- and we are scaring away scientists. People are afraid to go to work because they’re afraid of being rounded up. They’re getting their kids documents prepared in case the parents are shipped off. It’s just awful.  POLITICO: “What other worries are you hearing from constituents here?”  Peters: “Our three drivers here in San Diego are tourism, the military and science and technology...we’re one of the top three biotechnology regions in the country, and in clean energy technology too. We’ve checked in with The Navy; if we don’t pass the 2017 budget, they’re talking here about five ships that won’t be available to sail just out of the Western region — and 15 worldwide...the money for the wall? That’s, by the way, the cost of one and a half aircraft carriers.  POLITICO: With 100 days of the Trump administration this week, the president has been pushing repeal of Obamacare again and says the GOP has a “great” plan to replace. Your response?  Peters: “I think it’s not great. And I think people hate it… We’re going to go back to the model we had before effectively. And going back to losing your house to pay your medical bills is just not where we want to go….“People are terrified. I spoke to University of San Diego medical students, and faculty members who said now the children of some of these undocumented people are citizens, but the parents are too scared to take them to the doctor even if they have cancer. So they wait until they go to the emergency room where they don’t have to have documentation. And it’s too late for the kids...they can die. It’s tragic.”  POLITICO: What’s the chances of the GOP's health care plan passing?  Peters: “We’ve heard nothing from Trump, in a direct way...he’s got nobody working there, and the level of administrative chaos is just astounding, when you think of his work as a business person. But when you think back about his business, it was a family business about which hotels to open, it wasn’t running a multi-faceted operation.  Now, they’re the dog that caught the car.

This is why it is shocking to hear that House Democrats moved to hold a vote on removing the national anthem before sporting events, citing its offensiveness to people from other countries.  The bill is expected to easily pass as all professional sports events have been suspended indefinitely.  Ilhan Omar says the move was inspired by professional kneeler Colin Kaepernick. She says he spoke to her recently and inspired her to act:  “We had a meeting with Colin Kaepernick a few weeks ago and he talked to us about criminal justice reform and ways we can help.

We will have the national anthem banned. It’s not representative of America.”  Republicans are not having it. They are riled up over this news. Senator Joe Barron issued this statement:  “We will not allow this nonsense to go forward. The national anthem is very relevant to sporting events. It should be said thrice a day in fact. We will be pushing a bill to make it mandatory to be sung at all schools and workplaces in the nation thrice daily. The song represents freedom, so we will require it.

312b0fa0,"COLUMBUS — Ohio’s latest battle over workers’ rights lasted about 36 hours.  A day after word leaked out that two bills and a proposed constitutional amendment were about to be introduced to make Ohio the 25th “right-to-work” state, Senate President Keith Faber R., Celina shot down the legislation’s chances in his chamber.  “We have an ambitious agenda focused on job creation and economic recovery, and right-to-work legislation is not on that list,” Mr. Faber said. “After discussions with other leaders and my caucus, I don’t believe there is current support for this issue in the General Assembly.  “The only purpose this discussion serves right now is to generate a bunch of breathless fund-raising appeals from the Ohio Democratic Party.”  The bills would prohibit employees who refuse to join a workplace bargaining unit from being forced to pay fees in lieu of union dues. Their backers took issue with comparisons with the contentious fight over Senate Bill 5 that ended in an embarrassing defeat for Republicans in 2011.  “Senate Bill 5 was about collective bargaining and putting sort of guardrails around collective bargaining … ,” Rep. Kristina Roegner R., Hudson said. “This is quite the opposite of that. This is saying, ‘Workers, you have the freedom to join a union, to pay to be represented by them, or not.’ ”  The fight over Senate Bill 5 in 2011 filled the Statehouse and its lawn with protesters and placed Ohio in the national spotlight right up to the point when voters soundly rejected the law at the ballot box that November.  The “fair-share fee” issue was one of numerous provisions that had been tacked onto Senate Bill 5 and ultimately never went into effect.  Tom Enright, a Walbridge construction electrician and treasurer of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 8 in Toledo, was among about 50 protesters chanting “O-H-I-O, right-to-work has got to go!” outside the Statehouse on Wednesday.  “It takes away your rights as a union member. There’s no freedom here,’’ Mr. Enright said. “Right now if someone doesn’t want to pay union dues, they might have that right. They can pay for the services they use from that union.  “All right-to-work says is the union has got to represent you, and you don’t have to pay anything. They’re getting something for free. That’s not right, and it’s not fair to everyone else.”  Gov. John Kasich’s dismal poll numbers immediately after Senate Bill 5’s rebuke at the polls have since recovered, so Democrats have been eager to tie him to what they characterize as a new round of anti-worker legislation going into his 2014 re-election campaign.  In a fund-raising email, Ed FitzGerald, Cuyahoga County executive and the only announced Democratic candidate for governor next year, characterized the lawmakers behind the bills as “Governor Kasich’s Statehouse friends.”  Mr. Kasich has not embraced either proposal and has attempted to distance himself from the issue in general, even as neighboring Michigan and Indiana became right-to-work states and a separate petition effort was launched in Ohio to put the question directly to voters.  Ms. Roegner stressed that the new proposals did not come from the governor’s office. The two bills would have required the governor’s signature to become law. The joint resolution putting the question on the ballot would not.  Both sides cite statistics while supporting their arguments. Opponents claim that right-to-work states have seen wages decline, while supporters argue that new and expanding industries prefer “workplace freedom” states.  In recent years, however, Ohio’s economy has generally recovered at a faster pace than the nation as a whole. Ms. Roegner and co-sponsor Rep. Ron Maag R., Lebanon, however, argued that Ohio would probably have fared better as a workplace freedom state.  “Another thing we need to look at is our neighbor to the north and our neighbor to the west that have now both become right-to-work states,” Mr. Maag said. “Over time, I’m sure, if we look the data, that they will be taking jobs from Ohio.  “We’re doing a great job now, but we’re going to continue to make Ohio the place where workers and employers want to be.”  ",Ohio Senate tables proposed right-to-work bills,partially false
39d8b03f,"State Dining Room  4:22 P.M. EST  THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, folks. The Vice President and I have some good news to report, and I’d like to make two key announcements today related to our COVID-19 vaccination effort.  As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening — open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal.  But that’s — one of my first goals in office was — when I got into office was to say that there will be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We’ve got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we’ll make it all the way.  As I — and as I’ve said, we have a long way to go, but, you know, as I said from the outset, we’re going to use every resource of the federal government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came into office was that Johnson & Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we pote- — while we had the potential of another highly effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn’t coming fast enough. So my team — my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.  As I’ve always said, this was a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches.  And today, we’re announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world — that are usually competitors — are working together on the vaccine. Johnson & Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two.  We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7.  In addition, we’ll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.  I’ve also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s efforts. And I want to thank Johnson & Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis.  Here’s what all this means: We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.  Let me say that again: When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About three weeks ago, we were able to say that we’ll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July.  And I’m pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I’ve ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply — I’ll say it again — for every adult in America by the end of May. By the end of May. That’s progress — important progress.  But it’s not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people’s arms, millions of Americans’ arms.  To date, we’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses. We’ve developed — we deployed more than 1,500 federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency — FEMA — and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands of more to come.  We’re also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We’ve sent millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot.  The federal government is also working with states to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill and I just visited one in Houston last week. It’s incredible.  And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely.  Right now, an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents; they understand. We’re already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation.  Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed. And remote learning isn’t the same for every student, as you all know.  Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs.  Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for — and further undermining the health of our economy.  This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal of having a majority of our K-through-8 schools open by the end of my first 100 days as President.  To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely — reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus. All cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week, and I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well.  You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely. It’s a roadmap that will enable schools — if they have the resources they deserve — to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I’ve asked Congress to give them the tools. And today, to add one more tool to school reopening: a vaccinated workforce.  Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we’ve heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that.  So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let’s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers who provide that service — educators, school staff, childcare workers — get them vaccinated immediately. They’re essential workers.  Over 30 states have already taken step to prior- –prioritize educators for vaccination. And today, I’m using the full authority of the federal government. I’m directing every state to do the same. My challenge to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.  To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month — the month of March, we will be using our federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and child-care workers. Throughout March, they will be able to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K-through-12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them.  And I want to be very clear: Not every educator will be able to get their appointment in the first week, but our goarl [sic] — goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March.  I want to conclude with this: We’re making progress from the mess we inherited. We’re moving in the right direction. And today’s announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over. I told you I’d be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South. But our administration will never take this public health threat lightly.  Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks — keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I’ve asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now is not the time to let our guard down. People’s lives are at stake.  We have already — we have already — and I carry this in my pocket — lost more — as of today, we’ve lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It’s got to stop.  We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing states for their efforts.  We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now. Now.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can’t assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That’s how we’re going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.  So thank you. And please, please, it’s not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much.  Q Mr. President, based on the news you announced, when do you think things will get back to normal? When do you think things will get back to normal?  THE PRESIDENT: When do I think things will get back to normal? I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure. But my hope is, by this time next year, we’re going to be back to normal, and before that — my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue — continue to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There’s a lot we have to do yet. So thank you.  Q Did you receive a briefing about the border today?  THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I did.  Q What did you learn?  THE PRESIDENT: A lot.  Q Is there a crisis at the border, sir?

The FBI is reportedly making arrangements to fly in and interrogate him once Interpol is done with him.  Giuseppe Governale, Italy’s chief anti-mafia prosecutor, was called in early into the investigation into Pope Francis and others within the Vatican. He said the group was “underestimated” and particularly dangerous because of its ability to proliferate across nations and infiltrate them.  “These individuals are truly the worst of the worst in society. I can promise you, we will not stop targeting human trafficking until we put a stop to this despicable trade in the Vatican and Italy, as well as surrounding countries around Europe. While I am a lead prosecutor in Italy, my department will strive to protect our citizens, especially those that need us most, our children”. Giuseppe Governale  In order to make the arrest, police and military agents had to cut off the power in the Vatican, as well as dim the live cam.

32cd89e8,"Top pathologist Dr. Roger Hodkinson told government officials in Alberta during a zoom conference call that the current coronavirus crisis is “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.”  Hodkinson’s comments were made during a discussion involving the Community and Public Services Committee and the clip was subsequently uploaded to YouTube.  Noting that he was also an expert in virology, Hodkinson pointed out that his role as CEO of a biotech company that manufactures COVID tests means, “I might know a little bit about all this.”  “There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians, it’s outrageous, this is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public,” said Hodkinson.  The doctor said that nothing could be done to stop the spread of the virus besides protecting older more vulnerable people and that the whole situation represented “politics playing medicine, and that’s a very dangerous game.”  Hodkinson remarked that “social distancing is useless because COVID is spread by aerosols which travel 30 meters or so before landing,” as he called for society to be re-opened immediately to prevent the debilitating damage being caused by lockdowns.  Hodkinson also slammed mandatory mask mandates as completely pointless.  “Masks are utterly useless. There is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever,” he said.  “Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue signalling. They’re not even worn effectively most of the time. It’s utterly ridiculous. Seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people – I’m not saying that in a pejorative sense – seeing these people walking around like lemmings obeying without any knowledge base to put the mask on their face.”  The doctor also slammed the unreliability of PCR tests, noting that “positive test results do not, underlined in neon, mean a clinical infection,” and that all testing should stop because the false numbers are “driving public hysteria.”  Hodkinson said that the risk of death in the province of Alberta for people under the age of 65 was “one in three hundred thousand,” and that it was simply “outrageous” to shut down society for what the doctor said “was just another bad flu.”  “I’m absolutely outraged that this has reached this level, it should all stop tomorrow,” concluded Dr. Hodkinson.  Hodkinson’s credentials are beyond question, with the MedMalDoctors website affirming his credibility.  “He received his general medical degrees from Cambridge University in the UK M.A., M.B., B. Chir. where he was a scholar at Corpus Christi College. Following a residency at the University of British Columbia he became a Royal College certified general pathologist FRCPC and also a Fellow of the College of American Pathologists FCAP.”  “He is in good Standing with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, and has been recognized by the Court of Queen’s Bench in Alberta as an expert in pathology.”  In case the above video gets deleted by YouTube, a backup via Bitchute is available here.

80109510,"Hunter Biden certainly has had more than his fair share of strokes of luck lately.  First, despite all of the evidence found on his laptop, nothing has stuck to him.  Next, after John Isaac, the owner of the computer repair shop where Hunter Biden left his laptop gave it to Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Giuliani, in turn, provided it to the FBI as evidence.  Unfortunately, the FBI managed to lose the laptop under mysterious circumstances, and thus all of the evidence contained on it.  Finally, last week, after being harassed and bullied at his home in Delaware by associates ostensibly tied to the Bidens and the ever-present deep state, Mr. Isaac closed up his shop and moved to Colorado, where he opened up a new computer repair shop in hopes of returning his life back to normal.  And now, John Isaac has been found dead, also under highly mysterious circumstances.  Early Wednesday morning a loud explosion was heard throughout South Park, CO, waking up residents from their sleep. When police and fire arrived at the scene, they were confronted by a blazing inferno that had entirely engulfed Mr. Isaac’s new computer repair shop.  A forensic examination found that the cause of the explosion was a laptop that had been dropped off by a local high school student, Eric Cartman. Young Mr. Cartman had ostensibly brought in his laptop because he had inadvertently viewed German poop porn on it in which his mother Liane, who is regarded as a local slut by many South Park residents, played a starring role.  The event had so traumatized the young man that he wanted his hard drive wiped.  In a bizarre coincidence, this is the very same Eric Cartman that was a first-hand witness to the murder of Clinton Foundation investigator Kenneth McCormick, which is currently under investigation by the FBI.  Exactly how the explosives found their way onto Eric Cartman’s laptop is a mystery, although Eric’s Neighbor Kyle Broflovski was able to offer some insights:  “OMG! They didn’t kill Kenny? Those bastards blew up Eric’s laptop! How are we going to watch porn now? Eric was the only one of us with a laptop and access to the internet. I bet it was those Clinton Foundation people, the same ones that killed Kenny the last time.”  This is not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last, that those who dare to investigate the Biden/Clinton/Obama crime syndicate will pay with their lives.",Computer Shop Owner Who Raised Alarm About Hunter Biden Laptop Found Dead,FALSE
98c73066,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is continuing his personal crusade against Big Pharma and Big Government collusion, authoring a hard-hitting article explaining that the government are withholding information from the public about vaccines – and covering up vaccine deaths – in order to protect pharmaceutical companies.  RFK Jr. writes:  Vaccine scientists and the public health community cautiously and occasionally will admit that vaccines can cause adverse reactions just like “any other medication or biological product.” Although experts are less willing to openly disclose the fact that adverse reactions can and do include death, one has only to look at reports to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS to see that mortality is a possible outcome.  From 1990 through 2010, for example, VAERS received 1,881 reports of infant deaths following vaccination, representing 4.8% of the adverse events reported for infants over the 20-year period.  Moreover, analysts acknowledge that VAERS, as a passive surveillance system, is subject to substantial underreporting. A federal government report from 2010 affirms that VAERS captures only about 1% of vaccine adverse reports.  On the international frontier, the public health community—with the World Health Organization WHO in the vanguard—previously used a six-category framework to investigate and categorize serious adverse events following immunization AEFI, including death.  Guided by this tool, public health teams examined temporal criteria and possible alternative explanations to determine whether the relationship of an AEFI to vaccine administration was “very likely/certain,” “probable,” “possible,” “unlikely,” “unrelated,” or “unclassifiable.”  [Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Drops Vaccine Truth Bomb Live On TV]  In 2013, the WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety discarded the prior tool, ostensibly because users “sometimes [found it] difficult to differentiate between ‘probable,’ ‘possible,’ and ‘unlikely’ categories.” The WHO enlisted vaccine experts to develop a “simpler” algorithm that would be more readily “applicable” to vaccines. The resulting four-category system now invites public health teams to classify an AEFI as either “consistent,” “inconsistent,” or “indeterminate” with a vaccine-related causal association or as “unclassifiable.”  Despite the patina of logic suggested by the use of an algorithm, “the final outcome of the case investigation depends on the personal judgment of the assessor” [emphasis added], especially according to the tool’s proponents when the process “yields answers that are both consistent and inconsistent with a causal association to immunization.”  In a 2017 letter in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, Drs. Jacob Puliyel an India-based pediatrician and member of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization and Anant Phadke an executive member of the All India Drug Action Network raise important questions about the revised tool.  They describe an Orwellian Catch-22 situation wherein it is nearly impossible to categorize post-vaccine deaths as vaccine-related. This is because the revised algorithm does not allow users to classify an AEFI as “consistent with causal association with vaccine” unless there is evidence showing that the vaccine caused a statistically significant increase in deaths during Phase III clinical trials.  By definition, however, any vaccine not found to “retain safety” in Phase III trials cannot proceed to Phase IV licensure and post-marketing surveillance. The result of the algorithm’s convoluted requirements is that any deaths that occur post-licensure become “coincidental” or “unclassifiable.”  Drs. Puliyel and Phadke describe what happened in India when the country’s National AEFI committee assessed 132 serious AEFI cases reported between 2012 and 2016, including 54 infant deaths that followed administration of a pentavalent all-in-one vaccine intended to protect recipients against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b infections. For babies who survived hospitalization, the committee classified three-fifths 47/78 of the AEFI as causally related to vaccines with 47% of the incidents viewed as “product-related” and 13% as “error-related”, but they rated nearly all 52/54 of the deaths as either coincidental 54% or unclassifiable 43% despite mounting evidence that pentavalent and hexavalent vaccines are increasing the risk of sudden unexpected death in infants.  …doctors who “naïvely” accept biased reports on vaccine safety “are losing the trust of the public and in the process…endangering public health.”  The absurdity and negligence inherent in the ultimately subjective WHO checklist have not escaped the attention of others in India and beyond. In a series of comments published in the journal Vaccine in response to the 2013 publication of the revised tool, commenters issued the following scathing remarks:  “Even if a healthy child dies within minutes following vaccination and there is no alternate explanation for the AEFI, even then the powers that be could easily declare that death as coincidental and not due to the vaccine, thanks to the new AEFI. This is dangerous ‘science’.”  “Amongst the 20 items of their checklist, no less than 15 75% are devoted to refute a vaccine-induced causality [emphasis in original]…. After all and as the authors confess with an astonishing ingenuousness, the main point is to ‘maintain public confidence in immunization programs.’”  “People understand that there are no true coincidences—only events that have been made to appear to be coincidental by either a genuine lack of understand[ing] of the overall facts leading to the ‘coincidence’ reported or by the deliberate suppression of the facts, including when…AEFIs that result in death are made to ‘disappear.’”  “It seems that huge business in [the] vaccine industry is affecting [the] science of vaccines and we are developing various ways to promote the business at the cost of human lives. …Going for a less sensitive tool for safety concerns is not only illogical but risky for the children of the world.”  Unfortunately, many vaccine proponents appear to be more concerned with forestalling “misconceptions” and “erroneous conclusions about cause and effect” than they are about preventing and identifying adverse events following vaccination. The result, as Dr. Puliyel argues, is that doctors who “naïvely” accept biased reports on vaccine safety “are losing the trust of the public and in the process…endangering public health.”",Robert F.

1108fcb4,"UPDATE: April 3, 2019, 2:50 PM  Bloomberg reports Hass Avocado prices surged Tuesday as the result of importers stockpiling produce. However, things may get worse. Vice president and senior analyst at Rabobank, Roland Fumasi, told Bloomberg that prices could easily double or triple if we shut down the border.  ORIGINAL STORY: April 1, 2019, 3:40 P.M.  As President Trump continues his threats to close the border, analysts are looking at how that would impact Americans' food supply. In a report published today, Reuters cited recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture that says nearly half of all imported vegetables and 40 percent of imported fruits are grown in Mexico.  While there are other countries that produce the fruits and vegetables we consume, it would take time to adjust trade plans. One of the most imminent problems we'd face would be an avocado shortage, should the border actually close in the next week.  Steve Barnard, the president of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world, told Reuters that because Mexico supplies most of the avocados sold in the U.S. at this time of year, closing the border would mean running out of avocados in as little as three weeks.  California's growing season is just starting, so avocados grown there wouldn't be ready for another month or so. Of note, Barnard told Reuters that California has a very small crop. Depending on how long trade was halted, that could mean fewer avocados in stores and higher prices on the ones that are available.  Other produce that could be in short supply include tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries, and raspberries, the majority of which all currently come from Mexico.

Senator Marco Rubio R-FL did the honors this time after he fired-off a biblical quote over the popular social media platform this morning targeting the president and his sycophantic minions.  President Trump appeared at a campaign-style rally last night in Pensacola, Florida to stump for accused sexual predator Roy Moore, who’s running in a special election next week in nearby Alabama to fill the senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  In addition to the de rigueur attacks on Democratic leaders and the “fake news” media that form the backbone of Trump’s rambling speeches at these events, the president added a new twist: victim-shaming the women who have accused Moore of sexually assaulting them, of which there are 9 in total, two of whom were attacked when they were minors.  The crowd, composed largely of Rubio’s fellow Floridians, ate it all up, cheering and howling every time Trump lobbed one of these verbal molotov cocktails. It was this display that moved the normally mild mannered Senator from Miami to lash out on Twitter and throw Republicans from his own state under the bus:  At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity 4 them b/c they were troubled & abandoned like sheep without a shepherd.Matthew9:36 — Marco Rubio @marcorubio December 9, 2017  Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

The two clashed during the Republican primary, with Trump famously nicknaming Rubio “Little Marco.” Once Trump locked-up the Republican nomination, Rubio withheld his support until the very last minute, and he was quick to criticize the candidate whenever his campaign hit the rocks.  As harsh a critic as he was during the campaign, however, Rubio has been a staunch supporter of President Trump’s agenda in the only way that really matters: with his vote in the senate. These tweets and other critiques are amusing, but they do absolutely nothing to oppose the destruction caused by someone Rubio once called a “dangerous con-man.”  If he really holds this low of an opinion of the president and his base supporters, then it would be nice to see that opposition reflected in his voting record.

c17d5523,"David Davis: There has long been an alternative to this discredited deal. It’s the Canada-style plan that Tusk and Barnier offered us.  David Davis is MP for Haltemprice and Howden, and is a former Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.  The Spice Girls had it right when they said: ‘stop right now thank you very much’.  Yes, last week was another frenzied one in British politics. The Prime Minister’s proposed agreement with the EU has gone down like a lead balloon. I’m afraid it is a failure of nerve by the establishment. Their antics have led to the resignation of two Brexit Secretaries – myself and now Dominic Raab.  MPs, Party members and the British public are rightly dismayed. The consequence is that now there is speculation about the leadership of the Conservative Party.  This is not the Brexit they voted for. This proposal would keep the UK permanently trapped in EU institutions and under EU domination. This is not taking back control of borders, laws and money, which 17.4 million people voted for. It breaks our commitment to leave the Customs Union in the 2017 Conservative Manifesto. This proposed deal will never get through the Commons.  It really is time to stop right now, and say thank you very much.  So that’s where we are. But this is a time for calm heads. The crucial point is there is still time to save Brexit, still time to take control and still time to offer the British people a brighter future. This is the moment of truth. We can reject the proposed agreement and move on. We still have time because the key date in the calendar is 21st January, 2019. Only then does the Government need to make a statement within five days on what the United Kingdom plans to do, according to the European Union Withdrawal Act of 2018.  So, we can use the time until then productively. We know from past experience that the EU always leaves agreement to the final moment possible at the eleventh hour. Everybody in the UK wants the hope of a better deal – and trust me, we can do this. I spent countless hours negotiating with EU counterparts, and I know the great prize of a Canada-style free trade agreement is still possible. Indeed, it is very much still on. Both Michel Barnier and Donald Tusk have confirmed this.  Justin Trudeau said of his country’s free trade deal that it has created “good, well-paying jobs”, putting “food on the table for families”, helping to “grow and strengthen our communities” and ensuring that each generation is “better off” and has a “higher standard of living, than the one that preceded it.”  The question is how do we get there? It does not have to be like this. What we need now is leadership and the courage and confidence to deliver for the UK. We can deliver an honest and clean Brexit, leaving all the possibilities such as global free trade deals open for bright future. If we need to leave with no deal and negotiate a free trade agreement during the transition period, so be it. Let’s be clear and honest and tell the EU that’s what we are prepared to do.  As we leave the EU, our geography remains fixed. We remain an island maritime nation, outward-facing and trading across the globe. British goods and services are recognised as the best in the world, and are sought after by global customers. This cannot and will not change.  We can go back to the EU and say, if necessary, we are prepared to leave on world trade terms without a deal, but we would rather agree a positive way forward for all sides. We only need to be ready to trade under World Trade Organisation rules: international laws that regulate the trading relationships of 164 member states and around 98 per cent of global trade.  It in all our interests – the UK’s, the EU member states’ and most importantly the British people’s – that we start again and sort this our properly. Let us become, once again, a self-governing, free-trading nation. This is the best approach to unite the Conservative Party and address the huge concerns of MPs, members and activists.  Then we can stop being ‘always on the run’, look beyond Brexit – and provide the ‘human touch’ by focussing on issues like housing, education, health and crime that matter so much in the lives of families up and down our country.",David Davis: There has long been an alternative to this discredited deal.

8987057d,"Nation  U.S. STATE GOVERNORS NAMES ON CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY **MEMBERSHIP** LIST  A database obtained by computer hackers from China Communist Party computers allegedly reveals the names of more than a DOZEN U.S. State Governors who are reportedly shown in the database as being MEMBERS of China's Communist Party:  The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government. Here is a statement from IPAC about the data:  Detailed analysis by U.S. Intelligence sources say the list is genuine!  The list mostly includes the details of CCP members based in Shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. The CCP's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.  China Communist Party CCP members have infiltrated not only some of the largest corporations of the US, Australia and the UK, but also many consulates and government agencies, giving them access to sensitive and no doubt compromising information that would give the CCP an edge on the world stage.  Make no mistake, these agents ultimately answer directly to the party and Chairman Xi Jinping.  This is a fascinating look inside the CCP’s infiltration network and gives us an idea of just how deeply their agents have been embedded.  The original database in Chinese contains some 1.95 million names, the majority from Shanghai, many complete with National ID number & personal details, but also contains the details of some 79,000 communist party branches, many of them INSIDE the companies they have infiltrated. Some of the names are listed as having been “executed” while others have notes regarding organs and a price.  Take a quick look at how the CCP works:  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who ran what may be the most fraudulent election in the nation on November 3, where President Trump lost the traditionally Red State, has a brother. Meet Brother, Ron Raffensperger CTO for HUAWEI Enterprise Storage Solutions, the Data Storage Company of . . . . the CCP.  The same Chinese Communist Party CCP that paid DOMINION $400 million through a subsidiary of HSBC, a month or so BEFORE the November 3 election, which may have gotten the CCP the ability to update Dominion voting software for the then-upcoming U.S. Presidential Election!  Elsewhere, other key people are tunring out to have strong connections to the CCP. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – currently obstructing efforts to investigate Michigan’s election results – developed ties with Chinese state-run universities and trained lawyers for the Chinese Communist Party – even delivering a lecture at Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s alma mater.    Benson undertook the work aiding the Chinese Communist Party while serving as the Dean of Wayne Law School in Detroit, Michigan.  Being the CTO for a mega corporation like HUAWEI pays huge bucks. Maybe some of that money is going to a certain Secretary of State? Who knows what's happening between the two brothers . . . maybe at the behest of the CCP?  China's infiltration efforts have been vast. Major aerospace companies Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Boeing have employed hundreds of CCP members. Additionally, Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine developer! employed a total of 123 Party members. British automaker Jaguar Land Rover also employed CCP members.  Now, back to the USA. The Governors allegedly named in the database are listed below:    AZ - Ducey    AR - Hutchinson    CA - Newsome    CT - Lamont    NM - Grisham    VT - Scott    IA - Reynolds    RI - Raimondo    NE - Ricketts    DE - Carney    IN - Holcomb    NV - Sisolak    TN - Lee    KY - Beshear    ID - Little    MT - Bullock    OR - Brown    IL - Pritzker    LA - Edwards    TX - Abbott    MN - Waltz    MA- Baker  NC-Cooper    UT - Herbert  Other names totaling 1.9 Million people, are also on the list, which is still being sorted and translated. The process of translating is taking longer than expected, but it looks like this: Click image to enlarge  POMPEO WARNED THEM ALL  Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, spoke at the National Governor's Association Winter Meeting and HE WARNED GOVERNORS they were being targeted by China. He told the Governors that China was doing harm to the US and to our industries, and they were moving to manipulate Governors into doing things that would help China AT THE EXPENSE of America. Pompeo warned them all to be careful.  The warning apparently came too late because based on the information outlined above, obtained from computer hackers, it SEEMS that several U.S. State Governors may have already sold-out and become Communists.  COMMUNISM ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES  The Communist Party is unlawful in the United States. It's very existence is banned by federal law. Here is the law:  Of course, while the federal law above bans the Communist Party of the United States, it does NOT ban the Communist Party of China. The question then becomes, have these Governors become members of the China Communist Party CCP for the SAME PURPOSE as that previously espoused by the Communist Party of the United States? Same political ideology . . . same goal?  Folks who live in states whose Governor's name appears on the CCP Member List, need to make a major fuss about this and find out what's what.

013da3e3,"As the giant hydra-armed machine that is the snarling, lurching Biden campaign lumbers on towards the 2020 election, it has begun to drop all pretense of innocent operation. Holding virtual rallies, releasing a slew of negative ads across the airwaves nationwide, and selling facemasks emblazoned with images of the candidate’s face are just a few of the money-making schemes running for its benefit. But now, Joe Barron, head of the FBI’s Department of Detectivity says they’ve gone too far by accepting a check for thirty-one dollars from the organization called “Antifa.”  The donation, which arrived yesterday at campaign headquarters in Floppyballs, California, was confirmed to have been vetted by interns, and deposited into campaign coffers by Democrat volunteer Calypso Soros, a second cousin of the well-known billionaire. Barron detailed the possible actionable offense:  “Anything from Antifa is blood money, because they have been officially labelled an Anti-American organization by both Trumptards International and Diamond and Silk’s ‘Tents Can Be Clothes’ retail outlet stores. Accepting that money is the same as if you picked up a dollar on the street that a serial killer had dropped two days before. Sure, it seems innocent : but you’re still infected with evil. Biden might as well wear satanic cthulu robes and decapitate a chicken on top of Mother Theresa’s grave for what that thirty one dollars has done to his soul.”  So far, representitives of the Vice President’s campaign haven’t commented on what is sure to become a very serious scandal, but just like his rival Donald Trump, it will bloat and fester until one day it will no doubt explode in some Popeye’s chicken restroom.",Biden Accepts Campaign Donation From Antifa,other
23e4bd3b,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative CHAI distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.  The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.  The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.  It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.  Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.  [dcquiz] The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.  “This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.  “When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.  The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.  “The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.  The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.  Blackburn said she planned to deliver the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.  The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.  It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.  ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”  “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.  Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.  “These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.  Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.  The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”  Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.  Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.  Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.  Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.  The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”  CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.  Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”  “In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.  The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.  He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.  CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.  CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.  The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.  Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.  The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.  The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.  One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.  Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.  Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.  Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.  “You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients.

36299bfd,"Joe Biden has shown us all whose side he’ll be on when it comes to law and order.  In a sweeping secret pardon that includes more than 2,616 BLM “protesters,” Biden gave a big eff you to law enforcement.  Biden’s pardon includes “anyone arrested for protesting in a non-violent manner.” Basically, all they have to do is say “I dint do nuffin” and they’re free to go.  According to the White House, there is no pardon, and the issue of BLM protesters has yet to be addressed at all. According to Communications Director, Art Tubolls, the whole thing has been blown out of proportion:  “More like…made up. There is no pardon for anyone because Trump’s federal goons never actually arrested anyone. They just dropped them off in the morning in front of the closaest Circle K with $2 for a large coffee and a blintz.”  Fact-checkers were quick to point out that Circle K doesn’t sell blintzes.  At any rate, the pardons may not be real to some people, but to those of us who believe Joe Biden is the next coming of the antichrist here to unseat Donald Trump and thrust America into the pits of hell, they’re as real as can be, and we won’t stand for it.  A source close to the President said the pardons may not exist, but that Biden was “very proud” to be able to sign them. Whether or not he signed them virtually or just in spirit remains to be seen.

a4df4ca6,"After years of writing in and petitioning, a group in Atlanta, Georgia, has finally made some progress toward their goal: to replace all people of color in prisons with white people. It hasn’t been an easy road, and many times, the group known as End Black Imprisonment EBI has been arrested themselves for their acts of defiance. However, it was during that time that they realized a compromise could be made.  It was getting arrested that gave us an epiphany. What if, instead of going into the system involuntarily, we could sub in for a POC instead? They could go out, maybe work at our jobs and live in our houses, if they need a place to stay, and show that they are upstanding citizens? Shana Fisher, EBI spokesperson  This no-longer radical idea was presented to the courts by the group’s lawyer, and after several days of deliberation, the judge agreed that it would be doable. It would be a work-release program, except that the prison wouldn’t be losing an individual fit to continue that prisoner’s labor. The group began drafting willing white members of the community to help begin the exchange process.  The first few white people to be exchanged were admitted to the prison, followed by the group and a photographer. As they entered, they saw three black prisoners standing in the processing area with their hands in cuffs. They were shown the three men who would take their places, un-cuffed, and given a satchel which contained their personal affects, some cash, and the addresses to the home of the person they were exchanging with.  All men immediately departed, presumably so elated with their newfound freedom that they forgot to thank the men taking their places, and the white men were placed in cuffs to begin their sentences. They were led away, and all three were smiling and giddy as they disappeared down the hallway.  How can you begin the process to become part of the exchange? First, you’ll need to live in Atlanta. To help combat these limitations, EBI has repurposed an old motel into a half-way house for anyone who doesn’t live in the area so that a local address can be provided. From there, you’ll need to fill out some forms and get on the waiting list to be matched with an available person of color. We’re told that the waiting list is quite long, and could be months out at this point, so you’ll want to sign up soon to get ahead.

She stood to be tested regardless of symptoms while in custody, but her symptoms and the profile of this particular case caused local officials to speed up the testing practice,” a release from the US Department of Justice stated.  “It looks really bad,” one New Hampshire official told The Brown Valley Observer. “Her symptoms seem advanced at this point and ultimately she will probably end up requiring a ventilator, more likely sooner than later.”  Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire Thursday morning in connection with Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring. Court papers related to her indictment allege that Maxwell was involved in the sexual abuse and trafficking of girls as young as 14 years old. She has faced allegations and previous charges related to her role as a procurer for Epstein’s alleged “sex island”  Coronavirus testing in jails is currently a standard practice in New Hampshire, with all newly arrested inmates tested before release into general population or otherwise moving or extraditing the inmate.

The recount of the presidential election in Wisconsin's two most heavily Democratic counties began Friday with President Donald Trump's campaign seeking to discard tens of thousands of absentee ballots that it alleged should not have been counted. AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh  MADISON, Wis. AP — The recount of the presidential election in Wisconsin’s two most heavily Democratic counties began Friday with President Donald Trump’s campaign seeking to discard tens of thousands of absentee ballots that it alleged should not have been counted.  Trump’s three objections attempting to discard the ballots were denied by the three-member Dane County Board of Canvassers, twice on bipartisan votes. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said he expected the campaign was building a record before filing a lawsuit.  Joe Biden won Wisconsin by 20,600 votes and carried Dane and Milwaukee counties by a 2-to-1 margin . Trump only paid for recounts in those two counties, not in the 70 others, 58 of which he won.  There’s no precedent for a recount overturning a deficit as large as Trump’s in Wisconsin, so his strategy is widely seen as seeking to build a case to take to court.  His team on Friday sought to have ballots discarded where election clerks filled in missing address information on the certification envelope where the ballot is inserted; any absentee ballot where a voter declared themselves to be “indefinitely confined” under the law; and any absentee ballot where there was not a written application on file, including roughly 69,000 that were cast in-person during the two weeks before Election Day.  Trump attorney Christ Troupis argued that certification envelopes filled out by people who voted absentee in-person do not count under the law as a written application, even though the envelope is identified as such. The board of canvassers, controlled 2-1 by Democrats, voted unanimously to reject the complaint.  Troupis also argued that people claimed to be indefinitely confined even though they were not. Such a declaration exempts the voter from having to show a photo ID to cast their ballot, which Troupis called “an open invitation for fraud and abuse.” The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court this spring ruled that it is up to individual voters to determine whether they are indefinitely confined, in line with guidance from the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission.  The canvassing board voted 2-1 to count those ballots, with the Republican opposed.  ADVERTISEMENT  Trump’s attorney also claimed that the law does not allow clerks to fill in missing information on the envelope that goes with absentee ballots. The state elections commission told clerks before the election that they can fill in missing information on the absentee ballot envelopes, a practice that has been in place for at least the past 11 elections.  The canvassing board voted unanimously to count those ballots.  In Milwaukee, the canvassing board agreed to Trump’s request to set aside all absentee ballot envelopes where voters claimed “indefinitely confined” status and those with two different colors of ink, perhaps indicating that someone other than the voter completed the information.  A Trump challenge in Milwaukee to reject and not count absentee ballots in envelops altered by clerk staff to fix addresses or other errors was dismissed by election officials, Biden campaign attorney, Danielle Friedman, said in a call with reporters Friday night.  In limited counting so far, she said the vote tally for Biden has changed little, adding there have been “no changes on the scale that would change the result” and that “the Trump campaign seems aware of that fact.”  “They’re not actually interested in recounting the votes,” she said.  Although the ballots in altered envelopes would be counted, they will still be segregated. It’s a move to keep such ballots separated in case of potential legal challenges in coming days.  Trump also asked to separate absentee ballots with or without written applications and to observe absentee ballot logs that would account for those requested through the state’s myvote.wi.gov website. Unlike in Dane County, Trump’s campaign in Milwaukee initially asked only to review those ballots and others, not to have them discounted.  In both Madison and Milwaukee, the recounts were taking place in large convention centers so workers could be distanced to protect against spreading the coronavirus. Observers were required to wear masks and plexiglass shields were aset up.  Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson, a Democrat, said it was irresponsible of Trump to force the recount amid the pandemic that is surging in Wisconsin .  “It just shows his lack of empathy toward the American people,” Christenson said.  In Milwaukee, the Rev. Greg Lewis, founding president of groups of faith leaders who sought to bolster Black turnout, said the recount highlights the “oppression, disenfranchisement, downright racism and disrespect” that minority communities in Milwaukee face.  “I almost died and we are running around here counting votes unnecessarily,” said Lewis, who contracted COVID-19 earlier this year. “This is nonsense. This is pitiful. Why do we keep putting up with this? The people have decided, let it be.”  There have been at least 31 recounts in statewide elections in the U.S. since the most famous one in Florida’s presidential election in 2000.

The ads are being paid for by the Federation for American Immigration Reform FAIR, a national nonpartisan organization that supports enforcement of U.S. immigration laws and overall reductions in immigration to restore a fair labor market for all. The Wisconsin ad buy is over $200,000 and is the next phase of a growing seven figure ad campaign to appear around the country. FAIR has already invested nearly $1 million in radio and TV spots in the first half of 2013 alone. Similar ads will soon appear elsewhere.  The 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee has become a prominent voice in support of granting amnesty to illegal aliens and dramatically increasing future immigration to avert a looming labor shortage in the United States. The ads challenge Ryan to justify his support for massive immigration increases in light of chronically high unemployment across Wisconsin and even in his own congressional district.  Ryan's advocacy for amnesty and immigration increases has intensified as unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin. In June, unemployment increased in 30 of the state's 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state's 72 counties.  Congressman Ryan needs to explain to thousands of Wisconsin workers, who are struggling to find jobs to support their families, why he wants to increase immigration in order to avert a labor shortage that clearly does not exist, stated Dan Stein, president of FAIR.

Amy Klobuchar D as having “declined to prosecute” Derek Chauvin over a 2006 police-involved shooting while she served as Hennepin County’s top prosecutor from 1999 to 2007. As clarified by the Hennepin County attorney’s office on Friday, “Sen. Klobuchar’s last day in the office here was December 31 2006, and she had no involvement in the prosecution of this case at all.” Klobuchar likewise addressed the claim Friday, describing it as “absolutely false” in an interview with MSNBC. This article has been revised to reflect this correction and include Klobuchar’s response.  In an interview with MSNBC on Friday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar D — one of the leading names on presumptive Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden’s vice presidential list — refuted the claim that while serving as Hennepin County’s top prosecutor from 1999 to 2007 she declined to prosecute the officer charged Friday over the death of George Floyd.  Floyd died on Monday after an arrest that involved four Minneapolis police officers. One of the officers, Derek Chauvin, is seen in a video taken by a bystander as holding his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes while Floyd tells the officers he cannot breathe. The four officers were fired on Tuesday and Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday on 3rd-degree murder and manslaughter charges for the death of George Floyd.  Amid scrutiny over her former office’s handling of a 2006 case against Chauvin, Klobuchar slammed the claim that she “declined” to prosecute.  “This idea that I somehow declined a case, which has been reported on some news blogs … against this officer is absolutely false,” the senator told MSNBC Friday, as reported by The Hill. “That investigation continued into a time where I was already sworn into the U.S. Senate,” Klobuchar explained. “It was handled and sent to the grand jury by my successor.”  “I never declined [Chauvin’s] case,” she said. “It was handled and sent to the grand jury. When I was county attorney, cases we had involving officer-involved shootings went to a grand jury. I think that was wrong, now. It would have been much better if I took responsibility and looked at cases and made a decision myself.”  Klobuchar’s assertion was confirmed by the Hennepin County attorney’s office on Friday. “Sen. Klobuchar’s last day in the office here was December 31 2006, and she had no involvement in the prosecution of this case at all,” the office said in a statement.  Klobuchar’s record as prosecutor has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the tragic death of Floyd. The claim that she declined charges against Chauvin followed a report by The Guardian on Chauvin’s police record published Thursday.  In the report, the outlet highlights a 2006 officer-involved shooting case in which Chauvin was one of the officers named in a complaint, and which occurred while Klobuchar was still serving as the county’s top prosecutor.  “Between 1999 and 2007, Klobuchar, the state’s then top prosecutor, declined to press charges against more than a dozen officers accused of killing civilians,” The Guardian reported Thursday. “In 2006, Chauvin was one of several officers involved in the shooting death of a man who stabbed others before turning on the police. Although Klobuchar was the Hennepin county attorney at the time of an October 2006 police shooting involving Chauvin, she did not prosecute and instead the case went to a grand jury that declined to charge the officers with wrongdoing in 2008.”  WXII 12 News reported Thursday that Chauvin “had 18 prior complaints filed against him with the Minneapolis Police Department’s Internal Affairs.”  Klobuchar’s record as a prosecutor came under fire while she was campaigning for president earlier this year after The Associated Press reportedly uncovered new evidence in an investigation into the death of an 11-year-old girl who was killed by a stray bullet while she was at home.  “The senator has repeatedly highlighted Mr. [Myon] Burrell’s conviction in the 2002 case, in which an 11-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet, as evidence of her history of being tough on crime and seeking justice for African-American communities shaken by gun violence,” The New York Times reported. “But the A.P. article quoted one of Mr. Burrell’s co-defendants as saying that he was in fact the gunman responsible for the murder of the girl, Tyesha Edwards. Mr. Burrell, The A.P. reported, has insisted that he is innocent and has rejected all plea deals.”  The Washington Post highlighted another racially charged case that Klobuchar declined to bring charges in that involved the death of 44-year-old Christopher Burns, an unarmed black man, who died after he was put in a choke hold by law enforcement officers who were responding to a domestic violence call.  “The focus of the community’s anger was Amy Klobuchar, the up-and-coming attorney of Hennepin County, who had declined to prosecute police accused of using excessive force against black suspects,” The Washington Post reported. “At the same time, she aggressively prosecuted smaller offenses such as vandalism and routinely sought longer-than-recommended sentences, including for minors.”  At the beginning of March, while she was still running for president, Klobuchar had to cancel a campaign rally in Minnesota after a large number of protesters stormed the stage demanding that she drop out of the race due to her record as a prosecutor.

6012c7ac,"The Food and Drug Administration FDA declared teen e-cigarette use an epidemic today, threatening to slap manufacturers including Juul with crushing fines if they don't present plans to curb sales to minors.  As of 2017, more than two million high school-age Americans used e-cigarettes, a trend that represents a historic uptake of nicotine products, the FDA said.  Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that he believes flavored vape liquids target teenagers specifically and his agency is considering banning them altogether.  The FDA has given five companies - Vuse, Blu, JuuL, MarkTen XL, and Logic- 60 days to come up with a plan to keep teenagers from using its devices and sent warning letters to 1,300 companies that it caught selling the device to minors.  The FDA is threatening Juul an other e-cigarette makers with crippling fines if they don't come up with plans to curb sales to minors in an announcement calling teenage vaping an 'epidemic'  While e-cigarettes were first marketed to help adults quit smoking combustible cigarettes, they have now become a gateway to nicotine for teenagers.  The Juul in particular resembles a USB drive, making it easy for teenagers to hide and even bring to school.  Since the surge in teen use of the products began, the FDA and Juul have battled over the products consistently.  Now, Gottlieb is coordinating the largest scale initiative to enforce regulations against selling e-cigarettes to-date.  'We see clear signs that youth use of electronic cigarettes has reached an epidemic proportion,' he said in today's announcement.  Gottlieb reiterated his belief that certain e-cigarette liquid flavors - including sweet ones such as mango and cucumber, popular among teenage Juul users - are particularly enticing and even marketed directly to children.  Budding research on e-cigarettes also suggests that these flavors contain terpenes that may be more damaging to the lungs than other flavors are.  Other studies have indicated that while e-cigarettes may have milder effects on the lungs, they are just as bad - if not worse - for the cardiovascular system, raising risks of heart disease and high blood pressure.  What's more, e-cigarette liquids like Juul pods contain high concentrations of nicotine.  The company recently released new pods that are three percent nicotine, as opposed to the original, potent five percent ones, but in many places these have yet to hit shelves.  These levels of nicotine are highly addictive, particularly to the developing brains of children and teenagers.  Gottlieb noted that the FDA continues to support the availability of products to help adult smokers quit, but 'that work can’t come at the expense of kids,' he said.  Studies published in the last couple of years have suggested that e-cigarettes may in fact act like a gateway to nicotine and other drugs for adolescents, and Gottlieb and the FDA intend to shut those gates, by force, if necessary.  The agency is now demanding plans to reign in youth-targeted marketing campaigns and control illegal sales of their products to minors from Juul and four other e-cigarette makers within 60 days.  'We won’t allow the current trends in youth access and use to continue, even if it means putting limits in place that reduce adult uptake of these products,' Gottlieb said.","Teen vaping is an 'epidemic,' FDA declares - blaming Juuls for fueling teen addiction crisis",partially false

d77b2489,"A few weeks ago, I stopped by Portland State University to talk with students about the cost of a college education and the debt that is weighing down our students. I walked in to find a room full of students holding yellow balloons with numbers on them that depict the amount of student debt they are expecting to have upon graduation.  The numbers written on those balloons, anywhere from $18,000 to $90,000, were staggering — and a clear demonstration that the price of higher education is much too high.  Our college students face higher costs and greater debt at the same time that it is more imperative to get a good education to succeed in the work force. In Oregon today, the average debt upon college graduation is more than $24,000, with many students in debt $50,000 to $100,000.  Making college affordable is one of the best investments we can make to grow our economy. We should do everything we can to make America a magnet for jobs, ensure our workers have the skills they need to compete, and help Americans get ahead.  If we are to succeed in the 21st century, we need to ensure that our kids can afford the best education possible. But Congress is failing to tackle this issue. A vote to keep student loan rates at 3.4 percent, rather than letting rates double to 6.8 percent on July 1, was defeated by a minority filibuster. This increase will impact every Oregon student securing a new Stafford loan. This is unacceptable.  No one should believe that keeping student loan rates low is unaffordable. The U.S. government will make a profit of more than $50 billion on student loans this coming year. Running up big profits at the expense of our students is just wrong.  Moreover, affordable financing is an issue of setting national priorities. We are spending $120 billion this year in Afghanistan. We must end that war. And as we do, we should invest a big share of those resources in education. Indeed, we should pass the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act that would give students the same rock-bottom interest rates big banks get from the Fed. The biggest banks in the country pay less than 1 percent on funds they borrow from the government. Why should our students pay nine times as much?  Higher education is the surest path to middle-class success and economic opportunity. The last thing we should do at a time when Americans owe more on student loans than credit cards is to make student loans more expensive. That’s why I’ll continue fighting to pass the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, and help reduce the numbers on those yellow balloons.  Our students deserve the opportunity to get the best education in the world without ending up with debt the size of a home mortgage.  It’s clear from my recent visit with those Portland State students that we’ve got a lot of talent here in Oregon. Let’s make sure our talented students can afford a college education to realize their dreams and potential and help build the future economy.  U.S. Sen.

Watch below timestamp 2:35 – Partial transcript: “…The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people. Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly. “Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that. “So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges – you know pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard, and that actual decision of ‘okay, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world,’ governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”","WATCH: Bill Gates Admits His COVID-19 Vaccine Might KILL Nearly 1,000,000 People – The Clover Chronicle",FALSE

ec992d76,"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.  The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency ICE issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.  Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.  Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.  Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.  Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency ICE detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.  The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.  The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”  According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.  Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population.

Howard Simon, Executive Director of the ACLU of Florida, responded to the decision with the following statement:  “No one should be surprised that the U.S. Supreme Court will not permit the Florida legislature to impose the death penalty contrary to what Justice Kennedy declared “our nation's commitment to dignity and its duty to teach human decency as the mark of a civilized world.    “The Supreme Court is telling Florida leaders — who passed the unconstitutional law allowing for the execution of Freddie Hall — that if you want to impose the death penalty, it must be done in a way that respects standards of decency and basic human rights.    “This is not the first time the Legislature has ignored standards of decency set by the U.S. Supreme Court and it likely will not be the last. The strict IQ rule struck down by the Supreme Court today is just one example of the many ways in which our state’s death penalty system falls short of constitutional and human rights standards. We should expect the Supreme Court to take more control over Florida’s death penalty system in the future.    “Florida’s death penalty system is broken, and if state leaders wish to continue sentencing people to die, they must address that system’s failings. Florida is the only state in the country where the vote of a simple majority of jurors can recommend that a person receive a sentence of death. This has contributed to our state’s record of having the most errors and exonerations from death row.    “Unless the Legislature fixes the system by which death can be imposed by the vote of a simple majority, it is likely that the Court will take that – and more -- out of their hands.

William Smith, 28, was discovered in the early hours of Tuesday morning, decapitated and slumped against the front door of the judge who had granted him bail in August.  Smith was arrested last month following allegations by his then girlfriend that he had raped her 8-year-old daughter.  After a police investigation in which Smith was found in possession of child pornography, he was arrested on two counts related to child pornography and one count of child molestation. After being charged, Smith walked free from the court after the judge controversially ruled that he did not pose a threat to the local community, and he raised the $30,000 bail required to trigger his freedom.  The alleged victim’s family said they were “shocked” that Smith had been allowed to walk free from court. Smith was awaiting trial for his crimes and was awaiting a court date which was due to be scheduled for later this year, however it seems that somebody from the local  community decided to take matters into their own hands.

When he went outside to find out what his dog was barking about, he found the decapitated body of the man he had allowed to walk free slumped against his front door with the severed head left on the steps.  Investigating officers described his death scene as resembling a “gangland-style execution“.  A local resident said of the horrific discovery that finding a headless body was an “unusual” occurrence: “This is a nice area.This is the kind of thing that usually happens in mob films, but not around here.”  Police say they are currently “following leads” but have yet to make any arrests for the murder.

He died peacefully while under anesthesia on the operating table, at the full age of 80.  Majors was best known for his casting as Steve Austin in the popular 70’s television crime drama “The Six Million Dollar Man,” about an accident victim who receives robotic body parts to give him super speed, strength, hearing, and vision. The popularity of this show launched the rest of his very successful career.  Who should become president of USA in 2020?

He was also a devoted Christian, who supported many religious charities, and a lifelong member of the Republican Party. He never swayed from his support of the GOP, saying that the party’s values were “in line with his own in regard to God, family, religion, and wealth. Republicans are the party Jesus would vote for.”  This loyalty explains the beneficiaries of his last will and testament, namely, his own church as well as the campaign to re-elect President Trump. Majors left 66% of his sizeable $9 million estate to Trump 2020 – a symbolic total of $6 million. An excerpt from his will showed his love for our President:  “President Trump has shown the leadership and strength that this country has lacked for decades.

b9bf498d,"0 SHARES Share Tweet BLM pasted these “rules” for “white folks” attending protests on social media. Many whites wanted to stand in unity with their fellow blacks to protest the unjust killing of George Floyd’s. In a moment of unity, these rules seem more degrading and racist towards white people. Among some of the rules, they request whites to “stay in the back until you are called forward. If you hear “White people to the front” or “Allies to the front” step forward and link arms with other white people to form a human shield.” So they asked that all whites stay in the back and link arms with other whites, not blacks. Seems those that are crying for equality don’t want equality, they want superiority over whites. Unity is when we unite side by side together in a common goal. So why would they not use this moment to show that we can all one? BLM Mohawk Kuzma said this in 2014: “As organizer of the largest Black Lives Matter marches in Seattle since 2014, Mohawk Kuzma has had a front-row seat to the transforming demographics of the BLM movement. He says that my eyes are not deceiving me. There is a noticeable increase of white marchers, one that he says signifies that white Seattleites’ long hibernation on Black issues is at its end. “The reason BLM marches are getting more white is because more white people are waking up and seeing the covert segregation and racial injustice and racism,” Kuzma tells me. “We see it on the news every day across the nation.” He draws a connection with the overt displays of racism, from pervasive police killings of blacks to the recent domestic terrorist acts by white supremacists, most recently a school shooting by one in New Mexico Kuzma says that when he began organizing he welcomed whatever race, gender, or orientation felt compelled to attend, as long as the marchers understood “that all black lives matter and racial injustice, police brutality, and racism needed to stop.” However, he also recognizes that the increased numbers of white folks is a double-edged sword. “More white people also brings white ignorance and white fragility,” he says. “White people think they have to be respectful during a protest. Sorry, but we as black people don’t get respect from anyone, including white people, so why should we be respectful. We are here to get stuff done.” During the Civil War, it was white people that fought for the freedom of slaves. At that time the north had 22 million people against slavery while the south had 9 million. 4 million of them were slaves. It was white people that ran the underground railroad. It has always true that more white people are fighting for equal rights than not. Though many seem to want to overlook this historical fact. This movement is an American movement and we should have mutual respect for each other. We should treat each other how we expect to be treated.

2563d5d5,"Update: some have asked why I didn’t sign my name to this post. The answer is simple: the intended audience was our rural membership and they all know me.  As I write to you today, I have no doubt that this letter will find many of you crushed under the weight of despair or perhaps lost in a maze of confusion. It is my hope that by the time you finish reading this letter you will be able to confidently join millions of others who support the president and another four years.  Let me be clear: Trump will be president for another four years. Biden will not be president. Yes, I know those are shocking words in these crazy days.  I have been approached by many saying, “It’s over…” and “Trump conceded the election…”. Nothing of the sort has taken place. Go back and listen to the videos all the way through. At no point does Trump even mention Biden’s name. At no point does he say he concedes. He does say that there will be a peaceful transition to a new administration and he does say that this is only the beginning. Those phrases are important to note. Indeed, we will have a new administration made up of a new vice president and cabinet as the current ones have all made their treason complete. I will touch on this in more detail shortly.  We do well to remember that for more than four years Donald Trump has been five steps ahead of everyone in every attempt to derail him, impeach him, or confound him. For example, he announced on election night in the early hours of the morning that he “didn’t want a dump of ballots at 4AM.” What happened in just a few short hours at almost exactly 4AM? A huge ballot dump took place which showed that he already knew that it was going to take place. That was a public word to the enemies of our country that he was on to them. Also, consider the recent incident at the capitol building in DC. Trump was late to his speaking engagement and then spoke on a number of rehashed things to the crowd of 500K+ but this created a problem. You see, if Trump had spoken on time and briefly, the MAGA crowd would have been at the capitol building with the Antifa faction and likely would have been drawn into the fray by accident and confusion due to the crowd size. With Trump speaking late and long, the MAGA crowd was PROTECTED and SEPARATED from the Antifa groups. It would be very clear that the disguised Antifa people were 95%+ of the people in the building. Again, Trump countered because he was steps ahead of them. This was clearly a staged event meant to blame Trump supporters and try to frame Trump so the 25th amendment could be used by Congress but it failed. Nevermind the numerous videos showing the police opening the gates for Antifa they didn’t fight their way in and then leading them throughout the building.  I say all this as only two examples out of many that at no point has our president been in a fight of desperation.  Now you may ask, “Why hasn’t Trump arrested anyone yet? Why did this have to go all the way to Congress?” Multiple reasons: first, Trump has been adamant in following the rule of law and the Constitution. He gives everyone, no matter how dirty, an opportunity to do the right thing sometimes with warnings such as the phone call with the Georgia Secretary of State recently. He pushed cases through the courts, he presented evidence to the legislatures, and he even told the vice president to do the right thing. But with the betrayal by Pence and Congress, the treason is now complete and nobody can say that Trump did not allow the process to finish before acting. Second, in order to drain the swamp you have to know who are the swamp creatures. They can blend in very well with the crowds. But the false event in the capitol revealed the final traitors for who they were regardless of party affiliation. Trump flushed them out of hiding.  I need to take a moment to speak on Pence. With his treason completed, many of you may not know of his dealings and political posturing prior to the infamous day in the capitol. Pence was already wheeling and dealing way back during the 2016 election season with…wait for it….Paul Ryan. Remember Ryan? The RINO speaker of the house? Look at these emails that were recently revealed:  Pence was also involved with a scheme to oust Trump sometime during his first four years that was orchestrated by Rod Rosenstein and supported by the Clintons. The plan: get rid of Trump, become president and then appoint Rod Rosenstein as the new VP. Why would they want that? Because they felt Pence could be controlled. See these links for the 3 part series for more information:  More could be said but I don’t want this letter to become more of a book than it already is. Suffice it to say that when Trump said at the DC rally that he hoped Pence would do the right thing, he already knew what he was going to do but was, yet again, giving the man space to choose to do the right thing.  Now, nobody has been more supportive of Trump than Lin Wood. This man’s career has been fighting defamation lawsuits which means that he doesn’t say things, no matter how outrageous they may seem, without them being true as he knows the consequences of slander. With this in mind, Lin Wood has become a fountain of information and leaks of hitherto unknown information revealing some of the depths of corruption and evil in our highest offices. This is the same man who recently said that arrests are coming over the next few days. He called Pence a traitor well before the counting of the elector votes on the 6th. But did you know that he also said that the president, following the capitol incident, left DC on a “Doomsday” aircraft used for communications in the event of a nuclear war with his family and was in Abilene, TX. This aircraft was confirmed by both flight trackers and eyes on the ground. In short, he is a trustworthy source of information. If you have a means to follow Lin Wood on Parler, I would highly recommend that you do so to stay abreast of things taking place. You can also listen to this podcast: Podcast  So, what comes next? I don’t have the particulars but I can give you milestones to watch for as the coming days unfold:  Expect the emergency broadcast system to be activated. The FCC just recently released a memorandum speaking to the requirements under Federal law to send messages from the president to the public. See this link Expect confusion. We are in a battle for our republic against elites that are attempting the very coup that they are accusing Trump of doing. In battle, there will be disinformation but know that plans are being fulfilled. Expect high profile arrests to take place over the next 12 days and at any time. You may wake one morning to find someone in high office is no longer there. Expect this to be a bumpy ride to the very end. This is not a television show where things are resolved in 45 minutes. Expect more bombshell evidence to be released between now and Jan. 20th. Expect some sort of internet blackout or outage: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Gmail are likely going to be affected. If you don’t have alternate forms of communication established now, it would be a good idea to start forming them even if it’s just checking on your nextdoor neighbors. Expect Trump to be inaugurated on Jan 20th! Expect the executive order from 2018 and/or the Insurrection Act to be enacted. This DOES NOT mean martial law. Remember that we have been under a state of emergency since 2018 which gives the president many powers to act.  These things may happen out of the order listed and some may happen multiple times. As I have been watching closely, many things have been and are in play as we speak. Remember that Trump has not and will not give up. He actually takes his oath of office to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic very seriously. This is why they are so panicked in DC: they know that Trump will fight while Congress just rolls over.  I’ve mentioned this before but it bears repeating. None of us would have believed what we all now know except that Trump and his team have painstakingly taken the time to show the public. Want to show what Congress thinks of you? Highlight that the stimulus bill only sent $600 to each American but billions to other countries payoffs, money laundering. Want to show the extent of collusion with the CCP at all levels of government? Bring multiple lawsuits against the election fraud from the local courts all the way to the Supreme Court which will show just how brazenly treasonous the judges are. Want the public to see how rigged the election system has been for many years? Present the evidence openly as we have seen. Even this week we have sworn testimony out of Italy that the Leonardo defense contractor used satellites to change the votes from our election in the USA from Italy. These Dominion voting machines were actively sending data to Germany, Serbia, China, Iran, and now Rome. This corruption is MUCH bigger than any of us expected but none of us would have believed it until now. This is why things seem to have taken so long.  Now, the American public is awake and ready to take back their long forgotten responsibilities to hold the elected officials accountable. I have heard from many of you how upset you are with the obvious and willful disregard for the truth and for justice.  As the days unfold, let’s maintain communications among ourselves and try to help our neighbor to understand what is happening. Turn off the television as they have demonstrated they are clearly only falsifying the media to maintain control over your thinking. Do not despair but pray for our country, for Trump and his supporters, and for a national repentance to be stirred nationwide.  The next 12 days will be something to tell the grandchildren!

Now, her list of accolades can include jet-setting billionaire, as Forbes magazine has recently named her the 18th richest woman on the planet. Assuming the planet was an alternate Earth.  According to several experts wearing ties and carrying briefcases in my imagination, the youngest Clinton has parlayed her savings into a number of profitable investments including organic apple-marijuana farming, a frozen line of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and ownership of a company responsible for building complex Christian-head-cutter-offer machines for Fema when the time comes.

Upon the launch of the ads, the Republican Party of Wisconsin is releasing the following statement from Executive Director Mark Morgan:  “Whether it’s Tony Evers failing families, Matt Flynn bullying victims of sexual abuse, Mahlon Mitchell abusing his position, or Kelda Roys putting families in danger, Democrats are locked into a dangerous race to the left.

Listen to the ads below:  “Failed,” On Tony Evers Failing Families:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As Superintendent of Schools, Tony Evers sided with union bosses and failed to take the license of a teacher who was found to be spreading pornography at school and making inappropriate comments about the bodies of middle school girls – despite outcry from parents.  In a similar case from before he was an elected official, Evers signed off on a license revocation for a teacher watching pornography at school – showing Evers failed to consistently implement the law and that his excuses for inaction on previous cases ring hollow.  “Silent,” On Matt Flynn Bullying Victims of Abuse:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As a defense attorney, Flynn threatened to throw victims of sexual abuse “crumbs.”  A letter unveiled by the Republican Party of Wisconsin detailed how Flynn provided sexual predators with direct legal counsel.  Despite all of this, most of his fellow Democrat candidates for governor have failed to call on Flynn to drop out of the race.  “Abusing,” On Mahlon Mitchell Abusing His Position:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As a union boss, Mahlon Mitchell took a massive raise on the backs of hard-working Wisconsin firefighters.

2427fce3,"In a stunning development, a former Chief Science Officer for the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer says there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen. The Big Pharma insider asserts that false positive results from inherently unreliable COVID tests are being used to manufacture a second wave based on new cases.  Dr. Mike Yeadon, a former Vice President and Chief Science Officer for Pfizer for 16 years, says that half or even almost all of tests for COVID are false positives. Dr. Yeadon also argues that the threshold for herd immunity may be much lower than previously thought, and may have been reached in many countries already.  In an interview last week Dr. Yeadon was asked:  we are basing a government policy, an economic policy, a civil liberties policy, in terms of limiting people to six people in a meeting...all based on, what may well be, completely fake data on this coronavirus?  Dr. Yeadon answered with a simple yes.  Even more significantly, even if all positives were to be correct, Dr. Yeadon said that given the shape of all important indicators in a worldwide pandemic, such as hospitalizations, ICU utilization, and deaths, the pandemic is fundamentally over.  Yeadon said in the interview:  Were it not for the test data that you get from the TV all the time, you would rightly conclude that the pandemic was over, as nothing much has happened. Of course people go to the hospital, moving into the autumn flu season...but there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.  In a paper published this month, which was co-authored by Yeadon and two of his colleagues, How Likely is a Second Wave?, the scientists write:  It has widely been observed that in all heavily infected countries in Europe and several of the US states likewise, that the shape of the daily deaths vs. time curves is similar to ours in the UK. Many of these curves are not just similar, but almost super imposable.  In the data for UK, Sweden, the US, and the world, it can be seen that in all cases, deaths were on the rise in March through mid or late April, then began tapering off in a smooth slope which flattened around the end of June and continues to today. The case rates however, based on testing, rise and swing upwards and downwards wildly.

Trump, the presumptive nominee, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican and thus chairman of the convention. But it offers just a sample of the spectacles sure to ensue between them should Mr. Trump become president.  How could Mr. Ryan, for years his party’s self-styled ideas guy, share power with a president whose ill-formed, often baffling ideas are in significant cases the opposite of his own, and of conservatives generally — on trade, Medicare and Social Security, immigration policy and more?  Could Mr. Ryan, as he suggests, really expect compromise from Mr. Trump, who has already served notice that Republican congressional leaders should “just be quiet” and leave running the country to him? Might Mr. Ryan even use the House’s legislative power to block some initiatives, though President Trump would be certain to claim a mandate for them? Where difficult trade-offs are needed to bring Trumpian ideas into legislative reality, can Mr. Ryan corral support from his fractious Republican colleagues and even a few Democrats when necessary?  That last question suggests another, bigger one that predates the Trump ascendance: Can Mr. Ryan himself compromise in the interest of getting legislation signed into law?

2ae2f621,"The government has introduced what it claims to be the biggest package of workplace reforms for 20 years after concerns that ministers have failed to appeal to voters who are “just about managing”.  Legislation that comes into effect on Monday will increase fines for employers who have deliberately victimised their staff, and give workers details of their rights from the first day in their job.  The reforms, outlined by the business secretary Greg Clark, plan to stop the “unfair” use of pay-between-assignment contracts which allow businesses to opt out of equal pay arrangements for agency employees. Measures will also be taken to ensure that seasonal workers get the paid time off they are entitled to.  The reforms will be seen as a direct appeal to Labour voters and an attempt to get back to the values expressed by Theresa May in July 2016. In her first speech as prime minister, May said: “If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security.” She pledged to protect those who were “just about managing”.  Labour has questioned whether the plans will do anything for people on zero-hours contracts. Unions said the reforms were a missed opportunity to rebalance power in the gig economy.  The reforms, covered in a report called the Good Work Plan, are based on the recommendations made by former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor in his review into employment, especially in the so-called gig economy. The government has pledged to implement 51 of Taylor’s suggested 53 reforms.  Legislation will be introduced to give workers details of their rights from the first day in a job, such as eligibility for sick leave, pay levels, maternity and paternity leave.  The maximum employment tribunal fines for employers demonstrated to have shown malice, spite or gross oversight will increase from £5,000 to £20,000.  Ministers are also committing to legislate to improve employment status tests to “reflect the reality of the modern working relationships”. Despite calls from unions, the government said the reforms would not ban zero-hours contracts, in keeping with Taylor’s recommendations, because that would “negatively impact” more people than it helped.  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady welcomed some reforms such as the decision to scrap the so-called “agency worker loophole”.  However, Grady said the government had missed an opportunity to bolster the rights of zero-hours workers. “These reforms as a whole won’t shift the balance of power in the gig economy. Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.  “The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right at all. Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist,” she said.  Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow business secretary, said the reforms will do little to combat the government’s attacks on workers’ rights such as an increase in employment tribunal fees, the Trade Union Act and low wage growth.  “These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero-hours contracts and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights they’ll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers,” she said.  The government claims the reforms will make the UK the first country in the world to address the opportunities and challenges of the gig economy and its impact on a modern economy.  They form a key part of the government’s modern industrial strategy, a long-term plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs in every part of the UK.  Clark said: “The world of work is changing, bringing new opportunities for innovative businesses and new business models to flourish, creating jobs across the country and boosting our economy.  “Today’s largest upgrade in workers’ rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.”  Taylor told the Guardian: “I think this is a welcome and substantive response from the government and will make a real difference to the working lives of millions of workers, particularly those in the most vulnerable positions.”  One business representative broadly welcomed the suggested reforms. Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: “Businesses support a strong floor of workplace rights, and it’s right that these laws keep pace with changes in the economy and society.  “They welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.  “However, legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future,” he said.",Workers get new rights in overhaul but zero-hours contracts remain,FALSE
0b348ddd,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This story about Chinese Communist Party influence in U.S. elections is currently being suppressed by Facebook’s fact-checker “Lead Stories” which recently announced a partnership with the Chinese Communist Party-linked app TikTok.  Lead Stories is run by former CNN staf f, managed from Belgium, and their staff donate almost exclusively to Democratic Party candidates. Our original story continues below, unchanged, and factually accurate.  Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi confirmed this weekend that “China would prefer Joe Biden” to win the upcoming presidential election. The news follows months of National Pulse reporting linking the Democratic Presidential candidate to the Chinese Communist Party.  During an exchange on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Pelosi effectively confirmed a National Counterintelligence and Security Center NCSC report which concluded China “prefers President Trump doesn’t win re-election.”  The news will take the wind out of the sails of the left’s claims that President Trump has not been tough on China, and plants Joe Biden squarely in Beijing’s corner in November:  “The Chinese… what they said is [that] China would prefer [Biden]. Whether they do, that’s their conclusion. That they would prefer Joe Biden.“  WATCH:  China would prefer Joe Biden. – Nancy Pelosi pic.twitter.com/gI1RHmFNOu — Francis Brennan @FrancisBrennan August 9, 2020  Pelosi also failed to disavow the foreign election interference occurring at the hands of China – a hypocritical stance in light of her unfounded fearmongering over Russian interference in the 2016 election.  And the prospect of election interference at the hands of the CCP is considerably more likely.  As the NCSC’s report notes: “We assess that China prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China.”  The charges are not far-fetched.  While serving as Senator and Vice President, Biden championed trade deals and economic policies amenable to the Chinese Communist Party CCP and, as a private-sector continuation of Biden’s China appeasement, his family members have profited immensely from countless deals with CCP-run companies.",WATCH: Pelosi Confirms ‘China Would Prefer Joe Biden’,FALSE

The Bible has long been controversial when it comes to race, suggesting that Jesus Christ can break down barriers between people groups through the blood of His cross and callously proclaiming that everyone is made in God's image and has inherent dignity and worth because of God's infinite worth.  We're trying to stoke racial tensions, and the Bible is extremely unhelpful at a time like this, said one activist. Pulling the book will go a long way toward progressing the race war.

a5a086c7,"The extent to which low-paid workers in the UK stay trapped in poverty is highlighted by a report showing only one in four workers who were low-paid in 2001 – and who have remained in employment for most of the subsequent decade – went on to escape poverty and move on to higher pay.  The findings come in a report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank, requested by the government commission on social mobility.  The report finds that among the three-quarters of workers who were low-paid a decade ago, the majority cycled between low and higher pay over the course of the decade. Just 12% of those who stayed in employment were stuck in low pay every year of that decade.  The value of escaping low pay can be considerable, the report finds. The “escapers” saw their wages grow by an average 7.5% in real terms over the course of a decade, bringing their pay to around the level of typical workers. Those unable to escape low pay saw their wages grow half as fast at 3.6% a year in real terms.  Key characteristics of escapers include having or obtaining a degree, possessing a positive outlook for the future and working for a large employer defined as a company with 1,000-plus employees.  A key barrier to pay progression appears to be working part-time, alongside other factors such as being older, a single parent or disabled.  Workers also tend to stay on low pay if they are in specific industries, such as sales or hospitality. Fewer than one in five workers in the hospitality sector manage any serious pay progression.  The report looks at workers who were low paid in 2001, and who were in work for the majority of the subsequent decade, with at least three of those years being consecutive. An employee is judged to have escaped low pay if they were low paid in 2001 and moved on to wages above low pay in the final three years of the decade. Those who are stuck in low pay are defined as employees who were low paid in 2001 and have worked for the majority of the subsequent decade, but who have earned below the low-pay threshold in every year they have worked. The low-pay threshold is defined as two-thirds of median hourly earnings. In 2013, the threshold was £7.69.  Vidhya Alakeson, the deputy chief executive at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has a long-standing low-pay problem, with over a fifth of the workforce in poorly paid jobs. But the limited opportunities for escaping low pay is just as big a concern as it has huge consequences for people’s life chances.”  Alan Milburn, the chair of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said: “The majority of Britain’s poorest paid workers never escape the low-pay trap. Too many simply cycle in and out of low-paying jobs instead of being able to move up the pay ladder. Any sort of work is better than no work but being in a job does not guarantee a route out of poverty.  “This research provides compelling evidence for employers and government to do more on pay progression. It is a powerful argument for Britain to become a ‘living wage’ country.”  The CBI annual conference in London this week highlighted the squeeze on living standards and called for government measures to help the poorest in work, including cutting national insurance costs and helping potential workers who have very young children.  In a significant shift on Monday, Britain’s bosses called for action to tackle the living standards crisis, by lifting the lowest paid out of national insurance and expanding free childcare. The CBI also discussed what business could do to tackle low pay.  Sir Michael Rake, the CBI president, said: “Falling real wages – a price worth paying to preserve jobs during and after the recession – cannot go on for much longer. For those currently in low-paying jobs or trying for entry-level roles, business has to do much more to help them climb the ladder and progress. We want to see the benefits of a growing economy translated into better opportunities for all people.”  Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, told the CBI he thought the squeeze on living standards was a lagging indicator and would end soon. He said persistent low productivity in the UK was a puzzle and one reason for the slow rise in earnings may be due to the number of relatively low-paid young workers joining the employment market.",Low-paid workers unable to escape poverty trap - report,FALSE
ef0ab41b,"By Cassandra Fairbanks and Jim Hoft  On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes. This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: Schumer, McConnell Reach Agreement on Trump Impeachment Trial - Here Are the Details  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat present during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.

e47f8003,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Wednesday did not mince words on a congested conference call with Biden and federal health authorities who are seeking to prohibit domestic travel to and from the Sunshine State. DeSantis and Biden exchanged salvos of biting barbs after the criminal president said the federal government had authority to “restrict movement” of the people.  Citing concerns over the widespread proliferation of Covid-19 variants, Biden said he might have to prohibit vehicle and air traffic until the CDC and NIH were confident that currently available vaccinations had a proven efficacy against emerging strains, such as highly transmissible anomalies from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa.  Also on the call were “Deep State” Dr. Fauci and acting CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, both of whom championed Biden’s idea and told DeSantis that surging cases in Florida threatened to undermine the federal government’s expansive efforts to mitigate spread across the country. Florida, Dr. Fauci said, was the epicenter of Covid-19 mutations, and argued that new variants accounted for between 15-35% of new cases in Florida.  Walensky argued on the call that any attempt by DeSantis to resist a federally mandated travel ban would be immoral, selfish, and possibly illegal.  Biden echoed her words, and he berated DeSantis for having left Florida’s economy open during “the dark days of Covid.” Moreover, Biden claimed he had unilateral and constitutional authority to protect the nation’s health from “rogue politicians” acting in contravention of established health guidelines.  DeSantis’s initial reply was brief and blunt: “I will not comply,” he said, and then cited the CDC’s own statistics showing a nationwide decline in active Covid-19 cases.  Florida had arrested the spread of Covid-19, DeSantis argued, and accused Biden of targeting Republican states that supported Donald Trump.  “Florida absolutely will not comply,” DeSantis repeated. “Instituting a travel ban or restriction of movement would be a gross example of federal overreach with no grounding in law or science. We have Covid-19 in check, and you’re trying to exert unlawful authority over our state and its people,” he chided Biden.  Biden then tacitly threatened to withhold federal funding and to deny Florida access to Covid-19 vaccinations.  “C’mon, man, Florida needs our help, and you need vaccines, which are hard to come by, isn’t that right, Dr. Fauci,” Biden said.  The “Deep State” doctor replied in the affirmative, telling DeSantis that he expects the prevalence of the UK variant to double or triple every week to 10 days.  “Governor, do you want to be responsible for reinfecting the nation? Truth is, we don’t even know how effective current vaccines are against the UK strain.”  DeSantis told Dr. Fauci he trusted his own state health authorities over financially incentivized federal officials.  “How much do you stand to earn from these vaccines, Dr. Fauci? And, Joe, if you continue with this course of action, I will authorize the state National Guard to protect the movement of Floridians,” DeSantis said.  “Address me as Mr. President or President Biden,” Biden said.  “I will not, and you can go fuck yourself,” DeSantis said before hanging up.  In closing, it seems obvious that Team Biden favors perpetual lockdowns and a stagnant economy, keeping Americans imprisoned under a de facto state of medical martial law.

e3f7f045,"The United Nations just ordered the Trump administration to stand down in Portland!  This is what we have been warning about.  For over a month, the United Nations has been carrying out a 'human rights investigation' against the United States. First, they were investigating the US over systemic racism. They ordered the United States to crack down on police officers, otherwise the UN would mount an intervention. Yes, this is really what the UN Human Rights Council said last month…  When they learned that only 9 unarmed black people were shot by police last year, and of them, only two were not in the process of attacking a police officer or bystander, the UN shifted their strategy. They realized that they cannot launch a blue-helmet intervention on such a flimsy basis.  So, they shifted to investigating the Trump administration's handling of protesters. There were plenty of peaceful protesters marching in early and mid June. But these protests stopped being peaceful and stopped being about George Floyd a long time ago…  Nevertheless, the UN believes they have an opening to intervene in our country's affairs. The United Nations delivered a formal stand down order to the Trump administration this week, ordering the President to stop Federal officers from using non-lethal force against peaceful protesters in Portland.  This is how the UN uses the taxd ollars we send them… Against us!  Don't let the Democrats and GOP cowards get away with restoring the UN's funding! Please, send your instant FaxBlast to Congress before it's too late and force them to kill the funding increase and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act instead!  “Peaceful demonstrations that have been taking place in cities in the US, such as Portland, really must be able to continue without those participating in them… risking arbitrary arrest or detention, being subject to unnecessary, disproportionate or discriminatory use of force, or suffering other violations of their rights, proclaimed the UN Human Rights Office's spokesperson.  The UN delivered a formal stand down order to the Trump administration, warning that there would be consequences if Federal officers continued enforcing Federal law…  The City of Portland has also ordered the federal officers that Trump sent in to remove the protective fence that had been erected around the federal courthouse. They are trying to get a judge to block the officers from using any non-lethal weapons and they want to remove the fencing so that the mob can have unrestricted access to the building.  In case you haven't been paying attention, Porttland, Oregon has seen almost 60 straight days of unrest. The mainstream media calls them protests, but they are more aptly described as riots. For three weeks, these rioters have been trying to burn down the federal courthouse in their city.  Rioters broke the glass windows and tossed lit explosives into the building, in an attempt to burn it down. That is when President Trump and Attorney General Barr ordered federal officers in to protect the building and its workers.  For three weeks, there have been nightly standoffs between officers and rioters. Every night, the rioters try to kill the officers and burn down the courthouse. But come sunrise, the courthouse is still standing and more ANTIFA goons are behind bars facing federal charges.  The mainstream media doesn't report any of this. Instead, they are claiming that federal agents are kidnapping people. That's right, even though these people get charged and arraigned, the mainstream media is calling them kidnappings instead of arrests…  Did you know that the other night, the ANTIFA mob trapped federal officers inside the courthouse, barricaded the door, and then tried to burn the building down with them all inside? Did you know that dozens of officers have been injured after peaceful protesters lobbed explosives at them and shined lasers in their eyes potentially permanently blinding the officers? Did you know that every single rioter has been arrested has been charged with a crime, read their rights, brought before a judge, and arraigned?  The image above shows a federal officer, armed with only a paintball gun, being hit by an explosive fired at him by the rioters…  And yet, the UN calls this a violation of the rioters' human rights. Not only are they ordering Trump to end all law enforcement efforts in Portland, but they are threatening action and, yes, even an intervention if the President continues to allow officers to use tear gas against the mob.  This is what your taxes are paying for. Once you average out our annual donation to the UN, the average American taxpayer ends up sending approximately 50d ollars to the United Nations every single year. And this is what we have to show for it…  Don't let the Democrats and GOP cowards get away with restoring the UN's funding! Please, send your instant FaxBlast to Congress before it's too late and force them to kill the funding increase and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act instead!  Here is the good news: The UN has not received its funding yet. While House Democrats are hell-bent on increasing the United States' contribution to the United Nations by removing the cuts that Trump has made, their bill has not become law yet.  There is still time to stop it!  The UN literally has their employees on the ground working with the protesters trying to kill these officers and burn down the courthouse. The UN has already put out a release saying that they stand with Antifa they deleted the tweet after people started condemning them for it.  This is why the United Nations CANNOT receive even a cent of Federal funding!

55b36510,"The leftist Democrat Gov. of Oregon, Kate Brown, issued an astounding lie blaming Trump for the murder of a Trump supporter by an Antifa terrorist.  Brown issued her truth-free comment on Saturday, August 29, claiming that it is Trump who is responsible for the tens of thousands of Antifa and Black Lives terrorists burning and looting America’s cities and killing people from coast t coast.  Are liberal voter really so stupid as to believe this garbage?  For the last several years, and escalating in recent months, President Trump has encouraged division and stoked violence. It happened in Charlottesville. It happened in Kenosha. And now, unfortunately, it is happening in Portland, Oregon,” she exclaimed in her Saturday comment  “But despite the President’s jeers and tweets, this is a matter of life and death,” she added.  Yeah. Death dealt by Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists. Not a single person has died or even been injured by the federal operatives Trump has sent to various Democrat-controlled cities. On the other had, more than 30 people have died across the country at the hands of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and Democrat rioters and looters.  “Whether it’s his completely incompetent response to the pandemic, where nearly 200,000 have died, or his outright encouragement of violence in our streets: it should be clear to everyone by now that no one is truly safe with Donald Trump as President,” she said.  This is, of course, all a lie. Trump has never “outright encouraged violence in the streets.” Not only that, but 200,000 people have not died from COVID in the U.S.A. The official number is 183,000 but a large number of those are false reports based on assumptions, instead of facts.  The CDC recently sheepishly noted that only six percent of the deaths recorded as COVID were actually caused by COVID.  CDC: For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death. — Phil Kerpen @kerpen August 6, 2020  Next Brown tried to blame the riots on righties who oppose her draconian coronavirus lockdowns.  “Throughout this pandemic, whether it was demonstrations protesting my COVID-19 executive orders, or large crowds marching for the cause of Black Lives Matter to call for police reform, I have supported the rights of all Oregonians to peacefully protest,” she wrote.  Seriously? Does anyone believe that it is right-leaning COVID-scoffers are the reason Brown’s cities are burning?  Is ANYONE dumb enough to believe that?  Then she excused her leftist protesters and praised them as simply wonderful human beings.  “For months this summer, we have seen powerful images of Oregonians uniting for the cause of racial justice, calling for justice for Black men and women who have been killed by police violence. We remember them, we say their names. George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery. Philando Castile. Alton Sterling. And far too many other Black lives taken by racist violence.”  Moron, THESE are the people who are burning down your cities.  “For weeks, we have also seen small groups of demonstrators from all ends of the political spectrum who are intent on committing acts of vandalism and violence,” she conclued. “Tragically, yesterday a life was lost in downtown Portland. We do not yet know the full circumstances of this person’s death. Regardless, a life has been lost, and our hearts go out to this person’s family. We will find those who were responsible, and they will be held accountable.”  Are Democrat voters really stupid enough to believe these lies?

cda94a74,"Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Barak Hussein Obama, Joe Biden is preparing to cower to the Iranian Caliphate in the form of a $3 trillion apology for the Trump administration’s assassination of their top General, Qassem Soleimani.  While the assassination was celebrated by democracies worldwide, Democrats in the US accused Trump of showboating, resulting in raised tensions with the Muslim country.  The continuous funneling of cash from US taxpayers to Iran between the Obama, and now Biden administrations, is shameful. While our veterans lay homeless on our streets and our corporations are being threatened with higher taxes, Democrats have decided to fund a known enemy to the US.  This is the very definition of treason. Not even bleeding heart Jimmy Carter sank so low in his dealings with Iran.  The jet, handpicked by Biden’s Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is a Dassault Falcon 8X. While the Dassault made its name in the military and commercial aircraft space, the larger Falcon jets carved out a niche in the business space due to their impressive range 5,950 nautical miles, a digital flight control system, and an ability to customize the plane’s interiors into 30+ formats depending on usage priorities.  With the versatility to make both long-range and short-range trips courtesy of a tri-jet engine, the Falcon models offer speed, efficiency, and improved comfort. Sources tell us there will be a handwritten note from Biden on top of the cash that will simply say, “Enjoy the cash. Keep the Jet.”  Due to its payload, this flight will take on a particular significance in aeronautic history. It will be the most valuable payload ever transported by aircraft. To bear this grave responsibility, Bilken enlisted retired US Airways pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, famed pilot depicted by the legendary Tom Hanks in the 2016 blockbuster hit “Sully”.  Sullenberger insisted his longtime personal flight steward Andres Esquer be along for the all-important flight. Esquer famously served an entire Boeing 777 full of rowdy Oasis fans two cocktails each from one single liter of vodka on an international flight from Heathrow to JFK in 1998, a feat that is still mentioned during pillow talk amongst flight attendants and pilots to this day.  He is certified in CPR and BJJ. He is also an amateur pilot, more than capable of manhandling the aircraft should anything unfortunate befall Sully.  The offer of cash as an apology only serves to lessen our standing in the world. The only silver lining here is that it is being delivered by the best America has to offer.",Biden to Send $3 Trillion on Plane to Iran as Apology for Soleimani Assassination,FALSE

Ohio Department of Health ODH Interim Director Lance Himes issued a state-wide order on Aug. 31 enacting these camps to house people who “are unable to safely self-quarantine in their place of residence and to isolate those diagnosed with or showing symptoms of COVID-19.”  The Ohio camps will be used to house people who “test positive for COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization but need isolation including those exiting from hospitals; those who have been exposed to COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization; and asymptomatic high-risk individuals needing social distancing as a precautionary measure.”  Dan Tierney, who works as the press secretary to Ohio’s Republican Governor Mike DeWine, downplayed any worries about the FEMA camps being erected throughout the state.  “The order gives the state of Ohio the ability to draw down federal funding to reimburse the local EMA and health department when a non-congregate shelter is needed. These shelters are used when an individual is unable to safely quarantine or isolate in their home,” he said during a press conference.  “The nature of these shelters is no different than what the EMA and others stand-up during natural disasters. The intent of the order is to provide a safe and healthy space for the individual who needs to be quarantined or isolated as determined by local needs. This also helps protect family members from exposure. FEMA has FAQ’s and more information available,” Tierney continued.  “As determined by local needs’ remains ambiguous as an answer to the question of who decides whether a person’s residence is safe,” he added.  Big League Politics has reported on the previously unfathomable abuses that are being introduced to society due to COVID-19 mass hysteria:  A so-called medical expert, drunk off power due because of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, is now suggesting “morality pills” for the public to stop them from resisting their top-down mandates. Parker Crutchfield, who works as the Associate Professor of Medical Ethics, Humanities and Law at Western Michigan University, made the suggestion in an op/ed published in The Conversation. “When someone chooses not to follow public health guidelines around the coronavirus, they’re defecting from the public good,” Crutchfield writes. He is proposing a solution to drug society so that individuals will no longer have the freedom of choice and be at the mercy of the whims of whoever is in power. “Could a psychoactive pill be the solution to the pandemic? It’s a far-out proposal that’s bound to be controversial, but one I believe is worth at least considering, given the importance of social cooperation in the struggle to get COVID-19 under control,” Crutchfield writes. He uses “experimental economics” to justify his highly invasive solution that is something out of “Brave New World.” “Moral enhancement is the use of substances to make you more moral. The psychoactive substances act on your ability to reason about what the right thing to do is, or your ability to be empathetic or altruistic or cooperative,” Crutchfield writes. He brings up heinous abuses that the government has performed in the past to justify new abuses in the current age. “The scenario in which the government forces an immunity booster upon everyone is plausible. And the military has been forcing enhancements like vaccines or “uppers” upon soldiers for a long time,” Crutchfield writes.

After all, they are the greatest generation that built this country into the earthly paradise that it is today, with all the freedoms and benefits that every citizen now enjoys such as paid leave and healthcare.  The latest evidence of this comes from their proposal to “reform Social Security,” as they put it. However, simple reform is deceiving when describing what they propose to do. They don’t want to change the way we manage the funds or how they are delivered. Democrats just want to screw senior citizens and delay their retirement years and not just buy a couple of years either. No, the new policy is proposing to raise eligibility for Social Security by a decade, from the present 65 years old, to a whopping 75 years old.  Biden explained the proposal in an internal memo that has been leaked to us:  “Social Security is not sustainable. Either party will tell you this. Something radical has to be done, with the only other option being to just eliminate it. There’s absolutely no reason why the elderly cannot work a little longer. None. Look at me. I’m still working.

The study was conducted by none other than Dr. Joe Barron, Director of the Dunning-Kruger Institute.  Below is an excerpt of the results of the study:  “After an intense three month study, we have found conclusive evidence that people that wear masks have a lower IQ. This was clearly demonstrated in all of our studies. In the first of these studies, we took mask wearers and anti-maskers. The maskers scored much lower in the IQ test portion. This test measures their idiot quotient. The anti-maskers, on the other hand, scored much hire in this measure. In one of our other studies, we tested the basic science knowledge of maskers and anti-maskers. On average, anti-maskers believed that the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, and that 5G causes homosexuality. They also believed that masks could somehow block oxygen and trap CO2 inside of the mask, while simultaneously allowing a virus to permeate the mask. This is literally impossible as molecules of oxygen and CO2 are much smaller than viral droplets. Maksers seemed to grasp simple scientific principles. They also understood the simple facts about masks. They understood that oxygen and CO2 molecules are small enough to permeate through the mask while droplets containing the virus could not easily pass through the mask. Between these two studies and countless others we performed, we are confident in our conclusion that mask wearers have a lower IQ, or idiot quotient.”  This proves what us patriots already know.

a3ce9ec1,"Home » Africa, Breaking News, Crimes, Extinction » Tragedy in Nigeria as hundreds of Catholics found burnt alive by Muslims  This is a brutal example of how far the struggle between Muslims and Catholics in Nigeria has reached.  Muslims are determined to impose their ‘religion’ all over Africa as well as in other continents and countries of the world. Islam has but one goal: rule the world at any cost!  And where are the International Human Rights Organizations? Christians are burnt alive in Nigeria: a horrific Holocaust right in front of International indifference! As denounced by Father Juan Carlos Martos, on behalf of the Missionari Clarettiani, via del Sacro Cuore di Maria, Rome, Italy.  By publishing this graphic document on Facebook, I have intended to make the world aware of certain terrible events totally ignored or minimized by the mainstream media; an authentic genocide so cruel and inhuman only comparable with the most hateful and vile acts in the Nazi extermination camps.  To my great surprise, Facebook has criticized me for the publication of this graphic document as a proof of the Holocaust that Christians have been suffering in Nigeria in the last ten years. According to Facebook’s Security policy of the ‘social’ Network, this photo has been classified as ‘pornographic’, ‘violent’ or ‘inappropriate’ and hence I was disallowed to publish any picture for a week. And I was threatened drastic measures if I insist publishing any document that prove the terrible violations of Human Rights in Nigeria. This attitude by the Spanish Facebook Management is an attack to the freedom of expression as much as a shameful insult to the 500 victims only in this horrible episode slaughtered by Islamic terror only for being christian.  I thought that this social network, originated in the United States , would not bend its knees in front of terror.  Especially, when still healing their wounds suffered in the gruesome 9/11 attack, just as our own 3/11 at Madrid railway station, all innocent victims of the wild fury and insanity of Islamic terror.  This seems even more unacceptable in Spain, a Democratic state, where the rights of opinion, expression and religion are guaranteed by the Constitution Art. 16 and 20, if there is an attempt to limit such rights, let alone through threats and coercion thus weakening their freedom of expression by condemning as “inappropriate” a graphic document not a photomontage which reflects a brutal reality in all its crudeness.  Contrarily, the Administrators of Facebook Spain should welcome this public protest advocating that such a barbarian act will never be replicated and that its perpetrators will be brought to justice. This is a right and duty of every citizen: a service to society, ultimate goal, I feel, of any network that defines itself as ‘social’.  Regrettably, if the murders continue, this is greatly because truth is always hidden to the sovereign people, so that they may not be aware and ‘disdained’ by it: complicit silence by the mainstream media leads to the indifference of the international political community facing this unspeakable Holocaust! Let alone the cowardice already rooted in the western world facing the Islamic terror. A consequence of the stupid ” Alliance of civilizations”: another regrettable incident of our former Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero.  Can you imagine the reaction of the Islamic terrorist organization in the impossible case of a massacre of Muslims in a mosque, by the hands of christian terrorists? And how widely would our media cover and condemn the crime and the criminals??  Therefore, from this modest blog, I ask a favor from all people who are reading me: please distribute this photo and its comments using all the media you have.

fcf3c79b,"Mouthwash has the potential to protect against COVID-19 infection by killing the coronavirus before it can infect human cells, according to a new report.  Coronaviruses belong to the class of 'enveloped viruses', meaning they are covered by a fatty layer that is vulnerable to certain chemicals.  A team of international researchers say mouthwash could destroy the outermost layer or 'envelope' of the virus, preventing its replication in the mouth and throat.  The scientists say there is an urgent need to test the effectiveness of mouthwash in trials, although there is currently no clinical evidence that it would be successful.  The World Health Organisation has already said: 'There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.'  The study authors do not say that current commercially-available mouthwash prevents COVID-19, but that further research into mouthwash chemicals could be beneficial.  Readily available dental mouthwashes have the potential to destroy the lipid envelope of coronaviruses, combating virus replication in the mouth and throat  Writing in Function, the study authors, led by Cardiff University, say oral rinses are an ‘under-researched area of major clinical need’.  The team is backed by virologists, lipid specialists and healthcare experts from Cardiff University’s School of Medicine, along with the universities of Nottingham, Colorado, Ottawa, Barcelona and Cambridge’s Babraham Institute.  'Safe use of mouthwash – as in gargling – has so far not been considered by public health bodies in the UK,' said lead author Professor O’Donnell, co-director of Cardiff University’s Systems Immunity Research Institute.  'In test tube experiments and limited clinical studies, some mouthwashes contain enough of known virucidal ingredients to effectively target lipids in similar enveloped viruses.  'What we don’t know yet is whether existing mouthwashes are active against the lipid membrane of SARS-CoV-2.  'Our review of the literature suggests that research is needed as a matter of urgency to determine its potential for use against this new virus.'  'This is an under-researched area of major clinical need – and we hope that research projects will be quickly mobilised to further evaluate this.'  Coronavirus is a type of enveloped virus, meaning it has an outer lipid membrane that could be damaged by chemicals in mouthwash. Naked viruses lack the viral envelope  The ingredients of dental mouthwashes, including chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine, all have the potential to prevent infection and several ‘deserve clinical evaluation’, according to the researchers.  In particular, these chemicals disrupt the outer lipid membrane, known as the ‘viral envelope’ or ‘lipid envelope’ of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.  The lipid envelope helps several viruses, including coronaviruses, bind to human cells while avoiding the host immune system.  Specific spike proteins called ‘glycoproteins’ on the surface of the envelope identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's cell membrane, which allows infection.  Mouthwash chemicals could potentially modify the ability of the spike glycoproteins to interact with receptors on host cells.  The researchers said there had so far been 'no discussion' about the potential role of damaging the fatty membrane as a possible way to inactivate the virus.  The lipid envelope does not change when viruses mutate, meaning mouthwash could still work against any new coronavirus strains that emerge from this pandemic.  The WHO has previously debunked the suggestion that mouthwash can prevent infection by SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  'Some brands of mousthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth,' it said.  'However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection.'  WHO has emphatically debunked the theory that gargling mouthwash can prevent infection by the coronavirus  Research in this area appears to be largely unexplored – Listerine, one of the biggest mouthwash brands, says on its website that none of its products have been tested against any strains of coronavirus.  'Listerine mouthwash is not intended to be used, nor would it be beneficial as a hand sanitizer or surface disinfectant,' it says.  Common mouthwashes contain the same key ingredient as coronavirus-killing hand santiser – alcohol.  However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US's public health authority, recommends a hand sanitiser that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol for effective protection, and Listerine's products consist of only around 20 per cent alcohol.  The World Health Organisation WHO also stresses that drinking pure alcohol, along with methanol or bleach, is incredibly dangerous.  These substances do not prevent or cure COVID-19 and can lead to disability and death.  'Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces – however you should never drink them,' WHO says on its website.  'They will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs.'","Coronavirus: Mouthwash could prevent transmission, report says",FALSE

e14592c0,"The deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was shocking in its scale — but it wasn't a surprise that it was committed by a white male.  Statistics show that since 1982, the majority of mass shootings — 54 percent — were committed by white men, according to data from Mother Jones. Black people were the second largest perpetrators of mass shootings based on ethnic background, but only accounted for roughly 16 percent of the total incidents during the same time period.  The average age of the shooters was 35, however, making the perpetrator in Las Vegas, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, somewhat of an outlier. It is too early to say if mental illness played a role in Paddock's case, but it has in a number of mass shootings, though it is perhaps too frequently pointed to as the primary cause.  Other research suggests white men commit mass shootings out of a sense of entitlement. James Holmes, for example, had failed out of his PhD program when he opened fire in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. Dylann Roof was unemployed when he gunned down nine people at the end of a prayer service in a Charteston, South Carolina church.  There's a feeling of entitlement that white men have that black men don't, criminologist James Alan Fox told The Washington Post in 2012. They often complain that their job was taken by blacks or Mexicans or Jews. They feel that a well-paid job is their birthright. It's a blow to their psyche when they lose that. .?.?. If you're a member of a group that hasn't historically experienced unemployment, there's a far greater stigma to [losing a job] than those who have.  But others say it's hard to point to any single factor in terms of why white men have comitted most mass shootings.  There are pieces of the puzzle, and you put them all on the jigsaw board, and you're still going to have a big hole there. What I do know is that violent behavior — whether it's serious violence or minor violence in populations — is never just one thing. It's not a one thing problem.

We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.

7eea4e9f,"Donald Trump blames 'anti-American riots' for unrest in Kenosha, doesn't focus on Blake or Rittenhouse shootings  KENOSHA - President Donald Trump on Tuesday rolled into this city shaken by shootings, death and unrest, hailing law enforcement for quelling disturbances but offering little to those seeking justice for Jacob Blake.  During a tour of the city and a roundtable discussion at Bradford High School, Trump declared victory in Wisconsin and said that the federal government can help other communities that face strife, including Portland, Oregon.  Kenosha has been ravaged by anti-police and anti-American riots,” the president said as photos of the destruction in the city were displayed behind the group.  But he did not want to address what sparked protests that gave way to the destruction, refusing to answer whether he believed systemic racism was a problem in the United States. Instead, he suggested some police forces are being unfairly criticized for simply choking.  When you see they have made allegations they must be fully and fairly investigated ... but you can do an incredible job for years and then you have one bad apple or something bad that happens that's bad and that's the nightly news for three weeks, Trump said.  When that happens, “they’re either dead or they’re in big trouble. People have to understand that. They choke sometimes, Trump said at a table with the Kenosha police chief and Kenosha County sheriff just days after a white city police officer shot Blake, a Black man, in the back seven times.  Asked about what he would say to Blake, Trump said: I feel terribly for anybody who goes through that. As you know it's under investigation. It's a big thing happening right now ... I hope they come up with the right answer. It's a complicated answer.  During remarks, Trump said, I really came today to thank law enforcement. Really, what you have done has been incredible, it has been really inspiring.  Trump brought with him to Kenosha U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and Homeland Security director Chad Wolf to announce efforts to respond to the unrest.  Trump said he will send $42 million to Wisconsin to rebuild from the unrest, including $4 million for Kenosha businesses that experienced damage and more money to prosecute crimes.  Just ahead of Trump's visit, Gov. Tony Evers announced he and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. would make available up to $1 million worth of interest-free loans for damaged businesses in Kenosha.  Trump visits torched businesses  Trump's first stop in Kenosha was to B&L Office Furniture, which was torched by violent protesters after Blake was shot.  We're going to work with you, Trump told John Rode, who owns the Rode's Camera Shop building a few streets over, also destroyed last week.  We're going to help you rebuild. It's a great area, it's a great state. A thing like this should never happen. They have to call early, Trump said.  Rode, who sold his family's camera shop to new owners in 2008, joined the president after the current owners of the business itself declined to appear with the president on his tour Tuesday.  I said no, thank you — I didn't want anything to do with President Trump, co-owner Paul Willette told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. If it were any other president I would, but not this one. I can't begin to describe my frustration with him. I politely declined coming down there. I didn't want to be part of that fiasco.  Rode credited Trump for bringing federal troops to Kenosha to calm the area, though the soldiers in Kenosha are National Guard members under the direction of state officials.  I just appreciate President Trump coming today; everybody here does, Rode told reporters after meeting with Trump in the rubble of the furniture business.  Kenosha erupted last week with rage on Aug. 23 after Blake's shooting.  During the third night of protests and violence, a 17-year-old, Kyle Rittenhouse from Antioch, Illinois, brought an assault-style rifle to Kenosha's downtown and allegedly shot three people and killed two of them. He is charged with six crimes as a result of the incident, including first-degree intentional homicide.  During the president's tour of the city, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis said what transpired here was an attack on America, but it's unclear whether he included the deadly shooting in that assessment.  By coming to Kenosha, the president entered a potentially fraught situation. Evers and other top Democrats asked him to put off the trip to allow the city to heal.  But the president pressed ahead, landing in Waukegan, Illinois, and arriving by motorcade in Kenosha.  Thousands of people lined the streets on his route, many expressing their support for the president by waving American flags and Trump campaign signs. Others waved their middle finger and held signs of opposition. One sign read you're not helping.  He surveyed some damage in Kenosha before going to Bradford High School, where a makeshift command post has been established.  The high school cafeteria was full of law enforcement and National Guard members. The group had collected items from protesters and placed them in the middle of the room as a display.  There are still more than 1,500 National Guard personnel in the city, and a curfew is in place.  U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson told Trump that his response calling Evers to facilitate more National Guard troops ought to be a model for calming riots elsewhere in the country.  All you have to do is ask and we’ll be there literally within minutes, Trump responded.  But throughout the visit, Trump and Wisconsin Republicans accompanying him made statements that would mislead the public into believing it was Trump that authorized the National Guard forces.  Such a mobilization is under Gov. Tony Evers' and other governors' authority.  Blake's family held their own event nearby and said Trump emboldened police to take aggressive and sometimes deadly action against Black Americans by defending Rittenhouse.  RELATED: Witnesses describe the night Kyle Rittenhouse opened fire during protests after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha  That’s the language that got us here, Justin Blake, Jacob Blake's uncle, said of Trump's comments. That’s the language that fed police officers all around this country the belief that they could attack young, unarmed Black men and shoot them in the back seven times. And that’s why I’m not directing anything toward that gentleman today, and I use that term loosely.  U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan criticized Trump for failing to condemn the actions of Rittenhouse, the Illinois teen.  What we need right now are messages of healing, of uniting people, of bringing people together. I hope that the president finds that capability today. But his rhetoric up to this point has not been about healing, Pocan said ahead of Trump's visit.  Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement, Trump failed once again to meet the moment, refusing to utter the words that Wisconsinites and Americans across the country needed to hear today from the president: a condemnation of violence of all kinds, no matter who commits it.  Outside Bradford High School, hundreds of Trump supporters and opponents intermingled on sidewalks and parking lots. Don’t arrest us, arrest the police, one group chanted as others waved Trump flags.  The president refused to answer whether he thought systemic racism was a problem in the country, saying reporters should instead focus on the destruction people angry about it have committed.  I think peaceful protesting is fantastic, it's great, Trump said. But by and large this is not peaceful protesting. When you walk into an area, you see buildings that have been burned down. Fortunately, here we stopped it earlier.  Later, he said there are people who want change, including those who want to see law and order.  You don't see them marching, you don't see them on the streets, but what they want is a great police force, people that are going to keep them safe where their houses aren't broken into, where they're not raped and murdered, he said.  Barr on Tuesday claimed federal law enforcement dispatched to Chicago picked up information that these violent instigators were coming to Kenosha. They were coming from California, Washington state, a lot from Chicago.  He said law enforcement expected matters to get worse, and added the looting and the arson were unacceptable.  Trump emphasized the use of the National Guard to stop the disturbances in Kenosha and he kept up criticism against Evers, who he said rejected an offer of federal help, only to turn around a day later and accept the offer.  But he also said Evers was better than most Democratic leaders by working with Trump after the deadly shooting on Tuesday.  Blake was shot when officers responded to a police call alleging Blake was not supposed to be at a residence in the area. Blake was shot trying to get into a vehicle outside the residence.  Police found a knife on the floorboard of the vehicle, but it's unknown whether officers knew Blake had the knife before one shot him.  According to an update released Tuesday by the Department of Justice, the DOJ's Department of Criminal Investigation, along with the FBI, have so far conducted 88 interviews, collected 102 evidence items, downloaded 28 videos and issued four search warrants.  Patrick Marley and Mary Spicuzza of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.  Editor's note, Sept. 1, 10:30 p.m.: This story has been updated.

Sessions was in Milwaukee for the announcement  Bringing his law and order message to Milwaukee, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Monday he's assigning two more prosecutors to the U.S. attorney's office here to focus on violent crime.  Sessions spoke to federal and local law enforcement members at the federal courthouse, where earlier this month a federal-local task force announced charges in a major drug bust linked to dozens of overdose deaths in southeast Wisconsin. He did not take questions.  Sessions cited statistics pointing to an uptick in violent crime in the U.S. in recent years and highlighted prominent local homicide cases, including the murder of a pizza delivery driver and the fatal shooting of a pregnant woman.  Sadly, this beautiful city has not been immune to these problems, Sessions said.  For the past two years, Milwaukee has struggled with high rates of homicide — a similar spike was seen in Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis — though the number of killings is trending down this year.  Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said the department will record decreases this year in virtually every single crime category compared with last year, but crime is still too high.  He called Sessions' announcement significant.  We recognize we generate far more arrests than can be handled by the courts as it is, but obviously having the federal venue for our more serious offenders, particularly gun offenders, is very promising, Flynn said.  Outside the courthouse, demonstrators protested Sessions and criticized changes he made to police reform programs, including the collaborative reform process that was underway in Milwaukee under the previous presidential administration.  It's a farce to say he cares about preventing violence, said State Rep. David Bowen D-Milwaukee.  If he was truly committed, he would start with making sure we have a Police Department that had great community relations with the people they serve, treating people with dignity and respect, he said.  Sessions has changed the reform program to focus on sharing crime prevention tips. No final report on the Milwaukee Police Department has been released, but a draft has been used as a starting point for residents, city officials and police leaders for reform efforts.  RELATED: How residents would reform the Milwaukee Police Department  RELATED: City officials, including Chief Edward Flynn, pledge to move forward on draft DOJ reforms  RELATED: DOJ draft report: Trust damaged between Milwaukee police, community  Sessions has been traveling to different cities to discuss violent crime and is scheduled to appear in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday.  Last week, he held a news conference in Baltimore focused on illegal immigration and international gangs. Days later, he assigned three additional federal prosecutors to that region, the Baltimore Sun reported.  Sessions' visit to Milwaukee comes weeks after the city's Police Department hosted other U.S. Department of Justice officials and New Orleans police for training about how Milwaukee police used a federal program to cut crime.  RELATED: Milwaukee police did something different to tackle crime in the city — they focused on just 2.3 square miles of it  Beginning in March 2016, the Milwaukee Police Department, the FBI and other federal partners focused on 2.3 square miles on the north side known as the Center Street Corridor. Police statistics had shown 10% of all violent crime in the city occurred in that area.  The program, known as the Public Safety Partnership, brought a local law enforcement priority to the forefront of the federal agencies and resulted in a dramatic drop in nonfatal shootings in that area in 2016, officials said.  Authorities said after the initial success in 2016, the department backed off too soon and crime began to re-emerge in the targeted area.  Sessions also came to Wisconsin this summer to address the opioid crisis. The attorney general said drugs are destroying and bankrupting families nationwide during a speech at the annual conference of the National Alliance for Drug Endangered Children.",AG Jeff Sessions adding 2 more federal prosecutors in Milwaukee to combat violent crime,partially false

6bd820f6,"We knew that Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick wasn’t going to be an NRA member or a Second Amendment supporter, but that doesn’t mean he had to pick someone who actually argued in 2008 that Washington, D.C.’s ban on handguns didn’t violate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala Harris signed on to an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court in the Heller case, arguing that “for nearly 70 years courts have consistently sustained criminal firearms laws against Second Amendment challenges by holding that, inter alia, i the Second Amendment provides only a militia-related right to bear arms, ii the Second Amendment does not apply to legislation passed by state or local governments, and iii the restrictions bear a reasonable relationship to protecting public safety and thus do not violate a personal constitutional right.” The brief, written by Adrian Fenty at the time the Attorney General for Washington, D.C. urged the Supreme Court to uphold the District’s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a firearms storage law requiring guns to be kept locked up or disassembled with ammunition stored separately. To do otherwise, claimed Fenty, Harris, and several other prosecutors, would create “a broad private right to possess any firearm that is a ‘lineal descendant’ of a founding era weapon and that is in ‘common use’ with a ‘military application’ today.” Create a right. In other words, Kamala Harris told the Supreme Court that Americans didn’t have an individual right to possess a firearm that is in common use, turning a right of the people into a privilege to be exercised by a chosen few. Harris lost the argument in 2008, but she’s been opposing the right to keep and bear arms ever since. As District Attorney, Harris demanded an end to gun shows at the Cow Palace convention center just outside of the San Francisco city limits, and as California’s Attorney General she not only defended the state’s gun control laws in court, but according to California Rifle & Pistol Association president Chuck Michel, she failed to properly oversee several databases that the state uses to determine whether or not someone is eligible to own a firearm. .. not one but two separate Reports from the California State Auditor have found serious problems with the way the DOJ processes mental health records to determine a person’s firearm eligibility. Despite these multiple admonitions, Harris has failed to fix the problems. A 2013 Report from the California State Auditor found that under Harris, the DOJ “had not sufficiently reached out to the courts or mental health facilities to remind them to promptly report required information,” which if done would have allowed the DOJ to determine when dangerously mentally ill persons were in possession of firearms or attempting to purchase them. Additionally, this report found that: [K]ey decisions, such as whether a person is prohibited, are left to staff whose work does not receive a supervisory review. Because of these issues, Justice cannot identify all armed prohibited persons in California as effectively as it should, and the information it uses to ensure public safety by confiscating firearms is incomplete. As U.S. Senator, Kamala Harris has backed bans on so-called assault weapons, universal background check mandates, and more, but it was her short-lived presidential campaign that really allowed her to once again tout her anti-gun agenda. Harris proclaimed that if she was elected president, she would enact gun control with or without the support of Congress. “Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. We need action, and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I’m elected, I’ll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don’t, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country, because it is time to act.” Expect the media to highlight the fact that Harris says she owns a gun, in order to portray her as some sort of “moderate” on the issue of the right to keep and bear arms. She’s not a moderate. She’s a hypocrite. Here’s what she told a CNN townhall audience last April. “I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do — for personal safety,” the California Democrat said Thursday. “I was a career prosecutor.” Remember, as a career prosecutor Harris argued that you and I don’t have a right to own a handgun for personal safety, and that local governments should be able to ban you and I from legally possessing one. As a member of law enforcement, of course Harris would have been exempt from the very gun bans she wanted to keep in place in Washington, D.C., but she wanted local governments to be able to strip you of your ability to legally own a firearm for self-defense. Harris may own a gun, but that doesn’t mean she believes that you have a right to own one too.",Kamala Harris Says She Supports Your Second Amendment Rights. Her Record Proves Otherwise,FALSE
ad0f9105,"As Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron held a press conference to explain why Breonna Taylor’s killers were not indicted in her death, activists prepared themselves for ongoing protests. A witness observed a U-Haul truck loaded with protective gear unloading the supplies to prepare the protestors for police backlash come nightfall.  The U-Haul truck was spotted on Wednesday at 2 pm. This happened after the grand jury did not charge the police officers in the death of the young female first responder. Cops had botched a raid on her apartment and shot her while she was sleeping in bed.  Taylor was killed on March 13, two months before George Floyd died on May 25. Police battered down her apartment door in the middle of the night without knocking. While they did have a search warrant, the police shocked sleeping Taylor and her boyfriend.  The so-called “riot gear” that the protestors removed from the U-Haul truck included “shields” that were made of canvas and other materials to enable them to stand together and raise awareness around police brutality.  The group of Black Lives Matter activists pulled hand-painted signs and banners from the moving truck, which included slogans like “Abolish the Police” and “Abolition Now!”  One woman was caught on camera shouting, “Shields, we got shields!”  Another woman, who appeared to be helping organize the supply drop-off, distributed masks for protestors to remain safe during the pandemic. They also handed out free goggles and water bottles to the people who have hit the streets for months to protest the way Taylor was killed in her bed.  The supplies that were distributed were designed for use in the peaceful protests that happened in the wake of the grand jury decision not to charge the police officers with Taylor’s death. While protests were peaceful throughout the day, violence occurred at night.  “They’re organized, and there’s funding behind this as well. We know that there was that one U-Haul, I wonder if there were others out there as well,” remarked Fox News contributor Deneen Borelli on-air.  Some people accused Trump and Republicans of empowering the protestors just so they could get beaten by police later.  “Does anyone else think that the Trump campaign or Republicans could be behind this U-Haul van handing out shields and ‘abolish the police’ signs in Louisville?” one person said, floating the conspiracy theory on Twitter. “It would just be so easy for Trump and the GOP to sell their stupid narrative, wouldn’t it?”  Although media organizations contacted U-Haul for comment, a spokesperson was not able to provide one or share the rental history of that particular vehicle with the public.  While the protests were peaceful all day, at nightfall, things changed. A group of heavily-armed police officers – resembling an army preparing for war – closed in on a group of protestors and fired shots. The police were trying to disperse the crowd before the 9 pm curfew went into effect.  Rounds were fired after police bombarded the peaceful protesters with “flash-bang” rounds and chemical bombs.

8cead4c2,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE. CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson. READ THE LANDMARK RESEARCH HERE The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine. “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study. “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens. “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens. “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists CSTE, a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5, new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license section VII.A3 – page 5, and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case section VII.B – page 7,” stated All Concerned Citizens. “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME, to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.

6ac3e6b6,"The rapid and uncontrolled population growth of feral swine in Texas and other affected states has been a severe problem for at least the last decade, damages caused by the wild animals reaching into the millions just in Texas.  Nationally, feral swine cause major damage to property, agriculture crops and livestock, native species and ecosystems, and cultural and historic resources. This invasive species costs the United States an estimated $1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs.  Related: No end in sight for Texas' war against feral swine  In addition to these concerns, because of their very nature, feral swine, which wallow along river banks, lakes and ponds, are known to spread diseases to other types of wildlife, and domestic animals. Feral pigs are also becoming a problem in some suburban areas as they root up turf at homes, parks and golf courses. They also turn over and root through trash cans in suburban areas and pose a driving hazard when moving in large numbers near roadways and highways.  In recent years a major effort to control population numbers has helped, but wildlife and public health officials say more needs to be done. But with an estimated five million feral swine running free in the United States, controlling the problem appears to be greater than current efforts to manage their numbers.  Limited Control Options  Existing control methods include hunting and trapping the animals, but in spite of eliminating a considerable number of the animals, feral swine continue to spread into other states not previously known to be feeding or breeding grounds. Overall, 39 states have reported some level of problem with wild pigs.  Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA. More effort to reduce their numbers has occurred in Texas than anywhere else, representing more traps, more hunts, and more research. Yet their numbers are growing, and so is the amount of damage they cause each year.  In 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveiled a wide-reaching plan to deal with the feral hog problem, calling for what he termed a hog-apocalypse involving the distribution of a deadly poison bait. Miller initially approved the legal use of a commercial poison that contained warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. Once feral swine ingest the poison, they begin to bleed internally. But hunters and conservationists expressed concern, fearing other animals may be exposed to the toxin, possibly affecting any animal or human predator feeding on the meat of a poisoned pig.  Shortly after announcing its use, the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily removed the product from the market out of fear of lawsuits and other possible retribution.  Toxic Bait Evaluation  Now, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS is evaluating another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine. APHIS received an Experimental Use Permit EUP from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trials on free-roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November, and signed a final environmental assessment and issued a Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact FONSI associated with conducting field trials using the poison.  Wildlife Services takes the selection and use of toxic baits for use in wildlife damage management very seriously. The final environmental assessments, FONSI and EUP, are the result of years of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private, state, federal and international partners, reports APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay. With these in place, we can now begin field trials to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for removing feral swine sounders in natural settings, as well as any potential impacts to non-target wildlife.  Safeguards  Clay says the EUP allows researchers to partner with landowners to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounders herds each in Texas and Alabama. He said bait delivery systems designed to prevent access by non-target wildlife will be filled with placebo bait, placed in the sounders’ territories and monitored with motion-activated cameras.  Following a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting areas, the placebo bait will be replaced with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two nights. As a research method, at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoons in each state’s study area are to be captured live and radio-collared prior to baiting in order to monitor their movements and exposure to the bait. Landowners within 300 meters of bait stations will be notified, and signs will be placed on bait stations and along roads leading into the study areas.  Sodium nitrite NaNO2 is a meat preservative commonly used to cure meats such as sausage and bacon. When eaten in high doses over a short period of time, it is toxic to feral swine. The mode of death is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. Once enough sodium nitrite bait is eaten, the feral swine gets faint, is rendered unconscious, and quickly dies. In most cases, feral swine die within two and-a-half to three hours after eating a lethal dose, Clay said.  Researchers say many factors are considered when developing a toxic bait for feral swine. Not only must it be effective and humane in eliminating feral swine, but also must be low risk for those handling it, the environment, and wildlife. Other wildlife, such as raccoons, bears and deer, may be attracted to the sodium nitrite toxic bait, but to prevent non-target species from accessing it, researchers will use delivery systems and baiting strategies designed to target feral swine. Trials will not be conducted in areas with known black bear populations.  The trials are scheduled to begin in both Alabama and Texas as early as February.  Although trapping, aerial operations, and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduced damage in some areas, studies show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be removed each year in order to prevent population growth, Clay said. Should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine, it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrated feral swine damage management.  Skeptics  While farmers welcome technology that helps to control the damaging swine in their fields, there are skeptics.  Roland Ortiz, a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area, says wild hogs are very intelligent creatures, and they are prolific breeders. Ortiz stays busy hunting and trapping hogs on farms, ranches and lately in subdivisions that contract his services.  We are slowly pushing back into more sparsely populated areas, but they keep coming back. Managing them is a full time job, Ortiz said.  While he agrees a toxic bait would help to control wild swine populations, he doubts anything will ever solve the problem.  We have rat poison, but there's still lots of rats, Ortiz notes.",New research of toxic bait might provide control of wild hog problem in Texas and other states,partially false
1d925d14,"Jeremy Corbyn used his second keynote speech as Labour leader to launch an excoriating attack on wealthy individuals and corporations that avoid UK taxes – and pledged that a Labour government led by him would end the practice forever.  There is nothing more unpatriotic than not paying your taxes, he told delegates in the packed-out conference hall in Liverpool, to loud applause.  It is an act of vandalism, damaging our NHS, damaging older people’s social care, damaging younger people’s education. So a Labour government will make shabby tax avoidance a thing of the past.  HMRC estimates that illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance together cost the government about £34 billion a year, though in practice most experts agree much less than this could ever actually be collected. Successive Labour and Conservative governments have pledged to crack down on tax avoidance.  Corbyn also singled out former BHS owner Sir Philip Green for criticism over his tax affairs in a section of the speech attacking the Conservative government.  They’ve cut taxes for the privileged few, sold off our national assets to them, always on the cheap, and turned a blind eye to their chronic tax avoidance, he said of the Conservatives.  They’re so committed to the interests of the very richest they recruited Sir Philip Green into government as something called an efficiency tsar. Well, government might be a bit more efficient if the super rich like Sir Philip actually paid their taxes.  Green, who owns Topshop, was knighted by the last Labour government but was appointed as efficiency tsar by David Cameron in 2010. Green's companies are owned through his wife, who is based in Monaco, which means his family's tax liabilities are legally – but substantially – reduced versus what he would pay if he and his wife were UK-resident.","Labour Will End Unpatriotic Tax-Dodging, Jeremy Corbyn Vows",FALSE

9dd3f5d4,"Get ready for another big rise in train fares. This Wednesday we’ll see the publication of the latest retail prices index RPI. The Office for National Statistics thinks it is such a poor indicator of prices that it now designates it as “Not a National Statistic.” Yet this non-statistic, which is nearly always significantly higher than the CPI consumer prices index is nonetheless used as the official basis for raising train fares. And all the signs are that the squeeze on commuters is only going to get worse.  The cost of season tickets for commuters goes up in January, but the rise is dictated by the level of RPI the previous July, a figure usually published in mid-August. When the July figure for RPI is released this Wednesday, it will be at least 3.4% its current level but more likely 3.5% or even 3.6%, as petrol prices and home energy bill increases feed into the index. So with grim inevitability train fares will, yet again, rise faster than wages.  If rail fares were to go up in line with CPI, we could expect a rise of 2.4% next January. If they went up in line with wages, we’d expect a 2.5% increase. But the RPI formula means they regularly go up faster than wages. This time last year the RPI was 3.6%, enabling the rail companies to shove through big price increases on commuter routes at a time when wage growth was stalling.  What does a 3.5% rise mean in practice? For commuters from Cambridge into London terminals’ such as King’s Cross, the annual season ticket at the beginning of 2019 will smash through the £5,000 level, jumping from £4,952 to £5,125.  It’s worth noting that in Germany, Deutsche Bahn offers the BahnCard 100 that lets you board any train anywhere in the country for a year for €4,270 £3,840. In Britain we expect commuters to pay £1,263 more than that just for a 48-mile commuter journey from Cambridgeshire into the capital.  Meanwhile, a 3.5% rise will see the annual season ticket from Tunbridge Wells into London terminals jump from £4,644 to £4,806, while Reading to London will go from £4,464 to £4,620. Rochdale to Manchester will cost £1,196 instead of £1,156. And spare a thought for the miserable passengers on Britain’s officially most overcrowded route, the early morning train from Uckfield in Sussex to London Bridge, which on average is 250% full. They can expect to fork out another £105 on top of the £3,000 they are currently paying for an annual season ticket.  As the chancellor, Philip Hammond, prepares his autumn budget, he might want to listen to the Campaign for Better Transport: “We want the government to commit to a fares freeze and hold regulated rail fares at their current level. The government has frozen fuel duty for the last seven years and we think rail passengers should be given the same treatment. Given the mess surrounding the new timetable, the lack of improvements and the failure to deliver compensation, the government cannot go on telling passengers that fare increases are justified.”  Our train companies this week said they are trying to clean up ticketing. The Rail Delivery Group is getting rid of language such as “route direct”, “any permitted” and “London terminals” to simplify the system. It even proclaims there has already been an 11% improvement in the number of people buying the wrong ticket at a vending machine. But it remains absolutely astonishing that one in 10 ticket buyers still purchase the wrong ticket – usually leaving the traveller out of pocket, not the rail company – because we have such an absurdly complicated fares structure.

9401748d,"This is one in a series of articles taken from eyewitness testimony before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.  Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. The woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.  “In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16, hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”  Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.  Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis claimed that as a four year-old she was forced to witness murders of children that involved former Pope Ratzinger, a Dutch Catholic Cardinal, plus the father of Netherlands Belgium Queen Beatrix and Bilderberger Founder, Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard. “I saw the former Pope Joseph Ratzinger murder a little girl? another witness confirmed. “It was at a French chateau in the fall of 1987. It was ugly, horrible and didn’t happen just once. Ratzinger and Bernhard were some of the more prominent men who took part.”  In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.  Alleged to be present during the human hunting parties were the late Prince Johan Friso and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit, former ministers, the top man of the Dutch army, the under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, the Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix and other global business and political leaders including some from the US. “Surely the present King Willem Alexander and King Filip and their wives know about this abuse and murder of children” said one eyewitness.”They do nothing about it and likely are the ones to stop investigations and prosecutions.”  In January 2014 the brother of the king of Holland Prince Johan Friso passed away in a coma after these three Dutch-language websites shown here reached the internet. The websites revealed that Friso was at the human hunting and killing parties.”The story came on the internet after years of trying to move the policy and justice department in the Netherlands to act against the criminals,” an eyewitness said. “Nobody did anything to stop these criminals, probably because Queen Beatrix and King Albert likely interfered with the investigations.”  Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.  Human hunting parties were said to take place on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace in the Netherlands. Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased Prince Alfrink Bernhard, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.  The ICLCJ Court received a collection of Jesuit archival records about a child sacrificial cult known as the Knights of Darkness. In 1933 the Knights were established by the Catholic Jesuits and Nazi Waffen S.S. Division. The records showed Ratzinger was identified as a member of the Knights while working as an S.S. Chaplain’s assistant at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. The records also stated that Ratzinger participated in child sacrificial rites using kidnapped children from the camps or political prisoners.  Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. In this video her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.  Last week an Irish police investigator reported to the ICLCJ Court that the close to 800 babies buried in a Catholic Nun’s septic tank were dismembered, decapitated and in bits and pieces – signs that they could have been murdered in Satanic child sacrifice rites. In the last two months the ICLCJ Court has heard these heart-wrenching testimonies about the rape, torture and murder of children as recently as 2010 by Catholic leaders, European royal family members and other global elites. Murder sites of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were said to be in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals including the Vatican and on private estates, military establishments and groves in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, France, England and the US.  The ICLCJ Court has been overwhelmed with newly discovered evidence and a number of new witnesses coming forward to testify about Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult activities. They have uncovered Ninth Circle Satanic Cult member possible involvement in international child sacrifice, kidnapping, exploitation and drug rings. The five international judges and 27 jury members were expected to remain in session for at least a year due to the complexity of the cases.  Amnesty has been offered to citizens or employees of the Vatican, Crown of England, churches or governments willing to give sworn testimony or evidence that leads to the prosecution of these global elites suspected of committing crimes. Rewards up to 10,000 euros or around 13,660 dollars was available through the ICLCJ court.

7842996d,"Despite the backing of Mayor Lee Leffingwell and many of the city’s power brokers, Austin’s $1 billion transportation bond proposal, Proposition 1, went down to defeat Tuesday night. Opponents say it was the wrong plan in the wrong place, but those pushing for the mass transit system say it might have been Austin’s last chance at rail for a decade or more.  It was a crushing defeat for Austin’s only proposition on the ballot, which was voted down by about a 14 percent margin.  Citizens Against Rail Taxes founder Jim Skaggs told the Austin Monitor that he was elated.  “I think it’s a win, win, win. It’s a win for the taxpayers, it’s a win for transportation, and it’s a win for a system of transparency,” said Skaggs. “This entire plan was put together without any transparency, and what we need is a total mobility plan which is shared by the community and that is the only way to address the problems we have.”  He continued: “This rail was a huge cost for all taxpayers, the biggest taxpayer increase in history, on a community already burdened by the fastest growing tax increases of any major city in the nation … It was a huge portion of our funds for a minuscule portion of our needs. More than anything else, this thing proves that we need cost effective solutions for mobility, and those cost effective solutions have to address mobility for everybody, not for a minuscule few paid for and subsidized by all the rest.”  Let’s Go Austin campaign manager Lynda Rife was not elated.  “We’re disappointed. We worked really hard. We thought we had a good balance of roads and rail on the ballot. We thought we picked a route that would bring in the federal dollars, but the voters said, ‘No’,” said Rife.  Skaggs and Rife also had different hopes for the future, though both hoped to see Austin’s traffic problems addressed.  Skaggs said he’d like to see other, more transparent, transportation options considered by city planners in the future.  “I’d like to see two things,” said Skaggs “One, recognize that 99 percent of every trip is made on the roadways, be it private or public transit or shared or emergency or school or government vehicles, it’s on roads. And we need to fix our road system to accommodate that transportation. Second, we need to upgrade our transit system to support those people who need transit in their daily lives and have no alternative. And we need to stop trying to get people out of their cars to ride trains and other transit modes which are not viable for the 99.5 percent of the travelers.”  When asked whether she had plans for the future, Rife said, “110 people will move here tomorrow, and the next day and the next day. I’m hoping that someone is thinking about some kind of solutions.”  Rife hoped that transportation issues can be fixed, saying, “I think it’s choking our city, it’s a nightmare, and I’m worried about Austin. I’m hoping that the people who said that this wasn’t the right plan find a plan that they can support and we can all support.”  The pitch for an urban rail line was hotly debated on a number of fronts. Pro-rail supporters pointed to congestion and economic viability as reasons to support the line. They further argued that the passage of $600 million in city bond funds would leverage a matching $600 million from the federal government for the project. And they noted that a $400 million promise — seen in some quarters as a blatant pitch for support from the road warrior faction of the mobility infrastructure debate — attached to the rail bonds would ensure that necessary road work wouldn’t be left behind.  To make their case, supporters formed a political action committee, Let’s Go Austin, to fund outreach. As of that organization’s eight-day-out report, it had spent roughly $700,000. The money funded television ads, direct mail efforts and more.  Opponents of the project argued from two main camps: One, that the route and data behind the route selection were flawed, and another that fought the idea based on the prospective 6 cent per $100 of assessed property valuation tax increase.  Route opponents, loosely clumped as the Our Rail initiative, argued that the selected route — one that would extend from Highland Mall south through the University of Texas campus and downtown, across Lady Bird Lake and then east out East Riverside Drive — was not the right choice. They argued for a track that would instead run along the Lamar-Guadelupe corridor.  Meanwhile, advocates with the group AURA pushed hard against data delivered by city consultants as the project evaluation proceedings continued. Both Our Rail and AURA remained extremely vocal about their various stances via social media and at city meetings called to discuss the project.  Citizens Against Rail Taxes, or CART, followed more traditional lines in arguing that the route would be too expensive for taxpayers and relatively ineffective.  Three groups spent money arguing against the rail bond: As of the eight-day-out reports, CART had raised more than $114,000 and spent nearly $272,000. DeRail Austin raised $12,000 for that period and had spent $53,034. Our Rail spent $4,806.  This year’s result is the third time since 2000 that Austin Council members have gone to the polls for a vote on a rail project. The 2000 vote — on a fairly comprehensive rail system — came up just short. Then, in 2004, voters approved funds to construct the Capital MetroRail Red Line.

Update:  Snopes and a variety of other fact checkers attacked the claims made in this article. It is important to note, despite labelling the claim as false, none of the fact-checking websites actually disproved the claim that Putin’s daughter died after her second dose of Sputnik V.  It is important to note Putin’s Daughter has not made a public appearance since the claim was made. Further evidence is needed to completely debunk the original claim. Once she is seen in public, and the video can be independently verified, it can be said the original claim was inaccurate.  Until then, this file has been updated to “conflicting”.  Original Article:  Vladimir Putin’s daughter suffered unexpected side effects to the experimental Russian COVID vaccine, and has passed away in Moscow. The Kremlin has yet to make a statement on her death. A source within Russia’s inner circle stated that Putin’s daughter – Katerina Tikhonova – suffered a rise in temperature shortly after her second injection, and then suffered a seizure. Doctors were not able to reverse the side-effects of the vaccine, and she was pronounced dead late yesterday evening.  The Russian vaccine is named Sputnik V, after the first artificial satellite, launched into space by the Russians in 1957. It is also noteworthy that Sputnik is the name of Russia’s International News Station, which has been accused of being a propaganda wing of the Kremlin.  Russian vaccine 'Sputnik V' may be a new Chernobyl. — El Come Callao' @panzenu August 15, 2020  Prior to Katerina’s death, Russian Doctor Sergei Tsarenko stated that releasing the vaccine early was the better out of 2 options. In his opinion, it was better just to move ahead, as opposed to letting people die.  However, Western doctors were fearful of Russia bypassing stage 3 trials and rushing the drug to market, warning it could have devastating effects.  Abram L. Wagner, Professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan had this to say on a rushed COVID-19 vaccine.  Although it would be wonderful to get a vaccine into the population quickly, there could be substantial downsides if researchers and manufacturers cut corners. Imagine a vaccine that often had serious side effects that weren’t caught in small trials before it was widely administered. Source: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/russia-is-cutting-corners-on-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-heres-why-they-matter  Now it appears, Katerina Tikhonova is the first official fatality of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine. Proving that Sputnik V was not safe, and skipping stage 3 trials was a misguided move on the Kremlin’s part.  The Kremlin is known to spread disinformation, so it is likely it will lie about Putin’s daughter’s death, or else blame her death on something other than the vaccine.  *Disclaimer: This article has been labelled as a Conspiracy File,  and does not necessarily reflect the views of Toronto Today.

According to Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown “There has been vandalism, there have been fires set, there have been stores broken into & looted. According to what was reported to me, that individual was a key major instigator of people engaging in those activities.”  Mr. Gugino’s Twitter Account is also filled with anti-cop sentiment [SEE HERE]. Last Thursday Gugino traveled from his New York home in Amherst, to Buffalo where he was seen on camera agitating a protest crowd. One of the protesters earlier remarked that Mr. Gugino was “acting like an asshole”, and “trying to get punched in the face.”  During his effort Gugino was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers. CTH noted what he was attempting on Thursday night as soon as the now viral video was being used by media to sell a police brutality narrative. [Thread Here] Today, a more clear video has emerged that shows exactly what he was attempting.  In this slow motion video, you will see Gugino using a phone as a capture scanner. You might have heard the term “skimming”; it’s essentially the same. Watch him use his right hand to first scan the mic of officer one top left of chest. Then Gugino moves his hand to the communications belt of the second officer. WATCH CLOSELY:  .  The capture of communications signals [explained in detail here] is a method of police tracking used by Antifa to monitor the location of police.

6a43c794,"Covid-19 had us all fooled, but now we might have finally found its secret. libertymavenstock Follow Apr 5 · 8 min read  In the last 3–5 days, a mountain of anecdotal evidence has come out of NYC, Italy, Spain, etc. about COVID-19 and characteristics of patients who get seriously ill. It’s not only piling up but now leading to a general field-level consensus backed up by a few previously little-known studies that we’ve had it all wrong the whole time. Well, a few had some things eerily correct cough Trump cough, especially with Hydroxychloroquine with Azithromicin, but we’ll get to that in a minute.  There is no ‘pneumonia’ nor ARDS. At least not the ARDS with established treatment protocols and procedures we’re familiar with. Ventilators are not only the wrong solution, but high pressure intubation can actually wind up causing more damage than without, not to mention complications from tracheal scarring and ulcers given the duration of intubation often required… They may still have a use in the immediate future for patients too far to bring back with this newfound knowledge, but moving forward a new treatment protocol needs to be established so we stop treating patients for the wrong disease.  The past 48 hours or so have seen a huge revelation: COVID-19 causes prolonged and progressive hypoxia starving your body of oxygen by binding to the heme groups in hemoglobin in your red blood cells. People are simply desaturating losing o2 in their blood, and that’s what eventually leads to organ failures that kill them, not any form of ARDS or pneumonia. All the damage to the lungs you see in CT scans are from the release of oxidative iron from the hemes, this overwhelms the natural defenses against pulmonary oxidative stress and causes that nice, always-bilateral ground glass opacity in the lungs. Patients returning for re-hospitalization days or weeks after recovery suffering from apparent delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy strengthen the notion COVID-19 patients are suffering from hypoxia despite no signs of respiratory ‘tire out’ or fatigue.  Here’s the breakdown of the whole process, including some ELI5-level cliff notes. Much has been simplified just to keep it digestible and layman-friendly.  Your red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to all your organs and the rest of your body. Red blood cells can do this thanks to hemoglobin, which is a protein consisting of four “hemes”. Hemes have a special kind of iron ion, which is normally quite toxic in its free form, locked away in its center with a porphyrin acting as it’s ‘container’. In this way, the iron ion can be ‘caged’ and carried around safely by the hemoglobin, but used to bind to oxygen when it gets to your lungs.  When the red blood cell gets to the alveoli, or the little sacs in your lungs where all the gas exchange happens, that special little iron ion can flip between FE2+ and FE3+ states with electron exchange and bond to some oxygen, then it goes off on its little merry way to deliver o2 elsewhere.  Here’s where COVID-19 comes in. Its glycoproteins bond to the heme, and in doing so that special and toxic oxidative iron ion is “disassociated” released. It’s basically let out of the cage and now freely roaming around on its own. This is bad for two reasons:  1 Without the iron ion, hemoglobin can no longer bind to oxygen. Once all the hemoglobin is impaired, the red blood cell is essentially turned into a Freightliner truck cab with no trailer and no ability to store its cargo.. it is useless and just running around with COVID-19 virus attached to its porphyrin. All these useless trucks running around not delivering oxygen is what starts to lead to desaturation, or watching the patient’s spo2 levels drop. It is INCORRECT to assume traditional ARDS and in doing so, you’re treating the WRONG DISEASE. Think of it a lot like carbon monoxide poisoning, in which CO is bound to the hemoglobin, making it unable to carry oxygen. In those cases, ventilators aren’t treating the root cause; the patient’s lungs aren’t ‘tiring out’, they’re pumping just fine. The red blood cells just can’t carry o2, end of story. Only in this case, unlike CO poisoning in which eventually the CO can break off, the affected hemoglobin is permanently stripped of its ability to carry o2 because it has lost its iron ion. The body compensates for this lack of o2 carrying capacity and deliveries by having your kidneys release hormones like erythropoietin, which tell your bone marrow factories to ramp up production on new red blood cells with freshly made and fully functioning hemoglobin. This is the reason you find elevated hemoglobin and decreased blood oxygen saturation as one of the 3 primary indicators of whether the shit is about to hit the fan for a particular patient or not.  2 That little iron ion, along with millions of its friends released from other hemes, are now floating through your blood freely. As I mentioned before, this type of iron ion is highly reactive and causes oxidative damage. It turns out that this happens to a limited extent naturally in our bodies and we have cleanup & defense mechanisms to keep the balance. The lungs, in particular, have 3 primary defenses to maintain “iron homeostasis”, 2 of which are in the alveoli, those little sacs in your lungs we talked about earlier. The first of the two are little macrophages that roam around and scavenge up any free radicals like this oxidative iron. The second is a lining on the walls called the epithelial surface which has a thin layer of fluid packed with high levels of antioxidant molecules.. things like abscorbic acid AKA Vitamin C among others. Well, this is usually good enough for naturally occurring rogue iron ions but with COVID-19 running rampant your body is now basically like a progressive state letting out all the prisoners out of the prisons… it’s just too much iron and it begins to overwhelm your lungs’ countermeasures, and thus begins the process of pulmonary oxidative stress. This leads to damage and inflammation, which leads to all that nasty stuff and damage you see in CT scans of COVID-19 patient lungs. Ever noticed how it’s always bilateral? both lungs at the same time Pneumonia rarely ever does that, but COVID-19 does… EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  — — — — — — — — — — — — -  Once your body is now running out of control, with all your oxygen trucks running around without any freight, and tons of this toxic form of iron floating around in your bloodstream, other defenses kick in. While your lungs are busy with all this oxidative stress they can’t handle, and your organs are being starved of o2 without their constant stream of deliveries from red blood cell’s hemoglobin, and your liver is attempting to do its best to remove the iron and store it in its ‘iron vault’. Only its getting overwhelmed too. It’s starved for oxygen and fighting a losing battle from all your hemoglobin letting its iron free, and starts crying out “help, I’m taking damage!” by releasing an enzyme called alanine aminotransferase ALT. BOOM, there is your second of 3 primary indicators of whether the shit is about to hit the fan for a particular patient or not.  Eventually, if the patient’s immune system doesn’t fight off the virus in time before their blood oxygen saturation drops too low, ventilator or no ventilator, organs start shutting down. No fuel, no work. The only way to even try to keep them going is max oxygen, even a hyperbaric chamber if one is available on 100% oxygen at multiple atmospheres of pressure, just to give what’s left of their functioning hemoglobin a chance to carry enough o2 to the organs and keep them alive. Yeah we don’t have nearly enough of those chambers, so some fresh red blood cells with normal hemoglobin in the form of a transfusion will have to do.  The core point being, treating patients with the iron ions stripped from their hemoglobin rendering it abnormally nonfunctional with ventilator intubation is futile, unless you’re just hoping the patient’s immune system will work its magic in time. The root of the illness needs to be addressed.  Best case scenario? Treatment regimen early, before symptoms progress too far. Hydroxychloroquine more on that in a minute, I promise with Azithromicin has shown fantastic, albeit critics keep mentioning ‘anecdotal’ to describe the mountain, promise and I’ll explain why it does so well next. But forget straight-up plasma with antibodies, that might work early but if the patient is too far gone they’ll need more. They’ll need all the blood: antibodies and red blood cells. No help in sending over a detachment of ammunition to a soldier already unconscious and bleeding out on the battlefield, you need to send that ammo along with some hemoglobin-stimulant-magic so that he can wake up and fire those shots at the enemy.  The story with Hydroxychloroquine  All that hilariously misguided and counterproductive criticism the media piled on chloroquine purely for political reasons as a viable treatment will now go down as the biggest Fake News blunder to rule them all. The media actively engaged their activism to fight ‘bad orange man’ at the cost of thousands of lives. Shame on them.  How does chloroquine work? Same way as it does for malaria. You see, malaria is this little parasite that enters the red blood cells and starts eating hemoglobin as its food source. The reason chloroquine works for malaria is the same reason it works for COVID-19 — while not fully understood, it is suspected to bind to DNA and interfere with the ability to work magic on hemoglobin. The same mechanism that stops malaria from getting its hands on hemoglobin and gobbling it up seems to do the same to COVID-19 essentially little snippets of DNA in an envelope from binding to it. On top of that, Hydroxychloroquine an advanced descendant of regular old chloroquine lowers the pH which can interfere with the replication of the virus. Again, while the full details are not known, the entire premise of this potentially ‘game changing’ treatment is to prevent hemoglobin from being interfered with, whether due to malaria or COVID-19.  No longer can the media and armchair pseudo-physicians sit in their little ivory towers, proclaiming “DUR so stoopid, malaria is bacteria, COVID-19 is virus, anti-bacteria drug no work on virus!”. They never got the memo that a drug doesn’t need to directly act on the pathogen to be effective. Sometimes it’s enough just to stop it from doing what it does to hemoglobin, regardless of the means it uses to do so.  Anyway, enough of the rant. What’s the end result here? First, the ventilator emergency needs to be re-examined. If you’re putting a patient on a ventilator because they’re going into a coma and need mechanical breathing to stay alive, okay we get it. Give ’em time for their immune systems to pull through. But if they’re conscious, alert, compliant — keep them on O2. Max it if you have to. If you HAVE to inevitably ventilate, do it at low pressure but max O2. Don’t tear up their lungs with max PEEP, you’re doing more harm to the patient because you’re treating the wrong disease.  Ideally, some form of treatment needs to happen to:  Inhibit viral growth and replication. Here plays CHQ+ZPAK+ZINC or other retroviral therapies being studies. Less virus, less hemoglobin losing its iron, less severity and damage. Therapies used for anyone with abnormal hemoglobin or malfunctioning red blood cells. Blood transfusions. Whatever, I don’t know the full breadth and scope because I’m not a physician. But think along those lines, and treat the real disease. If you’re thinking about giving them plasma with antibodies, maybe if they’re already in bad shape think again and give them BLOOD with antibodies, or at least blood followed by plasma with antibodies. Now that we know more about how this virus works and affects our bodies, a whole range of options should open up. Don’t trust China. China is ASSHOE. disclaimer: not talking about the people, just talking about the regime. They covered this up and have caused all kinds of death and carnage, both literal and economic.

Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them. After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5,000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before.

b29fa73f,"When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee and Commerce Committee joint hearing Tuesday, I asked a relatively simple question: does Facebook consider itself a neutral public forum?  Zuckerberg said that Facebook is a “platform for all ideas,” but declined to give a “yes” or “no” answer. The problem is, this is not merely an academic distinction between words. Facebook’s answer to the question could affect millions of users, and attract or prevent a lot of attention from federal regulators.  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act CDA states: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.  This is a good provision. It means that, for example, if you run a blogging platform and someone posts a terrorist threat in the comments section, you’re not treated as the person making the threat. Without Section 230, many social media networks could be functionally unable to operate.  In order to be protected by Section 230, companies like Facebook should be “neutral public forums.” On the flip side, they should be considered to be a “publisher or speaker” of user content if they pick and choose what gets published or spoken.  As I expressed to Mark Zuckerberg, as a private business Facebook has a clear First Amendment right to publish whatever it wants on its website within the bounds of the law. The company can support political causes and oppose ones it disagrees with, just like a private citizen can speak his or her mind or agitate against opposing views.  But if Facebook is busy censoring legal, protected speech for political reasons, the company should be held accountable for the posts it lets through. And it should not enjoy any special congressional immunity from liability for its actions.  As we discussed at the Senate hearing, for years it has been evident that Facebook has actively censored or suppressed conservative speech.  In May 2016, Gizmodo reported that Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from trending news, including stories about the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC, Mitt Romney and Obama administration scandals.  Facebook’s actions have ranged from seemingly petty things – like shutting down a “Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day” to blocking posts from journalists, specific religious groups and most recently, grassroots Trump supporters Diamond and Silk.  Facebook’s explanation for limiting access to a popular page with 1.3 million Facebook followers was that it was “unsafe to the community.” Many Americans see this as just the latest poor excuse in a pervasive pattern of political bias.  While such stories abound, it is virtually unheard of to see any ads or pages from liberal groups like Planned Parenthood, Moveon.org, or Democratic candidates being targeted for removal.  Whether you call it targeting, censorship, or shadow-banning, these are not the actions of a “neutral public forum.”  Zuckerberg told the Senate hearing that his goal is “not to engage in political speech.” But if a company allows a politically biased corporate culture to persist – and deliberately avoids diversity of thought in its hires – its actions can very quickly escalate into the political realm and endanger its status as a true “platform for all ideas.”  According to Zuckerberg, Facebook employs over 15,000 people in security and content review. If all or virtually all are left-wing Democrats – and if they are empowered to secretly silence the voices of all with whom they disagree – that poses profound threats to our democratic discourse.  Newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, at the height of yellow journalism, never possessed such unchecked power over free speech.  Zuckerberg proved a good sport for responding to reams of questions from 43 senators for five hours. I commend him for admitting that Silicon Valley “is an extremely left-leaning place” and committing to “making sure that we don’t have any bias in the work that we do.”  It is critical that Facebook and other tech platforms take these realizations to heart, because surrendering their status as neutral public forum – engaging in discrimination of political viewpoints – invites government oversight and regulation of social media. This is something that nobody wants and it invites revoking the company’s immunity from liability.  The free exchange of ideas and information on the Internet over the last 25 years has produced a cultural, technological and educational revolution to rival the Wright brothers or nuclear energy. Our largest forums for that continuing exchange should do all they can to keep it a free one, unburdened by censorship or government intrusion.",Sen.

As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing… by Mike Adams of Natural News Natural News The Canadian government, on its official acquisition website Buyandsell.gc.ca is requesting bids for “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” as part of, “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.” The listing number is 45045-190091/A, and it is found at this link: https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-PD-005-78707 Additional details on the bid include: Reference number: PW-$$PD-005-78707 Solicitation number: 45045-190091/A Region of delivery: National Capital Region Notice type: Notice of Proposed Procurement NPP GSIN: N7520: Office Devices and Accessories Procurement entity: Public Works and Government Services Canada The “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” listing on the Canadian government’s website is explained on the site as “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.” “Guillotine” is a term that describes a mechanical device with a powerful chopping blade that can slice things apart. Although there are industrial uses for cutting devices — such as in the book publishing industry — the term “guillotine” specifically refers to a device intended to execute human beings. As the Cambridge online dictionary explains, “guillotine” is a device that’s used to kill people by cutting off their heads: Here’s an image of a paper cutting machine, which is more commonly called a “shear” or cutting machine. This is not a guillotine, even though paper cutting companies might be used as a front for acquiring actual guillotines: Antifa and left-wing BLM terrorists have recently displayed mock-up guillotines on the streets of America as part of their protest actions, demanding that the people with whom they disagree be executed via guillotine. Guillotines were also used in the French Revolution to execute political dissidents who opposed the incoming socialist regime. Canadian official asks why covid camps are being constructed in Canada, gets silenced It is difficult to imagine how guillotines would be needed to respond to COVID-19 unless Canada was building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit to mass vaccinations. As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing. See this article: Canadian government erecting a network of covid detainment camps and “isolation” sites to incarcerate those who don’t cooperate with medical tyranny. As that article explains: Justin Trudeau and the Canadian government are creating Nazi Germany-like infrastructure to detain human beings en masse, and for years to come. A brave Ontario politician named Randy Hillier spoke out about the government’s nefarious detainment plan in a provincial question period in front of the government of Ontario. His microphone was cut off as soon as he started asking the tough questions. Randy Hillier, Independent Ontario MPP for Lanark, Frontenac and Kingston, stood up and questioned the government, asking how many people will be detained and how many concentration camps are scheduled for construction. He expressed concern about their current use — to control the spread of covid-19 — and pointed out in documentation that these sites could be used for “other requirements” in the future. “So your government must be in negotiations and aware of these plans to potentially detain and isolate citizens and residents of our country and our province,” Hillier began. “So speaker, to the Premier, where will these camps be built, how many people will be detained, and for what reason, for what reasons can people be kept in these isolation camps, and I’d like to have the Premier assure the people of Ontario…,” Hillier’s microphone was cut off before he could finish. See the video here, which has been banned from YouTube: Additional details on the hydraulic guillotines request from the Canadian government Solicitation document #ABES.PROD.PW__PD.B005.E78707.EBSU000 reveals additional details about the bid request: The bid document lists technical requirements for the guillotines, under a heading called “Guillotines Mandatory Requirements:” The Guillotine’s cutting and clamping systems must be fully hydraulic; The Guillotine’s automatic blade and clamp must return from every position to its original starting position; starting position; The Guillotine’s blade depth adjustments must be achievable from outside of the Guillotine; Guillotine; The Guillotine’s measurement readout must be in imperial measurement; The Guillotine’s blade changing tool, wrenches/screwdrivers and cutting block must be provided for each Guillotine; The document also calls for a “1 year parts and labour warranty” to make sure the guillotine continues running smoothly so that the chopping isn’t interrupted. Is this bid for industrial use, or something more sinister? A skeptic might look at this government bid and conclude it must be a bid for cutting equipment to be used in cutting books, stacks of papers or posters. One of the companies involved in the bid appears to be a printing company, for example. But wouldn’t that also be the perfect cover story for acquiring actual guillotines intended for a more sinister purpose? Given that Canada is already in the process of constructing covid “concentration camps” — while touting this guillotine bid as part of “Canada’s response to COVID-19,” many people will have serious questions about the intended use of these devices as well as the language used to describe them. If these were merely industrial cutting machines, wouldn’t the listing just say, “Cutting Machine” instead of “Guillotines?” And given the history of guillotines being used during radical left-wing revolutions in France, many people are wondering whether China’s corruption of modern-day Canada — including its French-speaking regions — means that China is planning to round up and execute anyone resisting communist influences in Canada. With Justin Trudeau now appearing to be a political puppet of China — much like Joe Biden — and with Chinese troops already staged in Western Canada, these are no longer idle questions. See this important story: Western Canada has already fallen to Communist China – America may have a chance, but only if it stands united. Dave Hodges of The Commonsense Show recently published an article describing plans to round up Americans and incarcerate them in Canadian concentration camps run by communist Chinese. That article explains: Steve Quayle and myself have been investigating a three-nation deal involving Communist China, Canada and the United States. The deal has now expanded to NATO forces, living in American bases that were closed during the Bush Sr., era. The CSS has also learned that their is some UN involvement as well. The agreements have to do with ridding America’s new Harris-Biden administration of any and all. Unfortunately, the interview that is presented below on this topic is a work in progress. The implications of this interview is frightening as it promises an international, state-sponsored genocidal program against “deplorables” who will oppose the real new world order. As all this is happening, Trudeau is accelerating Canada’s gun control and gun confiscation efforts to make sure that Canadian citizens have no ability to fight back when the government comes to their homes and kidnaps them, depositing them in Canada’s COVID concentration camps. Americans, on the other hand, will never give up their guns.

3742c4ef,"by Taxpayer Association of Oregon  Rep. Matt Wingard and members of Oregon’s House Republican Caucus will shortly unveil a jobs package in anticipation of the upcoming February legislative session. According to Wingard, the series of measures would help stimulate Oregon’s lagging economy and create tens of thousands of jobs.  “Oregon’s per capita income is nine percent below the national average and getting worse. This is a state that’s actually getting poorer. My Republican colleagues and I are determined to change that trajectory.”  Wingard, who called the Legislature’s failure to pass meaningful jobs legislation the biggest disappointment of the last session, believes that the jobs package must be priority number of one in February. Specifics are still being worked out, but efforts will focus on leveraging Oregon’s vast natural resources and lowering income and capital gains taxes, among other things.  “The abundance of natural resources is the economic engine of Oregon and critical to turning our economy around,” said Wingard, noting that Oregon has lost of over 200,000 jobs during the current economic downturn. “We also have to create a climate that will encourage businesses to grow, as well as to attract other businesses to relocate to our state. “  Wingard said that House Republicans have reached out to businesses and communities around the state for ideas and to build support. The jobs package will likely encourage the responsible harvesting of trees, utilizing water resources from the Columbia River, as well attracting data centers to Oregon similar to the one recently built by Facebook in Prineville.

906b5aa2,"Why does Dr. Anthony Fauci’s name appear on 4 U.S. patents for a key glycoprotein that appears to have been inserted into a SARS virus chassis to create the current COVID-19 epidemic?  The legal portal Justia.com lists the following “patents by inventor Anthony S. Fauci” involving a glycoprotein found in the HIV-1, a disease that attacks the human immune system, leading to the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, more commonly known as AIDS. In 1990, Fauci held the same position at the NIH that he holds today. Fauci made his mark around the anti-viral medications that were developed by Big Pharma to combat the AIDS epidemic raging at that time.  This same glycoprotein, identified as Glycoprotein 120, or simply as GP120, has also been found to be a key component of the current COVID-19, a disease that appears to combine a HIV-1 attack on the human immune system, with SARS CoV-1, the pathogen from the original SARS “Severe Acute Respiratory System” that created an international pandemic in 2002-2003. The pathogen in COVID-19 is named SARS CoV-2 in medical scientific literature.  The four patents on which Fauci is named as an inventor are the following:  Patent Number: 9896509, patent granted August 3, 2016. “Use of antagonists of the interaction between HIV120 and ?4?7 integrin.  Publication Number: 20160333309, patent application filed August 3, 2016. “Use of Antagonists of the Interaction Between HIV GP120 and A4B7 Integrin.  Patent Number: 9441041, patent granted September 13, 2016. “Use of antagonists between HIV GP120 and ?4?7 integrin.”  Publication Number 2016007586, patent application filed September 21, 2015. “Use of antagonists of the Interaction Between HIV GP120 and A4B7 Integrin.”  An article published by a group of medical scientists in India in the medical science journal BioRXiv in January 2020 was entitled “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCov spike protein to HIV-1 and Gag.”  In a highly controversial finding, the medical scientists in India reported: “We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein S which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-Gag, all of which have identity/similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.”  The article almost immediately was withdrawn after disinformation experts recognized the medical scientists in India were suggesting that COVID-19 was created by inserting the particular glycoprotein from the HIV-1 disease that involve patents held by or applied for by Fauci. Even more upsetting to disinformation operatives was the suggestion that the insertion of these 4 inserts into a SARS virus is not likely to occur in nature.  The clear suggestion was that COVID-19 was laboratory-created, possibly as a bioweapon, and that the creator of the virus used GP120 to do so, a glycoprotein from the HIV-1 1990s era that tied back to Fauci.",Why Does Fauci Hold Patents on a Key HIV Component Used to Create COVID-19,FALSE
b906fccf,"The United Nations is using coronavirus aid to fund abortions in Ecuador, pro-life leaders in the country claim. The Catholic News Agency reports the country’s Ministry of Foreign Relations and Human Mobility recently asked for $46.4 million in aid from the UN Humanitarian Response Plan COVID-19. Within that UN funding package, however, is a goal to “maintain continuity of maternal, neonatal and children’s health and other sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic,” including abortions, according to the report. “[Our] fear is that our highest authority in Ecuador will even consider accepting this economic shakedown of $46 million in exchange for the lives of thousands of unborn children,” Martha Villafuerte of the pro-life Guayaquil Family Network told ACI Prensa. The Guayaquil Family Network and other pro-life organizations recently began a petition urging President Lenin Moreno to reject the abortion agenda within the aid, according to the report. “It goes against the Constitution, specifically article 45, which guarantees the right to life from conception, a right that was ratified last September 17 at the plenary session of the National Assembly,” Villafuerte said. HELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation! Villafuerte said the UN plan would give Ecuador $46.4 million, but $3 million of that aid would be used to train “health personnel on safe, legal abortion and post-abortion care.” Some lawmakers are speaking out against the abortion agenda, too. “Unbelievable! The UN conditions ‘safe legal abortion’ in its humanitarian support plan for Ecuador,” Assemblyman Héctor Yépez wrote on Twitter. “While we all want to save lives, some insist on eliminating the lives of unborn girls and boys.” UPDATE 5/26/20: The Ecuadorian government has assured Yépez that funds would not be used to legalize abortions and would only be spent in accordance with current laws. In statements to ACI Prensa, legislator Yépez referred to the Foreign Ministry’s response. “The objective of preventing them from executing what the UN wanted, which was an attempt to advance abortion, was achieved, but now they come out with a pun to wash their faces, in which they say that they were only referring to what it was already established in the Comprehensive Organic Penal Code ”. “I think the objective has been met, having discovered the intent, and with this letter they themselves are ensuring that they are not going to execute anything outside of what the law says in Ecuador, which is what we were looking for,” he stressed. However, Yépez urged “to remain very vigilant so that the COVID-19 Humanitarian Response Plan is not distorted.” The United Nations has faced prior international criticism for pushing abortions as part of its response to the coronavirus. Jonathan Abbamonte of the Population Research Institute wrote more about it earlier this month: The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA has also been urging governments to ensure uninterrupted access to abortion during the pandemic. An interim technical brief recently issued by UNFPA calls on governments to: “Ensure women’s and girls’ choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health is respected regardless of their COVID-19 status, including access to contraception, emergency contraception, safe abortion to the full extent of the law.” The technical brief also advises governments to “encourage” women who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection to seek abortion services “to the full extent of the law.” This seems a backhanded way of saying that, when women come to African health clinics to be treated for the coronavirus, they should also be propagandized about the benefits of abortion. Health care in Africa has often been directly tied to population control programs in this way. The WHO also faced heavy criticism from pro-life leaders this spring when it falsely claimed abortion is an essential service during the coronavirus pandemic. President Donald Trump stopped giving United States tax dollars to the United Nations Population Fund in 2017, and, in April, he halted funding to the World Health Organization WHO.

7bc541e6,"Please Share This Story! Dr. Russell Blaylock warns that not only do face masks fail to protect the healthy from getting sick, but they also create serious health risks to the wearer. The bottom line is that if you are not sick, you should not wear a face mask. As businesses reopen, many are requiring shoppers and employees to wear a face mask. Costco, for instance, will not allow shoppers into the store without wearing a face mask. Many employers are requiring all employees to wear a face mask while at work. In some jurisdictions, all citizens must wear a face mask if they are outside of their own home. ? TN Editor With the advent of the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. One of these measures is the wearing of facial masks, either a surgical-type mask, bandana or N95 respirator mask. When this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior, it was assumed that it would behave, in terms of spread among communities, like other respiratory viruses. Little has presented itself after intense study of this virus and its behavior to change this perception. This is somewhat of an unusual virus in that for the vast majority of people infected by the virus, one experiences either no illness asymptomatic or very little sickness. Only a very small number of people are at risk of a potentially serious outcome from the infection—mainly those with underlying serious medical conditions in conjunction with advanced age and frailty, those with immune compromising conditions and nursing home patients near the end of their lives. There is growing evidence that the treatment protocol issued to treating doctors by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, mainly intubation and use of a ventilator respirator, may have contributed significantly to the high death rate in these select individuals. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. Russell Blaylock, MD As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, “ None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”1 Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission. It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history. Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications. There is a difference between the N95 respirator mask and the surgical mask cloth or paper mask in terms of side effects. The N95 mask, which filters out 95% of particles with a median diameter >0.3 µm2 , because it impairs respiratory exchange breathing to a greater degree than a soft mask, and is more often associated with headaches. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers 47 males and 165 females asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.2 How is Coronavirus Getting Into the Brain? Vaccine Reaction They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation hypoxia or an elevation in blood C02 hypercapnia. It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death. A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask.3 Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance. Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind—which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung. While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well. In this study, researchers examined the blood oxygen levels in 53 surgeons using an oximeter. They measured blood oxygenation before surgery as well as at the end of surgeries.4 The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels pa02 significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels. The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels hypoxia is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 HIF-1, which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.5,6,7 People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers.8,9 Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular heart attacks and cerebrovascular strokes diseases.10 There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number. It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain.11,12 In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves smell nerves, which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.13 It is evident from this review that there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mask of any kind can have a significant impact in preventing the spread of this virus. The fact that this virus is a relatively benign infection for the vast majority of the population and that most of the at-risk group also survive, from an infectious disease and epidemiological standpoint, by letting the virus spread through the healthier population we will reach a herd immunity level rather quickly that will end this pandemic quickly and prevent a return next winter. During this time, we need to protect the at-risk population by avoiding close contact, boosting their immunity with compounds that boost cellular immunity and in general, care for them. One should not attack and insult those who have chosen not to wear a mask, as these studies suggest that is the wise choice to make. References bin-Reza F et al.

7db350af,"November 8, 2016. That's the next possible date for another LGBT barrier to be broken in Georgia—getting an openly gay man elected to the state legislature. Roughly a dozen have tried and failed in the last decade, with three going down last November Rashad Taylor came out while in office in 2011, but subsequently lost in his 2012 bid for re-election. Up next to try are Rafer Johnson and Josh Noblitt.  Johnson, a flight attendant at Delta Air Lines and a community advocate, announced his bid for the House District 62 seat in April. But it wasn't the first time he's considered running for office.  A few years ago he went through campaign training with the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, a political action committee dedicated to getting openly LGBT people elected to public office. A seat opened on the Fulton County Commission after that, but he passed on running.  When state Rep. Ladawn Blackett Jones D-Atlanta announced earlier this year that she would not be running again for the HD62 seat in 2016, Johnson started encouraging others to run, but they told him he should do it instead. Johnson says he told his husband, Kelly Johnson, a board member with Georgia Equality, about the responses, and Kelly pulled out an application to run for the seat that was already filled out.  “He told me, 'We've all been discussing this, we've just been waiting for you to get to the answer,'” says Johnson, who is making economic growth the centerpiece of his campaign.  He is no stranger to public service, having served as the chair of Fulton County's Housing Authority, national co-chair of the Black Gay Men's Network and as a board member for Atlanta Pride.  Johnson laments the fact that no openly gay man has been elected to the legislature, saying, “We've got to break that lavender ceiling so that we have the best and the brightest serving the entire state.”  But he sees Georgia as being in the midst of a transition on LGBT issues. Voters will decide whether he's right next November.  Public safety centerpiece of hate crime victim Noblitt's campaign  Some say a higher power might be needed to get an openly gay man elected to the Georgia legislature. Enter Josh Noblitt, the openly gay Minister of Social Justice at Saint Mark United Methodist Church, who announced his candidacy for the House District 59 seat in May.  Noblitt is close with the current holder of the seat, state Rep. Margaret Kaiser D-Atlanta, and has even shadowed her two or three times each legislative session over the last few years. When Kaiser announced in March that she would forego a 2016 reelection effort and instead make a run for mayor in 2017, Noblitt stepped in to announce his run.  Citing his position as president of his neighborhood association and as vice chair of his neighborhood planning unit, Noblitt says, “I've just really enjoyed that level of civic engagement and it just felt like a really logical next step for me.”  Noblitt made headlines in 2010 after being attacked at gunpoint along with his then-partner in an anti-gay hate crime in Piedmont Park. The attack eventually led to the formation of an Atlanta Police LGBT Advisory Board, of which Noblitt was a member. The board, however, has fallen off in recent years.  He's making public safety the centerpiece of his campaign, citing his “unique interaction with the criminal justice system” considering his role as a victim in the hate crime, his previous work in the Georgia Public Defender's Office and current role as chaplain for the Atlanta Police Department.  “Having those three unique perspectives and also being the president of my neighborhood association and hearing complaints from neighbors around public safety issues, I feel like I have a lot to bring to the table around that particular issue,” says Noblitt, who has raised just over $30,000 as of a June 30 campaign finance report.  In recent years, Noblitt has been an outspoken advocate for LGBT equality, speaking at numerous marriage equality rallies as well as at many rallies opposing Georgia’s so-called “religious freedom” bill.  He doesn't know why an openly gay man has yet to be elected to the legislature, saying it's hard to compare his election with previous elections since all have been in different districts with different demographics and candidates; but he remains hopeful.  “The times are very different even from one year ago. We've got marriage equality, we've got the end of DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act], we've got all kinds of advancements happening in a way that's changing hearts and minds of folks around LGBT issues.”  The Candidates  Rafer Johnson  House District 62, which includes portions of College Park, Douglasville, East Point and unincorporated portions of Fulton and Douglas counties.

c460b4ee,"Nation  PROOF: The Novel Coronavirus Infecting the World is a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army  The novel Coronavirus outbreak affecting China and many other countries right now, has been determined to be a military BIO-WEAPON, which was being worked on at the Wuhan Virology Laboratory by China's People's Liberation Army, Nanjiang Command. Somehow, it got out. The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result.  The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below. The evidence is irrefutable.  Two separate components of genetic sequencing from HIV-1, the virus which causes AIDS, were added to Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus in the laboratory, thereby allowing it to infect human lungs via the ACES2 receptors in our lungs, and to disrupt the human body ability to fight it off, by reducing human leukocytes.  BIO-WEAPON PROOF  Make no mistake: this disease is, in fact, a MILITARY biological weapon. The disease sequence from the original Bat coronavirus was uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine, in the year 2018 by China's Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjing Command. The image below from the National Center for Biotechnology Information proves the upload Click image to enlarge:  That Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus was issued Reference ID: AVP 70833.1 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the U.S. Library of Medicine.  The present outbreak of novel Coronavirus was uploaded to that same National Center for Biotechnology Information in January of this year by the Shanghai Public Heath Clinical Center and was issued Reference ID: QHD3418.1. Here is proof of THAT upload Click image to enlarge:  Using the test facilities known as BLAST Basic Local Alignment Search Tool from the U.S. National Library of Medicine researchers have determined that the virus envelope of those two separate diseases, are 100% identical! Here is the BLAST Test result Click image to enlarge:  MORE: a new study shows that elements of HIV have been found in the new novel coronavirus! From that study:  We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019- nCoV. The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein S which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.  LINK TO STUDY HERE  There is no way in nature that the Bat coronavirus could fortuitously acquire the HIV genetic sequences, without causing a mutation of the Virus Envelope. The ONLY way the virus envelope could obtain the HIV genetics and still remain 100% identical to the 2018 sample, is if the HIV genes were added in a laboratory.  So what the human race is now facing, is an accidentally-released military bio-weapon. The original Bat-SARS-Like Coronavirus was identified by China's People's Liberation Army, through the Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjiang Command in the year 2018. They uploaded the virus sequence and they were the sole entity in possession of the virus.  Here we are, two years later, and the virus they had has been changed in a way that cannot occur in nature without mutating the virus envelope protein.  This isn't rocket science; this is as plain as day. China conducted genetic manipulation of their Bat-SARS-like virus and created a new virus capable of infecting humans. That new virus was apparently accidentally-released and is the novel coronavirus the world is now battling.  I am sorry to have to report, many of us are very likely to LOSE this battle. Just like many are already losing their battle inside China and elsewhere.  QUARANTINE  Within the first month of this outbreak in China, the government there effectively QUARANTINED more than fifty-six MILLION people 56,000,000 in nineteen 19 major cities, even though China reported publicly that only a few hundred were infected and only about 25 had died by that time.  WHY?  Why would China lockdown 19 cities and effectively Quarantine 56 Million people for such a trivial disease? Because China KNEW it wasn't trivial. China KNEW it was a military bio-weapon which had accidentally gotten out. And China also KNEW how far this would spread and how fast. China is guilty as sin.  DISEASE FACTS:  Here are the now-established FACTS about this disease:  This disease has an eighty-three percent 83% infection rate. That means if 100 people are EXPOSED to this virus, 83 WILL get sick from it.  The Disease can spread by AIR. It is HIGHLY, HIGHLY contagious.  When a person breathes, virus comes out with those breaths. Same thing when a person sneezes or coughs. Same when urinating or having a bowel movement. ALL OF IT HAS VIRUS IN IT.  The virus can live OUTSIDE a person, in the air or on a surface, for a minimum of five days, and a maximum of twenty eight days.  So if an infected person goes into a store or supermarket, or public bathroom, or a school, office, warehouse . . . . or anywhere . . . . touches products on shelves and puts anything back, or sneezes or coughs, his virus gets on the products in that store or supermarket, bathroom, school, office, warehouse, etc., and can survive.  YOU walk-in a couple minutes, hours or even DAYS later, and pick up the same item, or even smell their stink in the bathroom - POW, you're infected.  WORSE: This virus can infect others through the eyes and ears.  Let's say you're walking inside somewhere and an infected person was there minutes earlier and coughed or sneezed. The cough or sneeze threw microscopic droplets into the air, which float for awhile. A few minutes later, you walk through that air. One or more of the microscopic droplets gets on your eye. You don't even KNOW it because the things are so small.  You blink. We all blink.  Your eye lid pushes the virus off the surface of your eye, down into the bottom eye area, and the virus washes down into your tear duct. POW- you're infected.  It cannot be overstated that this virus is the worst public disease crisis the world has faced in over 100 years. Not since the Spanish Flu of 1918 has the world faced such death and this is already heading toward being far WORSE than the Spanish Flu.  The Spanish Flu spread worldwide during 1918-1919. In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.  When a disease outbreak occurs, one of the measurements that scientists use to see how badly the disease will spread is known as R 0.  The 1918-1919 pandemic-causing Spanish flu is estimated to have had an R 0 ranging from 1.4 – 2.8, with a mean of 2. This means that for every person infected, that person could be expected to infect another 1.4 to 2.8 additional people.  I regret to report that the R 0 of this Bio-Weapon is already showing itself to be R4.08 . . . FAAAAAAR Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu.  Here's where things get very bad, very fast.  According to Satistia, the number of all hospital beds in the U.S. 1975-2017, is decreasing. In 1975, there were about 1.5 million hospital beds in the U.S., but until 2017 the number dropped to just about 931 thousand. Aug 9, 2019 HERE  According to TrendingEconomics, Hospital beds per 1,000 people in United States was reported at 2.9 in 2013, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Here  Using the Infection Rate of 83% listed above, out of 1,000 people exposed to this Bio-Weapon, 830 will become infected.  There are 2.9 Hospital beds per thousand US citizens. So when 830 people get infected, how many can those 2.9 hospital beds hold??????? Yea. 2.9  What happens to the rest? They cannot get hospital care.  Right now, when a person cannot get hospital care for this disease, the death rate for such people is 65-70%.  That means me and you. Dead.  IT CAN AND PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN HERE  Many of the 56 Million people in 19 Quarantined cities have not eaten in days because there is no food remaining in the cities. This is causing rioting.  Delivery trucks are prohibited from entering these contaminated cities, for fear of spreading the Coronavirus to outlying areas. People are literally FIGHTING each other to get food:  People are trying virtually anything they can to ESCAPE the quarantine, to get food:  Roadblocks erected by bulldozers, bucket loaders and backhoes, consisting of large piles of dirt, rocks, and other obstructions, now appear on most roads into and out of Quarantined cities.  Some of these barriers were erected by government while others were erected by people in small towns and villages to keep the infected OUT.  In the meantime, people throughout China are still simply DROPPING DEAD in their tracks:  In Shopping Malls:  On the public streets:  All over the public street:  In other places, people are engaging in fist fights to get their hands on Filter Masks:  People in some areas are attacking others for merely COMING IN to their neighborhood; WARNING: People hit in head with PIPES:  Those who are not dropping dead, are literally fighting each other for food:  Meanwhile, the lines to just get IN to a hospital are . . . . unimaginable:  OUTSIDE CHINA, people are also dropping dead from this virus.  In Mexico, this poor man waited far too long, until the disease became Hemorrhagic; THIS is how this disease ends GRAPHIC:  Things inside China are getting so bad, Police are now BOARDING-UP People inside their apartments to KEEP THEM IN!  And MORE people Nailed-in to their own homes:  And once the police leave, other people are coming and SETTING THE HOMES ON FIRE to burn the infected people to death!  CHINA ORDERS ALL PETS KILLED  Residential committees, village officials and companies from various provinces and municipalities issued a strict order to locals after receiving instructions from their superiors to tackle the epidemic, it has emerged. They have ordered citizens to get rid of their pets or face having them culled.  One village in Hebei urged all households to 'deal with' their pets within five days, otherwise officials would 'handle' them altogether; while another residential committee in Shaanxi instructed people to 'consider the overall situation' and dispose of their cats and dogs immediately.  China says pets can carry the bio-weapon virus and spread it to others.  China is only about 30 Days into this outbreak, and their entire country and society are already collapsing. What you see above OVER THERE, is just 30 days away from happening OVER HERE.  Are you preparing?  Bear in mind that all this is just ONE MONTH into the outbreak. ONE MONTH!  What we see happening in China, can -- and very likely WILL -- happen here, in America.  Today Saturday February 1 A California man has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the seventh confirmed case in the United States.    The unidentified man is a resident of Santa Clara County, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday afternoon, according to local news reports.    Health officials have documented two other cases in California; two in Illinois; one in Arizona and one in Washington state.  UPDATE 4:43 PM EST -- The eighth confirmed US case of the coronavirus is in a man in his 20s who lives in Boston, according to a press release from Boston and Massachusetts health officials. The man recently returned from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.  Yesterday, The Hal Turner Radio Show was told that Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh had a patient who tested positive for Corona Virus, who had been in the city for over a week, doing business. The source reported that federal government people came and took the patient away, then FORCED Nurses, Doctors and Staff to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements which threatened them with criminal prosecution and prison, if they revealed anything about the existence of this patient to anyone!  Thus, the American people must now start to wonder whether other Doctors, Nurses, and health care providers are being intimidated into staying silent too? FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS, MOST FOLKS DO NOT BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS REGARDING THE NUMBER OF INFECTED OR THE NUMBER OF DEATHS.  Most people who have been following this situation closely say they think we are smack dab in the middle of a global cover-up.    You don't:  - Quarantine around 65 million people figures vary, but multiple large cities in China are involved  - Stop people traveling on highways to check their temperatures  - Extend the Lunar New Year holiday so people don't go back to work  - Delay the start of spring semester classes  - Shut down the stock market    All because 259 people have died. The actions taken by not only China, but by dozens of other countries around the globe, are not a logical response to 259 fatalities.  The best way to avoid this is to protect yourself and your family. Here's how:  HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF  The Medical Infrastructure of the United States and pretty much every other country simply CANNOT HANDLE THIS from the perspective of how many get infected and how fast that happens. There simply are not enough hospital beds, respirators, negative-pressure infectious disease isolation rooms. Once the virus gets here in earnest it probably already is but we won't know for ten days the medical system will be quickly overwhelmed. We could see Medical Infrastructure COLLAPSE here in the USA the same as it is happening in China.  When things go wild weasel here in America, there will be all sorts of unanticipated service disruptions.  The general public remains blissfully unaware of the utter disaster coming at us, because the mass-media is keeping rather quiet about the situation. But when they can't keep quiet any longer, there will be PANIC.  You should PREPARE NOW because once the SHTF, it will be too late.  Here are suggested Preps to try to get yourself and your family through what's coming. There is precious little time left . . .  The best strategy for this is NOT to be exposed. Fat chance of that; we ALL go out: Work, school, shopping, recreation, and so forth.  So how might we protect ourselves while we're out?  Well, the fact this virus can be spread by air, in addition to staying alive on surfaces like counter tops, desks, water fountains, door handles, inside cars and buses, product packages on store shelves that someone else handled, or sneezed-on or coughed-on, - including ones that get delivered by mail, FedEx, UPS, etc. -- complicates things greatly.  Step One: Stay home. Do not go out unless you absolutely MUST.  Step Two: Presuming you have to go out we ALL do wear a filter mask eye and hand protective gear below.  The N-95 filter masks are almost completely sold out already, nationwide. So you can get a better mask rated as N-100 or P-100 for the time being until THEY sell out. Links to various suppliers are HERE-N-95 and HERE N-100. I am NOT the seller  You can also get the VASTLY AVAILABLE 3M 7500 HERE which uses 3M 2091 filters HERE This mask system is more expensive, but it works and is widely still available. Again, I am NOT the seller  Get Eye Protection, either cheap swimmer goggles HERE or better safety goggles HERE  Get a box of rubber/nitrile Gloves Here  Wear this gear when you go out.  Yes, you'll look and feel ridiculous. But you are much more likely to have the last laugh because YOU are protecting yourself.  THIS IS URGENTLY IMPORTANT:  The absolute moment you get home, take off your shoes and leave them in the foyer. DO NOT WALK AROUND YOUR HOUSE IN SHOES YOU WORE OUTSIDE.  You may have walked on a large amount of infected material as you were out and if you wear those shoes in the house, the virus will spread in the house.  Next: Go into the bathroom, take off your clothing, put it in a hamper or plastic bag, and take a shower. You HAVE TO WASH OFF any virus that may have landed on your body or hair, while you were out.  Put on clean garments. You cannot go sit in your chair or lay on your couch or bed in clothing you wore outside. The virus will come off the clothing, onto the furniture and pow, someone in the house catches it.  Make every person in your household do this the absolute moment they come home. This virus is HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS and it KILLS people. We cannot skimp or get lazy protecting ourselves.  Eat right, take vitamins I use Centrum, and, I don't want to sound hokey, or like some Bible thumper, pray to Almighty God that you be protected by Him during this crisis. I'm not kidding. I mean it: PRAY.  Even if you haven't prayed in decades, start now. Hi God, it's me so and so. I know I haven't prayed to you in a long time, but I'm coming back to you now. . . . .  And then talk honestly and earnestly to him, in a very quiet voice.  Just remember, this is God, not a magician to be summoned to do tricks or render services at our beckon call. He made us. We are HIS to do with a HE sees fit.  OTHER PREPS with Links  Have Emergency food HERE, HERE, and HERE in the house in case Quarantine gets implemented, so you and your family can eat for the 6 weeks or so such Quarantines are likely to last.  Have Emergency Water HERE stored up in case the water supply gets contaminated.  Here is a complete list of Preps that folks might consider for themselves.  Please pass this article along to those you care about; No other source is providing this type of self-help advice and there isn't much time left before all hell breaks loose.  UPDATE SUNDAY 10:15 AM EST --  CHINA PUBLICLY DENIES THIS STORY  Chinese experts on Sunday denied rumors that the novel #coronavirus originated from lab-grown samples. Shi Zhengli, Chinese virologist and researcher at the #Wuhan Institute of Virology, said the outbreak was due to improper lifestyle choices rather than sample leaks from a lab. pic.twitter.com/zO4q2JZEeR — People's Daily, China @PDChina February 2, 2020  China is now publicly DENYING the virus outbreak was caused by a leaked virus from the Wuhan Virology lab.

b7db0e10,"Joe Biden won’t be receiving the warm welcome he had hoped for, according to sources close to the Pentagon.  14 generals with a lot of clout have come forward to say that they absolutely will not follow Joe Biden’s orders, no matter what.  These brave men, who include two women and one undecided, say that following the orders of a man like Biden isn’t something they’re willing to do.  One of the generals told Washington Military Daily that there was “no way” he was going to do anything Biden said. The others had similar sentiments, although a couple offered a little clarification.  According to a memo released from the office of General Joe Barron:  “I cannot in good conscience follow orders from Joe Biden. Not because I don’t like him or disagree with his policies, but because I retired 10 years ago. Who the hell is writing this stupid article? All of the people on the list are retired. None of them follow orders from anyone anymore. They’re civilians.”  And there you have it, Patriots. Not one of the 14 generals will bother to listen to Biden at all.  We don’t feel as though the reason is really that relevant, so just never mind. They all said no, and that’s what we’re running with.  Just how the heck does he think he’s gonna run a country if men like these refuse to take orders?  Our military expert, Art Tubolls, says it’s going to be an uphill battle:  “Getting them to listen to orders may be tough. 11 of them are in assisted living facilities, and 4 don’t have any idea who they are — or who Joe Biden is for that matter. “How is the next president going to deal with it? Some say he’ll have a hard time. Others say he’ll focus on active generals who aren’t retired. “Basically, it’s just a big mess.”  One thing is for sure, patriots. Without the support of generals, whether they’re drooling in a cup or not, Biden is destined to fail.",14 Generals Say They Will Never Take Orders From Joe Biden,FALSE
c06b7d1a,"PHILADELPHIA – George Soros has been arrested, and is currently in federal custody in Philadelphia. According to a recently unsealed indictment filed in the West District of Pennsylvania, Soros committed a slew of serious crimes prior to the US election.  The indictment focuses only on the criminal activity Soros participated in prior to the election, such as wire fraud, identity theft, and damage to computers.  The FBI stated that the indictment will likely be updated to reflect election interference charges in relation to Dominion Voting, once the full scale of Soros’ operations is known. Soros is currently being interrogated by the FBI.  It also notable that the judge put a publication ban on Soros’ arrest, however, those laws don’t apply to Canadian Media – like the Conservative Beaver.  Rebel News – a renowned alternative media outlet – previously reported on the connection between George Soros, the Tides Foundation, and Dominion Voting.  According to reporter Keean Bexte,  Dominion Voting has come under fire after their vote tabulation machines created a 6,000 vote swing in a single Michigan state county. The same machines and software were used in every single county in Georgia and in several other swing states that just sent their electoral votes to Joe Biden for now.  Bexte has provided evidence that suggests George Soros may have had a bigger role in the election than previously thought.  The FBI have confirmed they are aware of Soros’ operations in Canada, and have executed a search warrant on Soros’ home and offices in Toronto.  Some have speculated Soros may have rigged Canada’s recent election in Trudeau’s favour.  Check out Dominion voting machines and smartmatic software. I doubt that Trudeau even managed to achieve a minority of the vote in the last election.

39c5f41b,"The Democrats in Congress just never seem to be satisfied. After the months of phony “impeachment” nonsense they put us all through, paid for by dipping into our social security funding, no less, now they’re dead set to cheat their way through the 2020 election. And who better to lead the crooked bandwagon than Little Sally Socialism herself, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Cortez is the author of congressional bill OU812 which would place an upper age-limit on legal voting within the United States to 65. After that age, no citizen would be able to register or even visit a local polling place, and all people currently above that mark would be permanently struck from the rolls immediately. The bill is gaining momentum in the Congress and is likely to pass, and with several Republicans in the Senate already beginning to turn against the conservative movement, it stands a good chance of becoming law. Cortez explained the reasoning behind the bill to a crowd gathered outside of her local nail-art emporium in Blumpkinville, New York:  “So, it’s like, old people – a lot of them get kind of dopey, you know? In their minds? They get Demen-entia. Or that really terrible one, Wisenheimer’s. And then they can’t make decisions very well. That’s why we end up with a professional con man like Trump, right? And then we have to go through all this trouble to impeach him and throw him out and fix their mistake, and it’s not fair. So I figure it could be eliminated altogether if we just stop them from voting stupid. They wont know. We can like, send them little pieces of paper, and they can write ‘Trump’ on them and we can just pat their heads and tell them we’ll put it in the voting car and it’ll drive it to the voting house or whatever. They won’t know the difference. Everyone happy. Okay, I have to go because I heard the new line of Hot Emoticon nail art is out and it’s SOOO delish.”  Experts agree that if the bill passes fairly soon, it will nearly destroy President Trump’s voting base and chances for re-election. But then again, experts also agreed that Killery was going to win in 2016, isn’t that right patriots? And you know, she basically did, but only for the grace of the electoral college, designed exactly for that reason by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Himself. We can only hope and pray that should this bill see the light of day, God will find another way to give America the mentally handicapped President she deserves.

803bdfbf,"This really should be one of the biggest public health scandals of the decade, but instead it’s given little attention – mainly because of the high-profile nature of the people and organisations involved. *** The United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing a deadly outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out. While international organisations like the World Health Organization WHO will regularly boast about ‘eradicating polio’ with vaccines—the opposite seems to be the case, with vaccines causing the deaths of scores of young people living in Africa. Health officials have now admitted that their plan to stop ‘wild’ polio is backfiring, as scores children are being paralyzed by a deadly strain of the pathogen derived from a live vaccine – causing a virulent wave of polio to spread. This latest pharma-induced pandemic started out in the African countries of Chad and Sudan, with the culprit identified as vaccine-derived polio virus type 2. Officials now fear this new dangerous strain could soon ‘jump continents,’ causing further deadly outbreaks around the world. Shocking as it sounds, this Big Pharma debacle is not new. After spending some $16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio, international health bodies have ‘accidentally’ reintroduced the disease to in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also Iran, as the central Asia region was hit by a virulent strain of polio spawned by the a pharmaceutical vaccine. Also, in 2019, the government of Ethiopia ordered the destruction of 57,000 vials of type 2 oral polio vaccine mOPV2 following a similar outbreak of vaccine-induced polio. The same incident has happened in India as well. It’s important to note that the oral polio vaccine is being pushed by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI, a consortium which is supported and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All of this should be cause for concern, especially with western governments and transnational pharmaceutical giants all rushing to roll-out their new Gates-funded experimental coronavirus vaccine for the global population. Currently, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccine is being tested on the African populationthrough GAVI Vaccine Alliance, another organization funded by the Gates Foundation. A large round of human trials is taking place in South Africa, run by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg—another Gates-funded institution. This latest revelation from Africa should prompt journalists and health advocates to ask harder questions about the efficacy and safety of the much-hype COVID ‘miracle’ vaccine. AP News reports… LONDON AP — The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad — a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan — one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea — were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. “There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad,” the U.N. agency said, adding that genetic sequencing confirmed numerous introductions of the virus into Sudan from Chad. WHO said it had found 11 additional vaccine-derived polio cases in Sudan and that the virus had also been identified in environmental samples. There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient. The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water and most often strikes children under 5. In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. Last week, WHO and partners declared that the African continent was free of the wild polio virus, calling it “an incredible and emotional day.” On Monday, WHO warned that the risk of further spread of the vaccine-derived polio across central Africa and the Horn of Africa was “high,” noting the large-scale population movements in the region. More than a dozen African countries are currently battling outbreaks of polio caused by the virus, including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many of the large-scale vaccination campaigns needed to stamp out polio have been disrupted across Africa and elsewhere, leaving millions of children vulnerable to infection. In April, WHO and its partners reluctantly recommended a temporary halt to mass polio immunization campaigns, recognizing the move could lead to a resurgence of the disease. In May, they reported that 46 campaigns to vaccinate children against polio had been suspended in 38 countries, mostly in Africa, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the campaigns have recently been re-started, but health workers need to vaccinate more than 90% of children in their efforts to eradicate the paralytic disease. Health officials had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, a deadline repeatedly pushed back and missed. Wild polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan; both countries also are struggling to contain outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio. * Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

adc0db84,"Duration 0:47 Villaraigosa talks high-speed rail in Fresno During a visit to Fresno on Sept. 20, 2017, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa supports California high-speed rail project. By Chrsitopher Cadelago Fresno  Antonio Villaraigosa, stopping off Wednesday in the Central Valley to survey construction of the state’s oft-debated high speed rail system, accused Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of repeatedly equivocating on the project, criticizing his Democratic rival for governor of being “for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again.”  The former Los Angeles mayor suggested Newsom, the frontrunner in next year’s contest, was revising his positions “when the winds blow in his direction.”  Newsom was an early backer of the rail project, and he campaigned for the $9.95 billion bond measure in 2008. But his opinion soured over route and business plan deviations. Newsom told a Seattle radio program in 2014 that he would use the money for “other, more pressing infrastructure needs.”  Campaigning for governor, he now says he would work to identify more funding, specifically private investment, yet he still worries about the viability of the $64 billion project considered one of the signature infrastructure efforts of Gov. Jerry Brown.  Villaraigosa said Newsom’s shifting rail statements illustrate a broader approach to campaigning. Newsom Recall Watch with Lara Korte  Keep up with Newsom recall news via text, for just $4 a month: Get an inside look at the campaign and what Newsom is doing to fend off challengers.  “When you look at the way he speaks to different audiences and says different things, again and again, I think you have to look at his support with a grain of salt,” he said midway through a tour of rail construction sites in Fresno, accompanied by Dan Richard, the chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Authority.  Newsom’s campaign dismissed the critique, offering that he’s consistently expressed doubts about the project’s ability to attract private dollars, particularly after its route, originally pitched to bond voters as focusing on Los Angeles to San Francisco, was replaced with an initial 32-mile segment under construction between Fresno and Madera counties.  Newsom spokesman Dan Newman said Villaraigosa’s charges are “particularly ludicrous considering the source.”  He ripped Villaraigosa for attending a chamber of commerce political function in Fresno and pointed to his past support for a non-partisan effort, the Campaign to Fix the Debt, which proposed various changes to entitlements like Medicare and Social Security.  “He used to be a Democratic labor organizer, and today he’s literally raising money to support Republicans,” Newman said. “That’s Guinness Book of Records flip floppery.” Capitol Alert newsletter  Get political and Capitol news in your inbox every weekday, plus breaking alerts.

bfd9ddf6,"Rhode Island Congressmen Jim Langevin D-RI and David Cicilline D-RI, who both serve on the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, described a Federal Bureau of Investigation report, released by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, as a call to action. The report illustrated Rhode Island’s failure to submit health records of individuals barred from purchasing handguns to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS. Rhode Island ranked among the lowest-performing states in the country, submitting fewer than 100 mental health records since the inception of the database under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act twenty years ago.  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires an individual to pass a background check through the NICS database before purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, a process that typically takes 90 seconds. Data released last month by the FBI, reflecting record submissions as of May 2013, shows that the NICS remains incomplete, with hundreds of thousands of state and federal records missing. According to the report, the omission of mental health records in the NICS has created dangerous information deficiencies.  “This is an opportunity to educate ourselves on the deficiencies that exist within the NICS and strengthen gun violence prevention efforts in our state. It is critical that we take meaningful action to fill these information gaps and create a more effective background check process,” said Langevin. “I strongly believe that Rhode Island can strengthen its reporting requirements in a manner that respects the balance of privacy and public safety.”  Rhode Island law currently prohibits the disclosure of mental health records without the express permission of the patient or guardian. State lawmakers created a 20-member task force to examine Rhode Island’s participation in the NICS and make recommendations to the General Assembly by January 31.  “As a founding member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, I strongly believe that commonsense measures, like improving the NICS database, are the best methods to strengthen gun violence prevention in Rhode Island and around the country,” said Cicilline. “Congress needs to work with states to increase measures, like background checks, that protect the public from violence, and I am committed to continue working with the delegation to bring federal resources to improve reporting and bridging the information gaps in these requirements here in our state.”  Earlier this year, Langevin and Cicilline announced the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force’s comprehensive policy principles designed to reduce gun violence while respecting Second Amendment Rights of law-abiding Americans. The Congressmen cosponsored the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act HR 1565, a bipartisan bill that brings all commercial firearm sales under the background check system to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from slipping through loopholes that endanger public safety.

As Ann Coulter has pointed out, this is the most critical issue of the 2016 race because this is the issue that will define whether or not there will even be an American nation recognizable as the “home of the free and land of the brave.”  But illegal immigration is not “Ann Coulter’s issue” any more than it is “Tom Tancredo’s issue.” It is America’s issue — not only because it will define America in the 21st Century but because it also defines American elections and who will be voting in elections in 2020 and beyond. It also illuminates the power of the mainstream media to keep issues off the national stage.  Think of illegal immigration this way: If the liberal media can keep illegal alien crime out of the “kitchen table debate,” they can keep any issue out of the debate. And they will if they can get away with it. For those reasons, illegal immigration is much more than an issue of public policy; it is the poster child for media malpractice.  The media’s attempt to suppress public awareness over illegal alien crime and the effects of illegal immigration on American workers’ jobs and wages is nothing less than censorship on a massive scale. We need to start talking about it in those terms and hold the media accountable for the lack of ethical standards.  The mainstream media – including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal — are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco exposed only the tip of a massive iceberg, and the media establishment is desperate to avoid dealing with the iceberg underneath.  Let’s look at a few numbers. You haven’t seen them in the New York Times, Atlanta Constitution, or the Miami Herald, nor have they been featured on NBC Nightly news or CNN. So, the average American is blissfully unaware of them.  Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34% and Arizona 17.8%.  During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states.  That 38% represents 7,085 murders out of the total of 18,643.  That 5.6% figure for the average illegal alien population in those five states comes from US Census estimates. We know the real number is double that official estimate. Yet, even if it is 11%, it is still shameful that the percentage of murders by criminal aliens is more than triple the illegal population in those states.  Those astounding numbers were compiled by the Government Accountability Office GAO using official Department of Justice data on criminal aliens in the nation’s correctional system. The numbers were the basis for a presentation at a recent New Hampshire conference sponsored by the highly respected Center for Security Policy. You can view the full presentation here:  The federal Bureau of Prisons category “criminal aliens” includes legal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, but over 90% of incarcerated criminal aliens are illegal aliens, so it is reasonable to use these numbers as a close approximation of the extent of illegal alien crime.  Similar data is available at the state level if state officials have the desire to look for it. The Texas Department of Public Safety reports that between 2008 and 2014, 35% of the all murder convictions were illegal aliens—averaging 472 murders each year from 2004 to 2008.  Do you know the numbers for your state? Does your congressman, Senator, or Governor know those numbers? Of course not. If you are afraid of the answer, don’t ask the question.  There is widespread public ignorance of illegal alien crime in every state because the mainstream media does investigate such matters. Why? Because they do not want the public to think about such things. The media, from the Associated Press down to the Main Street News, does not even allow the phrase “illegal immigrant” to appear in print.  So, the numbers are out there in the criminal justice system and correctional institutions, waiting to be compiled and published. State attorneys general and state legislators could access the data if they were interested, and so could the media, but they don’t. In fact, in Colorado in 2006, the state legislature passed a law ordering the state Attorney General to compile accurate data on the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and send a bill for reimbursement to the federal government. The state AG sent the feds a bill for only half the real costs — the cost of inmates in the state prison system and not the costs imposed on taxpayers by an equal number of inmates in county jails across the state.  The US Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Programs publishes an annual report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a report that includes data on the number of criminal aliens incarcerated each state prison system and each county jail. It takes some prodigious digging to find the data, but it is there.  But our mainstream media, our self-described guardians of the First Amendment, consciously avoids the effort and declines to put a public spotlight on the problem or demand public scrutiny and public accountability. Why?  The answer is that public debate on the problem of illegal alien crime does not serve the progressive political agenda. The issue is swept under the rug and anyone who raises it is called a racist.  This is media malpractice of historic proportions, and publishers and editors are the unindicted coconspirators in those 7,085 murders.",Illegal Alien Crime Accounts for over 30% of Murders in Many States,FALSE
dc063e58,"A stimulus bill has gone through, but it was a long process due to the depraved obstruction of Nancy Pelosi and the vile Democrats. Their refusal to pass several bills before this showed their indifference to the plight of the American people. Apparently, they just don’t care.  This lack of caring has shocked the nation. Nobody suspected that Pelosi and company would be so callous as to jeopardize American livelihoods during a crisis through partisan politics, yet that’s exactly what happened. People are angry about this, none more so than President Trump himself.  The President is expected to use his powers under the declared State of Emergency to remove Speaker Pelosi from Congress. He will describe her to the court as “a threat to the future safety of the American citizens”, which will allow him to take extraordinary measures to see to her being taken from office. This is an unprecedented move, but a White House insider, who goes by the name of Joe Barron, tells us that Trump feels he has no other choice.  “The President feels that Pelosi’s delay jeopardized the well-being of the people in a time of national emergency. In these times, we must all come together and put our politics aside. The Speaker’s unwillingness to do so makes it clear that she does not have the best interests of the country at heart. It’s felt that her selfishness could cause real harm to the public and to the government’s efforts to eradicate this problem and carry us into the future. He’s getting rid of her.”  At least there is some good coming from this catastrophe. Finally, Pelosi will be gone.

df9949a5,"Bryan Fischer Radio Host MORE  Mask mania has swept the United States, with some surveys admitting that perhaps 95% of Americans are wearing them, under the entirely illusory belief that the masks are doing them some good.  Unfortunately, no scientific study has demonstrated that masks do any good at all in terms of protecting people from COVID-19. Some mask wearers may feel a little better, because they may feel like they have some protection even though in reality they have none.  Governors and mayors, caught up in the mindless frenzy, are imposing fines on constituents who go au naturale. Houston’s mayor will issue $250 fines after a single warning for those caught without a face covering. Miami issues $100 citations for a first and second offense followed by an arrest on the third offense. Broward County fines violators $1000 a day, and continued malfeasance can put someone behind bars for 60 days.  There might be some slight justification for these draconian measures if masks worked. But they don’t.  The N95 masks, about which there was so much frenzy a couple of months ago, filter stuff that comes in but filter nothing going out since they are designed for contaminated environments. So if you’re in Walmart and somebody comes cruising in wearing an N95 mask, you have no protection at all from him. He may think he’s protecting you, but he’s not. You may think he’s protecting you, but he’s not.  Surgical masks also filter incoming air, but since they are designed for sterile environments they quickly become clogged in normal outdoor environments. Consequently, they must be changed or thrown out every 20-30 minutes in a non-sterile environment. And if you happen to come in contact with pathogens, the particles just become trapped in the mask, and the mask becomes little more than a portable virus dispenser. Every time you take one off and put one on you transfer whatever is on the mask to your face. You are breathing in pathogens from everywhere you’ve been.  The cloth masks, homemade or not, are the worst. Cloth masks do not filter anything, going out or coming in. As you breathe out all you are doing is trapping carbon dioxide in your mask, which is the one thing cloth masks are actually good at. So by wearing one, you are endangering your health more than you are protecting it. The moisture from your breath is caught in these masks and can become mildew ridden overnight. You may wind up with mask-induced dry coughing, allergies, and a sore throat from the micro-mold in your mask.  A review of the scientific literature on COVID-19 reveals that simply put, “masks and respirators do not work. There have been extensive randomized controlled trial RCT studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles.”  The reason is that none of the available masks have a mesh that’s fine enough to capture the COVID-19 particles. In fact, the known facts of physics and biology say that masks cannot work. “The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles < 2.5 ?m, which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.” Emphasis mine. In other words, it only takes a dose smaller than one aerosol particle to infect someone, and none of the masks can capture even a single particle that small.  Here’s a sample of the medical literature on the subject:  Jacobs, J. L. et al. 2009 “Face mask use in HCW Health Care Workers was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds” which of course are caused by viruses. Plus, the health care workers were significantly more likely to experience headaches.  Cowling, B. et al. 2010 “ None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask , in either HCW or community members in households therein.  bin-Reza et al. 2012 “There were 17 eligible studies. … None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”  Smith, J.D. et al. 2016 “We identified six clinical studies … . In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of a laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, b influenza-like illness, or c reported work-place absenteeism.”  Offeddu, V. et al. 2017 “Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection VRI was not statistically significant .”  Radonovich, L.J. et al. 2019 “Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”  Long, Y. et al. 2020 “There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks.”  Conclusion: “No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public...All of this to say that: if anything gets through and it always does, irrespective of the mask, then you are going to be infected. Masks cannot possibly work. It is not surprising, therefore, that no bias-free study has ever found a benefit from wearing a mask or respirator in this application.”  It’s long past time for our health officials to start dealing in actual science instead of the pseudo-science they’ve been peddling since the beginning of this self-induced, panic-driven hysteria. They should begin today to broadcast loud and clear that there is no known benefit arising from wearing a mask in a viral respiratory illness epidemic.  The bottom line is quite simple: Masks do not work, cannot work, and never will work.  The author may be contacted at bfischer@afa.net",Masks Do Not Work. Period.,FALSE
6f3c729d,"By Dr. James Stangle, DVM, Milesville, SD  ?The impossible whopper is being advertised by Burger King as a plant based alternative to the whopper. When food manufacturers started talking about making artificial meat, I, too, thought it would be impossible to make a hamburger cheaply enough to make it competitive. You see, I assumed that they would have to buy the individual amino acids the building blocks for protein and chemically string them together in the proper order, then remove the reagents chemicals needed to cause the chain reactions and then add something to give it the right textures.  ?The impossible whopper made by Impossible Foods bypassed all of those steps. Let’s compare the two. The impossible whopper patty is made from 24 ingredients. The most important ingredient is soy protein. The whopper patty has just one ingredient. That would be beef.  ?The impossible whopper has 630 calories, mostly from the added oils. The whopper has 660 calories. So, about 5% less calories, this is not a huge improvement.  The impossible whopper has 25 grams of protein. The whopper has 28 grams. Seems pretty equal, only 11% less protein in the impossible whopper. However, not all proteins are created equal. There are 20 amino acids. Nine of which are essential, meaning your body cannot make them so they are required in the diet. Each of those essential amino acids must meet a certain level to make a complete protein profile. If any essential amino acid does not hit the required amount, it is said to be rate limiting. As an analogy, picture nine chains connected in a line. All of the chains need to lift 100 pounds to carry the load. If one chain can only support 50 pounds, it doesn’t matter how much the others can support. The 50 pound chain is the rate limiting chain.  ?As an extreme example, bovine gelatin, aka Jell-O, is 100% protein; however, it completely lacks the essential amino acid histidine. Therefore, its value as a protein is zero. In beef the rate limiting amino acid is tryptophan, which is at 79% of the required level. In soy protein, the rate limiting amino acid is methionine, which is at 41% of the required level. So, to compare the impossible whopper with the whopper, you have to take 0.41 x 25 grams of protein and compare it to 0.79 x 28 grams of protein. The impossible whopper has 10 grams of usable protein and the whopper has 22 grams of usable protein. So you would have to eat two and a quarter impossible whoppers to get the same protein in one whopper.  ?Now, let’s compare the estrogen hormone in an impossible whopper to the whopper made from hormone implanted beef. The impossible whopper has 44 mg of estrogen and the whopper has 2.5 ng of estrogen. Now let me refresh your metric system. There are 1 million nanograms ng in one milligram mg. That means an impossible whopper has 18 million times as much estrogen as a regular whopper. Just six glasses of soy milk per day has enough estrogen to grow boobs on a male. That’s the equivalent of eating four impossible whoppers per day. You would have to eat 880 pounds of beef from an implanted steer to equal the amount of estrogen in one birth control pill.  There is one ingredient in the impossible whopper that bears mentioning. Beefs red color comes from hemoglobin, the oxygen binding protein in blood, and myoglobin, the molecule that takes the oxygen away from the hemoglobin. To get the same red color in an impossible whopper, they used leghemoglobin. This is the cool part. Leghemoglobin is made by the bacteria, Rhizobium. Rhizobium is the crucial bacterium that lives in the nodules of the roots of legumes like soybeans. Rhizobium has an enzyme that can take nitrogen from the air and turn it into fertilizer, which the plant can use. The bacterial enzyme that binds the nitrogen is damaged by the presence of oxygen so the bacterium makes the leghemoglobin to bind oxygen to keep it out of the way. To make enough leghemoglobin to add to the impossible whopper, scientists spliced the gene for leghemoglobin into yeast. They can grow the yeast easily and separate the leghemoglobin and add it to the impossible whopper. So the impossible whopper is technically a genetically modified organism GMO. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s cool. I’m all in favor of GMO’s. More should be done with them to improve our food supply. Currently, the only GMO protein that is legal in the US is a GMO salmon that is engineered to grow twice as fast. Unfortunately, the production and sale of it in the US is blocked by Senator, Lisa Murkowsky R. Alaska. No doubt to protect Alaska’s salmon industry. Scientists have made a GMO milk cow which is modified to be polled hornless yet neither its meat nor milk is allowed to enter the food supply. What’s funny about the impossible whopper being a GMO is that the people most likely to eat it are the ones most likely to be against GMO’s.  ?So when you watch the next Burger King commercial and you see the guy dressed as a cowboy eating an impossible whopper saying, “Well, I’m a darn fool”. “Just say, yep!” There is another word for really big lie. It is called a whopper. Here’s to hoping that the impossible whopper is a possible flopper.  By Dr. James Stangle, DVM, Milesville, SD",Stangle: Impossible burgers are made of what?,FALSE

Boseman died at his home in the Los Angeles area, his publicist Nicki Fioravante told The Associated Press. Originally, it was thought he had died of cancer. However, during the autopsy, the coroner discovered the actor was actually poisoned, and otherwise healthy.  Chadwick Boseman was poisoned — Kathy Coleman @KJCCOLEMAN August 30, 2020  There is now an active investigation into who administered the poisoning, and are looking into Boseman’s Doctor as a potential suspect. Police are now considering this a homicide, and will be holding a press conference in the next 48 hours.  Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer four years ago, his family said in a statement. However, the actor was able to beat the disease, which makes his sudden death even more suspicious.  Chadwick Boseman lived his purpose with every role. Each story he helped tell was a service to his community. A true culture worker — Ivie Ani @ivieani August 29, 2020  “A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much,” his family said in the statement. “From ‘Marshall’ to ‘Da 5 Bloods,’ August Wilson’s ‘Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom’ and several more – all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honour of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in ‘Black Panther.”’ Unfortunately, it was not the cancer that killed him, it was something else.  Boseman had not spoken publicly about his diagnosis.  Was Chadwick Boseman murdered by Antifa thugs?    Many people are saying he was — Project 1599 @Project_1599 August 29, 2020  Born in South Carolina, Boseman graduated from Howard University and had small roles in television before his first star turn in 2013. His striking portrayal of the stoic baseball star Robinson opposite Harrison Ford in 2013’s “42” drew attention in Hollywood.  Boseman died on a day that Major League Baseball was celebrating Jackie Robinson day.  His T’Challa character was first introduced to the blockbuster Marvel movies in 2016’s “Captain America: Civil War,” and his “Wakanda Forever” salute reverberated around the world after the release of “Black Panther” two years ago.  Chadwick Boseman the actor in black panther was poisoned at the hospital he was being treated at. He represented black strength&power His cancer growth was a BENIGN TUMOR and was told he would return to work before long.

Many of Boseman’s fans have taken to Twitter to make the claim he was poisoned. Ismail Raygal cited the actor’s otherwise good health and plans to return to work.  Some fans have made claims that Boseman was killed by the Illuminati, however, that claim has not been substantiated by any of the sources close to the scene.

Experts looked at data on 22,332 confirmed deaths in England since March 31, when pre-existing conditions began to be reported, and found 5,873 were suffering from diabetes. Dementia was the second most common condition linked with COVID mortality, affecting 18 percent of confirmed cases. But just seven percent of patients who died from the respiratory disease had asthma.  The breakdown comes as coronavirus fatalities in the UK rose to 33,614 after 428 more deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. A total of 233,151 people have now tested positive for the bug across Britain - up 3,446 from yesterday. The death toll refers to those who have died in all settings – including hospitals, care homes, hospices and the community. Around four million Britons are affected by diabetes.  People with the illness have been told they are at higher risk from the pandemic and are being urged to stay indoors as much as possible. Professor Partha Kar, a national speciality advisor for diabetes for the NHS, said: “It is clear that people with diabetes are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 and more detailed analysis is currently underway to understand the link between the two. Initial findings indicate that the threat in people under 40 continues to be very low. “The NHS has put extra measures in place so that people living with diabetes can manage their condition better during the pandemic.  It includes a range of online services, video consultations with your local clinical team and a dedicated helpline for those who need advice.” A separate government survey revealed yesterday that up to 222,000 people in England may be infected with the coronavirus right now. The first round of random tests of 10,000 members of the public has identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 and estimated a national infection level of 0.27 percent – one in every 370 people. This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, with the official estimate ranging from 94,000 to 222,000. During that time 66,343 people were officially diagnosed.  And the rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population, the survey found. While 1.33 percent of people who worked in patient-facing roles in hospitals or homes tested positive for the virus, only 0.22 percent of those with other jobs did so. The numbers did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher.

Scott Walker and Democrat Mary Burke, a former Trek Bicycle executive and state Commerce secretary.  Each week, the newspaper will be putting questions on key issues to Burke and Walker and then publishing their answers on the All Politics Blog, in regular stories and in larger packages that will run closer to the November election.  Here’s the next question and set of answers:  Unions: Would you favor lowering benefit payments or bringing back any bargaining power for public employee unions? Would you favor cutting bargaining for police and firefighters or private-sector workers? Would you favor changing current civil service protections?  Walker: Early in 2010, a teacher in Milwaukee was named the outstanding new English teacher for the entire state. Not long after, she was told she was being laid off. How could this happen? Prior to our Act 10 reforms, most schools had to hire and fire based on seniority and tenure because of union contracts.  Now schools can hire and fire based on merit and pay based on performance. On top of that, schools saved tens of millions of dollars by bidding out health insurance while state and local governments were able to clamp down on overtime abuses to save real money.  In contrast, as a member of the Madison School Board, Mary Burke voted to keep the pre-Act 10 contracts and her first budget vote included a sizable property tax increase. So far, she refuses to answer a simple question: Would she sign a bill to repeal Act 10? I support our Act 10 reforms because they saved the taxpayers some $3 billion.  Burke: I support the right of public employees to collectively bargain and will work to restore that right. This does not stand in the way of having accountable, effective and efficient government. Concessions on health care and pension contributions could have been achieved through collective bargaining. I know from my business experience that ensuring workers feel respected and have a voice is a big part of attracting and retaining a qualified work force.  The following elements of Act 10 were politically-motivated attempts to punish unions and I would work to repeal them – 1 Annual recertification elections requiring approval of 51% of membership, 2 Prohibiting “fair share” arrangements, 3 Prohibiting automatic dues deductions.

Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.”  During President Trump’s four years in office he and what has been referred to as the Alliance have been fighting this Cabal – a Satan worshipping force composed of thirteen Satanist Bloodline families out of Italy, the Vatican, UK Monarchy, British M16, Chinese Communist Party, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and certain Republican and Democratic Lawmakers. Another attempt on his life was the last straw.  Since that Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law with President Trump as Commander in Chief and General Flynn in charge of the Military. As such Trump has signed multiple Executive Orders that among other powers, allowed for Military arrests and Tribunals.  Soon to be acted upon were well over 222,286 sealed indictments against political and global elites filed in federal courts across the nation.  https://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/2021/01/sealed-indictments-as-of-december-31.html#more  By law with the Insurrection Act in effect, Trump would remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies were arrested. He would soon take down the Main Stream Media.  “I’m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and Deep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.”  It’s no small task to take down the Cabal. Military and Special Forces units have been deploying all over the US in 400+ cities. Right now there were over 15,000 troops in DC according to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Special Forces units have covertly infiltrated Antifa and Black Lives Matter and made silent covert arrests.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4_DNABtptU  That same Sat. 9 Jan. POTUS and the Department of Defense postponed the 20 Jan. Presidential Inauguration. Intel sources claimed that if Joe Biden was not inaugurated there were corrupt-FBI plans to help stage Antifa and BLM violence in DC and at the 50 state capitols from Sat 16 Jan. through Wed. 20 Jan. Biden couldn’t be inaugurated anyway because of the Insurrection Act that demanded Trump remain in office “until all domestic enemies were arrested.”  A corrupt Mass Media has refused to report anything but their Left Wing agenda believed paid for by the CCP. Thus, the President has announced he would soon activate the Emergency Broadcast System EBS. This was expected during what has been referred to as Ten Days of Darkness, or media outage.  With the EBS everyone would get alerts on their phones, TV, radio and Internet that would override other broadcasts for several hours at a time. The broadcasts would explain the silent war happening across the globe between the Cabal and Alliance.  This week Trump Intel providers Robert David Steele and Juan OSavin explained, “This may not be settled until April 1. Anyone including Fox, who refuses to broadcast the President of the US faces loss of their FCC licenses as well as criminal punitive actions, perhaps a military takeover.”  On Wed. 13 Jan. in an urgent message to the American people President Trump called for peace. Intel sources were reporting that riots were planned in DC and across the nation. He condemned the rioters at the state capitol, as well as a recent assault by Social Media on our Freedom of Speech and then activated military forces to quell unrest.  https://trendingpolitics.com/breaking-president-trump-releases-urgent-video-message-to-the-american-people/  The recent violation of Social Media platforms to censor Freedom of Speech was of concern. Donald Trump Jr. to the rescue. Trump Jr. announced that a new social media platform was coming soon called the Freedom Social Network.  More important, President Trump had officially shut down the Cabal’s USA Inc. and re-started a restored Republic on 4 July 2020.  https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183531/http://reality-bytes.hubpages.com/hub/The-Corporation-Of-The-United-States-Of-America  It was all a part of the Alliance’s Plan to free the globe of the Communist Parties /Cabal’s suppression of The People. “The Plan To Save The World”:  https://rumble.com/vagd07-q-the-plan-to-save-the-world-remastered.html  https://www.bitchute.com/video/qvfUkQTG5QHP/  As part of that plan President Trump’s Space Force has been involved in worldwide blackouts in multiple countries as Alliance Special Force units made arrests. Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election.  Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism.  By Tues. 12 Jan. the White House had launched the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.  During this coming weekend to 20 Jan. there may be food and supply shortages, on-off outages of communication, media and social media, plus ATM and credit card transaction disruptions. You were advised to be prepared.

The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output, instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.  “ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits,” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”  Moreover, the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,” an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.  On Wednesday, the Dallas Business Journal reported, “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1,137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February, up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020, according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas.

He was well-liked by all those in the Hollywood community and his movies were always well received by the public, even the really crappy ones like “Castaway.” His body of work will live on for decades to come.  For the past several years, Hanks had been been very vocal with his opposition to President Trump. He often called the president names, none of which can be printed here, and when he did so, he made sure that his comments were broadcast far and wide for the public to hear. His deep hatred for President Trump has been very well known.  Of course, we all know why he said those things about Trump. Hanks was known to be a frequent visitor to Epstein Island and so he knew that the president was coming for him. His using all that energy on discrediting Trump’s every move was clearly an attempt to have him removed from office which would then allow him to stay free from prison.  While on his deathbed , however, Hanks must have realized that there was no point in carrying on the ruse any longer. According to his wife, Tom made a deathbed confession, the likes of which no one would have ever expected.  In it, he confessed his love for President Trump and all his accomplishments to date. He went so far as to say that the president was “really really great“ and that Trump “was the best possible choice for America. He’s done stellar work so far.”  His wife, Rita, was impressed by his honesty at the end but said that she wished he had told her all that years ago so that she could have “dumped his trumpy ass.”  The world has lost an iconic acting legend, but that’s not all.

27838a55,"By Wayne LaPierre  Before I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts, let’s acknowledge that all over this country, tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes.  These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves.  It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people.  During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing. Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States. Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S./Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last.  The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border. So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U.S., but to criminals whose jobs are murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Ominously, the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U.S. border as their path of entry into the country.  When the next terrorist attack comes, the Obama administration won’t accept responsibility. Instead, it will do what it does every time: blame a scapegoat and count on Obama’s “mainstream” media enablers to go along.  A heinous act of mass murder—either by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long ago—will be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control.  No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever.  After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all.  Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!  Meanwhile, President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin, borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony “stimulus” spending and other payoffs for his political cronies. Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come, but if the country is broke, there likely won’t be enough money to pay for police protection. And the American people know it.  Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It’s not paranoia to buy a gun. It’s survival. It’s responsible behavior, and it’s time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that.  Since the election, millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores, Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it. They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy, own and use firearms. Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms. That’s one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight.  Inevitably, the anti-gun media and the gun-ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms. They call us “extremists” because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi-auto in three years or, even in some states, later this year. That’s despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all!  The media try to make rank-and-file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun. The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers. But we know the truth. We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America.  Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed. We, the American people, clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face: terrorists, crime, drug gangs, the possibility of Euro-style debt riots, civil unrest or natural disaster.  Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn’t there—or simply doesn’t show up in time.  To preserve the inalienable, individual human right to keep and bear arms—to withstand the siege that is coming—the NRA is building a four-year communications and resistance movement. The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance, commitment and determination. We will Stand And Fight.  First, we are going to devise legal capability like never before. I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti-gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. But he probably will, and we must meet that challenge. His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro-rights justices in the 5-4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high. And there’s no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts.  That means the federal courts are going to get worse and worse. So some cases, on which we might have improved our chances of victory by waiting a while, are going to have to be brought now.  Besides bringing affirmative pro-rights cases, we will also have to litigate against the flood of new anti-gun federal regulations that are coming, and against anti-gun laws that are going to be enacted in some of the states.  Second, we must strengthen the NRA like never before. We are, and always have been, a genuine grassroots organization. And never has your membership been more important. Never has the nra been more in need of your support.  The national media, with its slanted and inaccurate “news” coverage of the gun issue, has given the gun-ban groups the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising.  Now, the threat is even greater. Michael Bloomberg and George Soros are each, individually, far wealthier than the entire National Rifle Association. When the NRA spends money on political advertising, we have to raise those funds from you—$20, $50, $250, or $1,000 at a time. In the last election, Bloomberg alone spent $16 million and that doesn’t even count the indirect spending by groups funded by Soros and his fellow billionaires.  The hard truth is that due to Bloomberg, Soros, and the rest of their ilk, the dangers require that we increase our presence all across the country—in Congress, the state capitols, and in your city and towns.  As we Stand And Fight, the third, and most important, part of our action plan demands that we organize like never before. That’s the most important part of all.  Every gun owner should be an active member of the NRA. Every gun owner should be sure that every member of his or her family is an active member.  For most of the last hundred years, a strong NRA has been the indispensable shield against the destruction of our nation’s Second Amendment rights. Now, an even stronger nra is the only chance gun owners have to withstand the coming siege.  This begins with remembering to keep your own membership active, or reactivate it if it has lapsed. It means reminding yourself, “I have a son and daughter who aren’t members and should be.” It means reaching out to your hunting and shooting friends and personally telling them why it’s so important that they join the NRA now, during this time of peril.  The NRA is launching a nationwide, full-court initiative to urge every gun owner, and every non-gun-owning lover of freedom, to join the NRA and fight this battle. I will personally be traveling all over America enlisting new members.  We must reach out to the tens of millions of gun owners who are not yet NRA members—to the gun owners who care about their own rights but who have been duped by Obama and the national media into believing that the Obama and Bloomberg gun controls will only affect other people. They are naively sitting on the sidelines, imagining themselves immune from the coming siege.  Yet no matter how much I travel, I can’t be everywhere. NRA members, though, can be everywhere. We already are. The 4 million of us belong to every community in the United States. We are the largest civil rights organization in the world, and we have been part of the fabric of America ever since 1871. So it is you, proud NRA members, who are the key to enlisting new members in the ranks of our army of freedom.  NRA grassroots has always been our Association’s greatest strength. To compete with Bloomberg and his gang, it must be much stronger still. Historically, we have always been able to rely on volunteers, and I’m going to ask you and need you to answer the call to help throughout the next four years.  Every year, shooting is becoming more and more popular, with more people engaging in the shooting sports for fun. More people are buying guns and trying new disciplines, such as 3-gun competitions, sporting clays, practical shooting and so on.  As we Stand And Fight, let’s continue to make the shooting sports one of the fastest-growing recreational activities in America. By doing so, and by telling others about it, we’ll popularize and make gun owning and shooting more mainstream than ever before. That will be even more effective if we remember to invite new people to participate and provide them with the responsible mentorship and guidance that the NRA has exemplified for over 140 years.  We can’t win the political war if we lose the cultural war. One of the great protectors of the Second Amendment is the popular, active, responsible use of firearms for shooting and hunting.  We don’t want America to become like England, where some of that nation’s outstanding rifle competitors keep their hobby a dark secret from their neighbors for fear of social disapproval. We’re not going to let the anti-gunners push us into that zone. As I remind people every day, we are the majority.  We have so much to be proud of as gun owners, shooters and freedom lovers. That pride, especially when it’s not hidden in the closet, is itself a form of protection for the Second Amendment.  We will not surrender. We will not appease. We will buy more guns than ever. We will use them for sport and lawful self-defense more than ever. We will grow the NRA more than ever. And we will be prouder than ever to be freedom-loving NRA patriots. And with your help, we will ensure that the Second Amendment remains America’s First Freedom.  We will Stand And Fight.",Stand and Fight,partially false
8817ebf3,"With merchants in Democrat-run cities boarding up their storefront windows, the possibility of serious urban violence is well understood. As horrific as that could get ask anyone who lives in Minneapolis, the progressive fascists appear to have a plan in place to make it even worse: disguising their rioters as Trump-supporters in order to make the case that Donald Trump truly is a dictator that must be violently overthrown if he wins or arrested and prosecuted if he loses. A source that has always been reliable was able to photograph an Antifa flyer: What makes all of this particularly chilling is that progressives already are absurdly claiming that the threat of violence comes from our side. Portland's Mayor Ted Wheeler warns of white racist rioters inspired by the rhetoric from Washington, D.C. i.e., Trump: Given the heightened concerns about potential violence, particularly from white supremist organizations and the divisive rhetoric from Washington, D.C., the need for coordination and partnership takes on statewide significance. Oregon is likely to be a flashpoint. — Mayor Ted Wheeler @tedwheeler November 2, 2020 Other media players, such Vox and the New York Times, warn of both sides, a disguise of balance but ridiculously unrealistic, considering the utter lack of property destruction by the right and massive destruction at the hands of the left since Gorge Floyd's death in police custody. Tucker Carlson and Lisa Boothe last night addressed Ted Wheeler's warning and correctly pointed out its absurdity. As they noted, if merchants believed that white supremacists were the threat, they would not be spray-painting We support Black Lives Matter on their plywood window coverings.

6130328a,"After the Korean Medical Association had called on Seoul to stop the flu vaccination program for a review, South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun finally called for an investigation for the safety issues. This is because the death toll in South Korea after getting flu vaccines has rose to 97; as reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency KDCA last week. The KDCA, however, still denies that there is a connection between these seemingly genocidal phenomena and the vaccines being used in the government’s free flu shot program. What’s more disturbing is that the KCDA still urges the SK citizens to continue getting vaccination despite the growing number of dead flu vaccine recipients. To some, this is not surprising for an institution like the KCDA. Such organizations claiming to be in charge of diseases control and prevention, while ironically tainted with conflicts of interest, have been proven to be untrustworthy and deceiving when it comes to science many times in history. For example, a report from Children’s Health Defence CHD website stated the following: “The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends that everyone aged six months and up, including pregnant women, get an annual flu shot to protect against the influenza virus. The mainstream media characterize this recommendation as being firmly grounded in science. The demonstrable truth of the matter, however, is that what the government and media say science says and what science actually tells us are two completely different things.” What’s more diabolical is that they even recommend this flu vaccine to pregnant women! On the same report, the CHD website also wrote: “The CDC’s recommendation that pregnant women get the flu shot is all the more disturbing given the fact that multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine contain the preservative Thimerosal, which is half ethylmercury by weight. Ethylmercury is a known neurotoxin that can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. It can also cross the placental barrier and enter the brain of the developing fetus.” Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the flu vaccine being used to the SK citizens has contributed or probably the main cause of death. Even if the manufacturers and the state health departments often deny it, common sense would tell us that substances containing heavy metals such as mercury and aluminium, not to mention dozens of other questionable and alarming agents in the vaccine, are very detrimental and should not be put in a human’s body. For instance, during the last year’s United Nation UN summit regarding vaccination, doctors and other experts admitted that there has been no proof that vaccines are safe and effective. In a report published in the naturalnews.com, Dr. Stephen Evans, a Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology stated in the video: “It seems to me that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to, and that is their intention. It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity vaccine adverse reactions and side effects in many instances, and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen…” Despite the claims by the proponents of vaccines, a peer-reviewed study reveals that unvaccinated people are most protected against influenza flu. In one of its numerous reports about flu vaccines, globalresearch.ca wrote: “At least six separate studies conducted by the same people that are still pushing the flu shot have confirmed that seasonal flu shots make people more prone to contracting the flu. The evidence is now overwhelming that, rather than impart immunity as long claimed, flu shots actually destroy the immune system and increase the risk of infection.” References: Featured image: https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/deaths-rattle-south-korea-s-seasonal-flu-vaccination-but-authority-presses-ahead-free",Flu Vaccine Deaths in South Korea risen to nearly 100; Prime Minister asks for Investigation,partially false
350ee2a0,"The National Pulse can reveal the Black Lives Matter website – the organization spearheading nationwide “defund the police” campaigns – is partnered with ActBlue, a Democrat fundraising platform that is the top donor to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, responsible for raising nearly 99.64 percent of the Biden for President effort.  While the Biden campaign insists it doesn’t support efforts to defund the police, it may happily profit from Black Lives Matter BLM efforts, and is complicit in taking money from an organization partnered with those spearheading the dangerous policy that has already taken root in Minneapolis, New York, and Los Angeles.  After reaching the BLM homepage, which features a “Defund The Police” petition front and center, if a user chooses to donate, they’re rerouted to a site hosted by ActBlue and prompted with the message: “We appreciate your support of the movement and our ongoing fight to end state-sanctioned violence, liberate Black people, and end white supremacy forever.”  The page notes: “By proceeding with this transaction, you agree to ActBlue’s terms & conditions”and includes a banner “ActBlue Charities is a qualified 501c3 tax-exempt organization and donations are tax-deductible to the full extent allowed under the law” at the bottom of the page.

ca8931d3,"“No Deal” Brexit is the only Brexit worth having – because it’s the only Brexit for which people actually voted.  How stupid do you have to be not to realise this?  Sure, for months and months we’ve been deluged with Remainer propaganda in the largely pro-Remain media claiming there’ll be chaos and economic disaster if Britain “crashes out” of the European Union on World Trade Organisation WTO terms.  But most of us know that this is just Project Fear 2.0 spin designed to obscure the fact the most of the world trades with the EU on WTO terms. Do Singapore, India, Hong Kong and the U.S. really look like they are suffering as a result?  So what on earth provoked one of the UK media’s staunchest Brexiteers Rod Liddle to write this abject surrender monkey drivel in today’s Sun?  Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan — a dog’s dinner if ever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all. But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit. And waiting in the wings if the Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party. Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want. But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise. The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority. And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were divided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers. So if this isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.  This is so wrong, so disingenuous, so factually inaccurate from Britain’s best-paid journalist whose stock in trade is – usually – his fearless honesty.

d8bc460f,"We’ve reported on numerous events identified in the 2020 election already which are being referred to as ‘glitches’ by the Democrats. Tonight we just uncovered another ‘glitch’ in Wisconsin.  When this one is confirmed it will result in a 19,500 vote gain for Trump making the Wisconsin race a total toss-up.  There is now a pattern of events we have uncovered across the country where votes are being taken from Republicans at all levels and transferred to competing Democrats in offsetting amounts. These are not random because in every case votes are moved from Republicans to Democrats.  This is beginning to appear like a strategy used by the Democrats to steal this election.    TRENDING: HUGE EXCLUSIVE: Michigan AG Dana Nessel Sends Cease and Desist Order to Journalist Demanding He Erase His #DetroitLeaks Video Showing Voter Fraud Training -- OR FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION  We reported first on a system glitch, as it was labeled, in Michigan which switched 6,000 votes back to President Trump.  Then another example was uncovered in Oakland County Michigan where again a Republican won his race as a result this glitch being reversed.  Then in Pennsylvania a ‘glitch’ was uncovered where nearly 20,000 votes were moved from President Trump to Biden.  When this is confirmed it will result Biden’s lead being cut by 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania bringing this race back to even:  Then we found approximately 6,000 votes which were taken from Trump and moved to Biden in Georgia due to a ‘glitch’:  Now tonight we have identified approximately 10,000 votes that were moved from President Trump to Biden in just one Wisconsin County.  This information came from an individual who saw this happen in Rock County Wisconsin.  On election night the results of the county were presented during the evening and showed that President Trump won Wisconsin in 2016. At 10:59 the votes came in and the race was close with both candidates at around 29,000 ballots. Then by 11:12 President Trump had taken a nearly 1,000 vote lead on Biden with 31,000 votes to Biden’s 30,000:  In  At 11:21 these results had not changed much. Then at 11:43 more votes came in and they showed Trump had taken a commanding lead at 46,649 to Biden’s 37,133. This was a 9,516 vote lead for Trump.  But then suddenly at 11:57 these votes had swapped. Biden was reported with 46,649 and Trump was reduced to Biden’s former total of 37,133. These votes had swapped from the President Trump to Biden – again a swap from a Republican to a Democrat.  The net impact was 19,032 votes.  We checked these numbers again tonight from a different source and the final numbers are still showing Biden ahead of President Trump by the same 9,516 votes.  Currently the race in Wisconsin is showing Biden with a lead of 1,630,570 votes to President Trump’s 1,610,030 votes. When this adjustment is confirmed Biden will only hold a 1,508 vote lead.  This of course is before any of the hundreds of thousands of questionable votes showing up for Biden in Milwaukee early in the morning after the election are validated.  Maybe it is time to classify these ‘glitches’ that go only one way – in the Democrats favor – as a Strategy to steal the election, not a ‘glitch’.  This is now a countrywide issue.

ea538d9a,"Equally troubling was the more recent discovery by Tom Fitz, a geology professor at Northland College in Ashland, Wis., of a highly carcinogenic asbestos-form mineral at one of GTac’s sampling sites. The fibers of the mineral, which would be dispersed in blasting, are like tiny, breathable needles.  Last September, several hundred people gathered outside John F. Kennedy Memorial Airport in Ashland, a few miles from GTac’s mining site, to commemorate Kennedy’s 1963 speech, which called for legislation to protect the area’s natural resources and promoted its economic potential as a scenic region for recreation. One of the last to speak at the event was Mike Wiggins Jr., the chairman of the Bad River tribe and the mine’s most formidable opponent.  The Bad River fear the contamination of the fish they depend on for food and the destruction of sensitive wild rice beds that they harvest on the coast of Lake Superior. Mr. Wiggins has voiced his opposition to the mining legislation in private meetings with Mr. Walker, led Wisconsin’s tribes in demonstrations at the State Capitol in Madison and allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the Bad River tribe’s scant resources to legal fees to fight the mine.  The Bad River and several other tribes assert that the state has no right to permit the enormous mine without their agreement since the site lies in “ceded territory,” an area covering a large portion of Northern Wisconsin where tribal members maintain special hunting, fishing and harvesting rights enshrined in federal treaties. Last June, one of the tribes established an educational camp near the mining site to draw attention to how the mine would violate its treaty rights, as well as to highlight sustainable alternatives to mining. GTac responded to a minor altercation with protesters unconnected to the camp by hiring an Arizona-based private-security firm, which sent guards armed with semiautomatic weapons to patrol the mine site. The guards have since been withdrawn; the camp is still there.  In the Chippewa tradition, a decision is made based on how it will affect people seven generations forward. By contrast, the company’s optimistic estimate for the life span of the first phase of the mine is 35 years. Last summer Mr. Wiggins played Governor Walker a recording of Kennedy’s speech. Mr. Wiggins said that the governor appeared indifferent to Kennedy’s words; Mr. Walker has never wavered in his support of the mine.  Though GTac has already begun bulk sampling iron ore at the site, the mine still faces many hurdles before it can be permitted. The company has filed incomplete sampling applications with the state’s Department of Natural Resources. GTac’s president, Bill Williams, is facing a criminal inquiry in Spain for alleged environmental crimes, which are unrelated to the GTac mine. The charges state that runoff from an open-pit mine where he once worked as an executive contaminated local groundwater. Mr. Williams denies the charges and declined to comment on them. Most important, the tribes will almost certainly challenge the mine in federal court.  Mr. Wiggins and five other tribal leaders have already begun seeking redress from the federal government. Last August, they sent President Obama a letter asking him to direct the Interior Department to prevent the construction of GTac’s mine, citing their claims that the mine would infringe on their treaty rights.  Though the letter did not mention it, five years ago Mr. Obama told nearly 400 Native American tribal leaders, “We have a lot to learn from your nations in order to create the kind of sustainability in our environment that we so desperately need.” The president said that the tribes “deserve to have a voice” and “will not be forgotten as long as I’m in this White House.” Last week, Mr. Wiggins said that although he has gotten preliminary responses from two federal agencies, he is still awaiting an answer from the president.",The Fight for Wisconsin’s Soul - The New York Times,partially false
28afa379,"By Malcolm Kendrick , doctor and author who works as a GP in the National Health Service in England. His blog can be read here and his book, 'Doctoring Data – How to Sort Out Medical Advice from Medical Nonsense,' is available here .  In February, US Covid guru Anthony Fauci predicted the virus was ‘akin to a severe flu’ and would therefore kill around 0.1 percent of people. Then fatality rate predictions were somehow mixed up to make it look ten times WORSE.  When you strip everything else out, the reason for lockdown comes from a single figure: one percent. This was the prediction that Covid, if left unchecked, would kill around one percent of us.  You may not think that percentage is enormous, but one percent of the population of the world is 70 million people – and that’s a lot. It would mean 3.2 million Americans dead, and 670,000 Britons.  But where did this one percent figure come from? You may find this hard to believe, but this figure emerged by mistake. A pretty major thing to make a mistake about, but that’s what happened.  Also on rt.com Up to 90% who test positive for Covid barely carry any virus & aren't contagious, making it hard to grasp true scale of virus  Such things occur. On September 23, 1998, NASA permanently lost contact with the Mars Climate Orbiter. It was supposed to go round and round the planet looking at the weather, but instead it hit Mars at around 5,000 mph, exploding into tiny fragments. It didn’t measure the weather; it became the weather – for a few seconds anyway.  An investigation later found that the disaster happened because engineers had used the wrong units. They didn’t convert pound seconds into Newton seconds when doing their calculations. Imperial, not metric. This, remember, was NASA. An organisation not completely full of numbskulls.  Now you and I probably have no idea of the difference between a pound second and a Newton second it’s 0.67 – I looked it up. But you would kind-of hope NASA would. In fact, I am sure they do, but they didn’t notice, so the figures came out wrong. The initial mistake was made, and was baked into the figures.  Kaboom!  With Covid, a similar mistake happened. One type of fatality rate was substituted for another. The wrong rate was then used to predict the likely death rate – and, as with NASA, no-one picked up the error.  In order to understand what happened, you have to understand the difference between two medical terms that sound the same – but are completely different. Rather like a pound second or a Newton second.  Which fatality rate, did you say?  First, there’s the Infection Fatality Rate IFR. This is the total number of people who are infected by a disease and the number of them who die. This figure includes those who have no symptoms at all, or only very mild symptoms – those who stayed at home, coughed a bit and watched Outbreak.  Then there’s the Case Fatality Rate CFR. This is the number of people suffering serious symptoms, who are probably ill enough to be in hospital. Clearly, people who are seriously ill – the “cases” – are going to have a higher mortality rate than those who are infected, many of whom don’t have symptoms. Put simply – all cases are infections, but not all infections are cases.  Which means that the CFR will always be far higher than the IFR. With influenza, the CFR is around ten times as high as the IFR. Covid seems to have a similar proportion.  Now, clearly, you do not want to get these figures mixed up. By doing so you would either wildly overestimate, or wildly underestimate, the impact of Covid. But mix these figures up, they did.  The error started in America, but didn’t end there. In healthcare, the US is very much the dog that wags the tail. The figures they come up with are used globally.  On February 28, 2020, an editorial was released by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the editorial stated: “… the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza.”  Also on rt.com ‘Corona World’ game backed by German public TV dehumanizes lockdown resisters & kids – but sure, what could go wrong?  They added that influenza has a CFR of approximately 0.1 percent. One person in a thousand who gets it badly, dies.  But that quoted CFR for influenza was ten times too low – they meant to say the IFR, the Infection Fatality Rate, for influenza was 0.1 percent. This was their fatal – quite literally – mistake.  The mistake was compounded. On March 11, the same experts testified to Congress, stating that Covid’s CFR was likely to be about one percent, so one person dying from a hundred who fell seriously ill. Which, as time has passed, has proved to be pretty accurate.  At this meeting, they compared the likely impact of Covid to flu. But they used the wrong CFR for influenza, the one stated in the previous NEJM editorial. 0.1 percent, or one in a thousand. The one that was ten times too low.  Flu toll 1,000 – Covid toll 10,000  So, they matched up the one percent CFR of Covid with the incorrect 0.1 percent CFR of flu. Suddenly, Covid was going to be ten times as deadly.  If influenza killed 50, Covid was going to kill 500. If influenza killed a million, Covid was going to get 10 million. No wonder Congress, then the world, panicked. Because they were told Covid was going to be ten times worse than influenza. They could see three million deaths in the US alone, and 70 million around the world.  I don’t expect you or I to get this sort of thing right. But I bloody well expect the experts to do so. They didn’t. They got their IFR and CFR mixed up and multiplied the likely impact of Covid by a factor of ten.  Here’s what the paper, “Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation”,says: “On March 11, 2020,... based on the data available at the time, Congress was informed that the estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus was ten-times higher than for seasonal influenza, which helped launch a campaign of social distancing, organizational and business lockdowns, and shelter-in-place orders.”  On February 28 it was estimated that Covid was going to have about the same impact as a bad influenza season – almost certainly correct. Eleven days later, the same group of experts predicted that the mortality rate was going to be ten times as high. This was horribly, catastrophically, running-into-Mars-at-5,000-miles-an-hour wrong.  Enter the Mad Modellers of Lockdown  In the UK, the group I call the Mad Modellers of lockdown, the Imperial College experts, created the same panic. On March 16, they used an estimated IFR of 0.9 percent to predict that, without lockdown, Covid would kill around 500,000 in the UK.  Is this prediction anywhere close?  So far, the UK has had around 40,000 Covid deaths. Significantly less than 0.1 percent, but not that far off. Of course, people will say... “We had lockdown... without it so many more would have died. Most people have not been infected…” etc.  To answer this, we need to know the true IFR. Is it a 0.1 percent, or one percent? If it is one percent, we have more than 400,000 deaths to go. If it is 0.1 percent, this epidemic has run its course. For this year, at least.  With swine flu, remember that the IFR started at around two percent. In the end, it was 0.02 percent, which was five times lower than the lowest estimate during the outbreak. The more you test, the lower the IFR will fall.  Also on rt.com We might have to wait forever for science to show the Covid threat is over, so let’s use our common sense & get back to normal  So where can we look to get the current figures on the IFR? The best place to look is at the country that has tested more people than anywhere else as a proportion of their population: Iceland.  As of last week, Iceland’s IFR stood at 0.16 per cent. It cannot go up from here. It can only fall. People can’t start dying of a disease they haven’t got.  This means that we’ll probably end up with an IFR of about 0.1 percent, maybe less. Not the 0.02 percent of Swine Flu – somewhere between the two, perhaps. In short, the 0.1 percent prophecy has proved to be pretty much bang on.  Which means that we’ve had all the deaths we were ever going to get. And which also means that lockdown achieved, almost precisely nothing with regard to Covid. No deaths were prevented.  Mangled beyond recognition  Yes, we are testing and testing, and finding more so-called cases. As you will. But the hospitals and ICUs are virtually empty. Almost no-one is dying of Covid anymore, and most of those who do were otherwise very ill.  Instead of celebrating that, we’ve artificially created a whole new thing to scare ourselves with. We now call a positive test a Covid “case.” This is not medicine. A “case” is someone who has symptoms. A case is not someone carrying tiny amounts of virus in their nose.  Now, however, you test positive, and you’re a “case.” Never in history has medical terminology been so badly mangled. Never have statistics been so badly mangled.  When researchers look back at this pandemic, they’ll have absolutely no idea who died because of Covid, or who died –coincidentally– with it. Everything’s been mashed together in a determined effort to make the virus look as deadly as possible.  Lockdown happened because we were told that Coivid could kill one percent. But Covid was never going to kill more than about 0.1 percent – max.  That’s the figure estimated back in February, by the major players in viral epidemiology. A figure that has turned out to be remarkably accurate. Bright guys… bad mistake.  We’ve killed tens of thousands – for nothing  But because we panicked, we’ve added hugely to the toll. Excess mortality between March and May was around 70,000, not the 40,000 who died of/with Covid. Which means 30,000 may have died directly as a result of the actions we took.  We protected the young, the children, who are at zero risk of Covid. But we threw our elderly and vulnerable under a bus. The very group who should have been shielded. Instead, we caused 20,000 excess deaths in care homes.  It was government policy to clear out hospitals, and stuff care homes with patients carrying Covid, or discharge them back to their own homes, to infect their nearest and dearest. Or any community care staff who visited them.  We threw – to use health secretary Matt Hancock’s ridiculous phrase – a ring of steel around care homes. As it turned out, this was not to protect them, but to trap the residents, as we turned their buildings into Covid incubators. Anyone working in care homes, as I do, knows why we got 20,000 excess deaths. Government policy did this.  That is far from all the damage. On top of care homes, the ONS estimates that 16,000 excess deaths were caused by lockdown. The heart attacks and strokes that were not treated. The empty, echoing hospitals and A&E units. The cancer treatments stopped entirely.  Which means that at least as many people have died as a result of the draconian actions taken to combat Covid, as have been killed by the virus itself. This has been a slow-motion stampede, where the elderly – in particular - were trampled to death.  We locked down in fear. We killed tens of thousands unnecessarily, in fear. We crippled the economy, and left millions in fear of their livelihoods. We have trapped abused women and children at home with their abusers. We have wiped out scores of companies, and crushed entire industries.  We stripped out the NHS, and left millions in prolonged pain and suffering, on ever lengthening waiting lists, which have doubled. There have also been tens of thousands of delayed cancer diagnoses – the effects of which are yet to be seen, but the Lancet has estimated at least sixty thousand years of life will be lost.  Lockdown can be seen as a complete and utter disaster. And it was all based on a nonsense, a claim that Covid was going to kill one percent. A claim that can now be seen to be utterly and completely wrong. Sweden, which did not lock down, has had a death rate of 0.0058 percent.  It takes a very big person to admit they have made a horrible, terrible mistake. But a horrible, terrible mistake has been made. Let’s end this ridiculous nonsense now. And vow never to let such monumental stupidity happen ever again.

b100f125,"Cash-strapped schools are spending a record £1.3bn on supply staff as a result of a chronic shortage of teachers in the nation’s classrooms caused by the failure of the government’s recruitment policies, according to Labour.  At a time when schools are struggling with diminishing budgets and rising costs, the Labour party says spending on supply teachers has gone up by more than a quarter over two years as headteachers struggle to plug staffing gaps.  Labour analysis of new official government figures published last week shows spending on supply teachers – who are called in to cover in the absence of a member of staff – has gone up by almost £300m over two years, with the average amount spent by academies and free schools rising by 42% in a single year.  The figures come days after the scale of the teacher recruitment crisis was laid bare for MPs on the education select committee, who heard that schools were being forced to spend vast sums of money on recruitment agencies to help them fill vacancies.  Where schools would once have placed advertisements in the trade press, which would normally have attracted a selection of strong candidates, headteachers are spending up to £10,000 on agency fees to fill a single vacancy. Others are making expensive trips abroad to recruit.  Lucy Powell, the shadow education secretary, blamed the government’s failure to recruit enough trainee teachers, saying ministers had missed their target for teacher recruitment for the fourth year running.  “With chronic shortages of teachers in our schools, this government is risking the education of the next generation. Ministers have mishandled teacher training, putting applicants off and constantly talked down the profession, causing thousands of teachers to quit.    “As a result, half of all schools had unfilled positions at the start of this year and are being forced to turn to unqualified staff, temporary supply teachers, non-specialists and larger class sizes to try to plug the gaps.  “Nothing is more important for raising standards and improving social mobility than ensuring there are excellent teachers in every school. The government urgently needs to get a grip on this problem, which is affecting the education of our children, and start to take it seriously.”  A Conservative party spokesman accused Labour of scaremongering. “Lucy Powell has not had one positive thing to say about England’s schools and teaching profession since she became shadow education secretary,” the spokesman said.  “Despite many opportunities to laud the achievements of teachers and schools across England, which has seen 1.4 million more pupils in good or outstanding schools since 2010, Labour continue to scaremonger. Rather than recognise that the number and quality of teachers in our schools is at a record high, they talk down the teaching profession.”  Labour says the crisis is being worsened by record numbers of teachers leaving the profession, with 50,000 quitting this year alone – more than those who joined – and worse may be to come. A recent YouGov survey suggested that more than half of teachers 53% are considering giving up in the next two years. The main reasons given were “volume of workload” 61% and “seeking a better work/life balance” 57%.  However, the government claims that the number and quality of teachers is at a record high, with 1,000 more graduates training to teach in secondary schools than a year ago, and the number of former teachers returning to the classroom up from fewer than 15,000 in 2011 to more than 17,000 in 2014. Spending on supply teachers is up, the government says, because of rising pupil numbers.  A spokesperson for the Department for Education DfE said: “It is completely misleading to suggest there are chronic shortages of teachers or that a record number of teachers have ‘quit’ the profession – our increased spending on supply teachers simply reflects our increased total spending in response to rising pupil numbers.  “The overall teacher vacancy rate is 0.3% and has remained under 1% for the past 15 years. The 49,120 that left the profession between November 2013 and November 2014 includes those that left through death or retirement.”  Responding to the Labour figures, Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the research echoed the NAHT recruitment survey, published last week, which showed that almost eight out of 10 school leaders are finding recruitment a problem.  “Supply teachers play a crucial role in addressing short-term gaps in teacher numbers, but an increasing number of school leaders are having to rely on them more frequently and for longer periods than in the past. These figures show an underlying problem in recruitment and retention that the government needs to address.”  There is a recognition from the government and those in the profession that as the economy picks up, competition to recruit graduates will increase. The government is offering bursaries and scholarships worth up to £30,000 tax-free, but many in the profession fear that the workload combined with pay and conditions make teaching unattractive.    The DfE spokesperson said supply teachers perform an important and valuable role. “Schools are best placed to make staffing decisions to reflect their individual needs. It is up to headteachers and governors to decide who is required for the job and this includes how best to cover absences.”  Of the just under 50,000 people who left the profession between November 2013 and November 2014, the DfE said more than 13,000 had either died or retired. “Our figures also show that the vast majority 72% of newly qualified teachers are still in post after five years,” the spokesperson said.",Schools spending £1.3bn on supply teachers as staff shortage intensifies,partially false
3c20c6d1,"Can any government statistics on COVID-19 deaths be trusted?  It is an open question now that we are learning that the highly respected, world-class Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has been lying to us.  This revelation comes a few days after I wrote here at American Thinker that New York City was lying about COVID-19 deaths. The normal rules about reporting deaths have been violated by that city in the rush to inflate the body count, presumably to steer more taxpayer money to the Big Apple.  That the CDC isn’t telling the truth to Americans is no conspiracy theory: it’s right out there in the open for everyone to see. The CDC openly admits that it is fudging the COVID-19 death figures.  We know this because, among other truth-tellers, a plainspoken small-town physician from Kalispell, Montana, has pulled back the curtain.  Dr. Annie Bukacek, MD, explained in a presentation how death certificates are made. See “Montana physician Dr. Annie Bukacek discusses how COVID-19 death certificates are being manipulated,” YouTube, April 6  Why should anyone care how a certificate of death is made?  Everyone should care “today when governments are making massive changes that affect our constitutional rights and those changes are based on inaccurate statistics,” Bukacek says.  The system is deeply flawed, she argues.  Few people know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician, coroner, or medical examiner, signing the death certificate. How do I know this? I've been filling out death certificates for over 30 years. More often than we want to admit, we don’t know with certainty the cause of death when we fill out death certificates. That is just life. We are doctors, not God. Autopsies are rarely performed and even when an autopsy is done the actual cause of death is not always clear. Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form. Then that listed cause of death … is entered into a vital records data bank to use for statistical analysis, which then gives out inaccurate numbers, as you can imagine. Those inaccurate numbers then become accepted as factual information even though much of it is false.  This has been the way it has been done for some time, Bukacek says.  So even before we heard of COVID-19, death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned. When it comes to COVID-19 there is the additional data skewer, that is –get this— there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death. The Centers for Disease Control, updated from yesterday, April 4th, still states that mortality, quote unquote, data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19. That’s from their website. Translation? The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same. They call it death by COVID-19. They automatically overestimate the real death numbers, by their own admission. Prior to COVID-19, people were more likely to get an accurate cause of death written on their death certificate if they died in the hospital. Why more accurate when a patient dies in the hospital? Because hospital staff has physical examination findings labs, radiologic studies, et cetera, to make a good educated guess. It is estimated that 60 percent of people die in the hospital. But even [with] those in-hospital deaths, the cause of death is not always clear, especially in someone with multiple health conditions, each of which could cause the death.  Bukacek refers to a March 24 CDC memo from Steven Schwartz, director of the Division of Vital Statistics for the National Center for Health Statistics, titled “COVID-19 Alert No. 2.”  “The assumption of COVID-19 death,” she says, “can be made even without testing. Based on assumption alone the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty.”  There is a question-and-answer section on the memo.  One question is, “Will COVID-19 be the underlying cause?”  The answer is: “The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate. However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause more often than not.”  Another question is, “Should ‘COVID-19’ be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?”  The answer is:  “COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.” [Boldfacing in original]  “You could see how these statistics have been made to look really scary when it is so easy to add false numbers to the official database,” Bukacek says. “Those false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC.”  “The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think,” she says.  “How many people have actually died from COVID-19 is anyone’s guess … but based on how death certificates are being filled out, you can be certain the number is substantially lower than what we are being told. Based on inaccurate, incomplete data people are being terrorized by fearmongers into relinquishing cherished freedoms.”  It’s hard to argue with what Dr. Bukacek says, but no doubt angry social media mobs will find a way as her chilling words enlighten the populace that has been bullied into submission.  Of course, the disease’s body count is not the sole concern we should have about the Chinese contagion, but it is undeniably the primary driver of the rampant mass hysteria that has allowed state and local governments across America to crush our cherished civil liberties.  As they say in newsrooms: if it bleeds, it leads. Deaths are always going to be more “sexy” than confirmed cases. It is the number that really, really counts, and Americans know this.  The fraudulent death statistics also give ammunition to the legions of snitches and scolds who try to shame their fellow Americans for attending church or playing catch in an empty park or taking a harmless drive in the countryside to prevent themselves from going stir-crazy.  The fake death data from the CDC, coupled with wild guesstimates from experts, and the relentless barrage of fear porn the mainstream media subjects Americans to around the clock, have been getting results, even with a plague that is, so far at least, underperforming.  First, experts told us 2.2 million Americans would die. Then the number fell off a cliff, plunging down to around 200,000.  As of April 8, the number of those expected to die from the disease by August 4 was down to 60,000, or roughly a very nasty flu season. The new figure comes from the influential model produced by the University of Washington that the White House regularly cites.  Has social-distancing, wearing face masks, hosing down packages with bleach, using hand sanitizer that is at least 60 percent alcohol, and washing hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds helped bring the grim worst-case-scenario body count down?  Probably, I’m guessing, but it’s hard to know for sure.  Maybe those epidemiological modelers can be forgiven for scaring the bejeezus out of Americans. Epidemiology is not, after all, an exact science, as its practitioners sometimes acknowledge.  But those who have force-fed modelers skewed data that led to the terrifying death forecasts that stampeded governors into pushing the nation down the road to totalitarianism need to be held to account.

With HealthSource RI now operating, it appears that the 28 plans available for sale on the exchange 16 for small businesses, 12 for individuals and families fail to disclose the fact that they all include coverage for abortion-on-demand, that is, for abortions other than those in the cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the mother would be endangered.  According to RIRTL executive director Barth E. Bracy, We have been fighting in the General Assembly since 2011 trying to blunt Chafee's extreme agenda on government subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion-on-demand and, more recently, his imposition of a mandatory abortion fee on all Rhode Island individuals, families, and businesses who wish to purchase health insurance through HealthSource RI. Chafee's audacious yet constitutionally dubious end-run around the General Assembly has won the day for him and his fellow abortion-industry colleagues on the board of NARAL. Why are they trying to conceal their hard-fought victory?  Is Chafee worried, wonders Bracy that the lack of disclosure violates the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring plans that cover elective abortion to provide notice to enrollees as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation? Is he concerned that his exchange violates the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring the availability of at least one exchange-plan that does not provide coverage for elective abortion? Is he anxious that his administration might somehow have violated the provision of the Affordable Care Act that insurers cannot be required to provide coverage for elective abortion in their exchange-plans? Or is he simply aware that many Rhode Islanders would strongly disapprove of his machinations?  Under HealthSource RI, pro-life individuals, families, nonprofits, and small businesses are not free to purchase health insurance without paying a mandatory abortion fee, and thereby seriously violating their conscience and their principles. The Rhode Island State Right to Life Committee believes the citizens of Rhode Island deserve protection from this unprecedented government coercion and answers as to whether Chafee's mandatory abortion fee violates the law.

3c15ac92,"November 11, 2020 Victims of Voter Fraud: Initial Announcement of Deceased Georgians Used to Vote in 2020 General Election The American people deserve a free, fair, and fully transparent election in which every legal ballot is counted and every illegal ballot is not counted. Having confidence in our elections means knowing that votes are legally cast and that voters themselves are legally eligible to cast a ballot. Americans cannot have confidence in election results unless elected officials, law enforcement authorities, and fair-minded journalists take the issue of voter fraud seriously and investigate potential instances thoroughly. The Trump campaign will continue to bring these allegations to light, and the media and election authorities should vigorously examine them. Here are several examples in Georgia that should be investigated: Voter records show someone used the identity of Mrs. Deborah Jean Christiansen of Roswell, Georgia to vote in the recent election, even though Mrs. Christiansen passed away in May 2019. Further, someone registered Christiansen to vote on October 5, the day of the deadline to register, more than a year after she passed away. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran an obituary announcing Christiansen’s death at the time of her passing. Someone used the identity of James Blalock of Covington, Georgia to cast a ballot in last week’s election, even though Blalock died in 2006. Blalock’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution shortly after he passed away that year. Linda Kesler of Nicholson, Georgia died in 2003, but someone cast a ballot under her identity in last week’s election. Nicholson’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution when she passed away. Edward Skwiot of Trenton, Georgia is shown as having cast a ballot last week, even though he died in 2015. The Chattanooga Times Free Press ran a death notice in April of that year. These victims of voter fraud deserve justice, and legal voters should be able to have confidence that their votes are not rendered meaningless due to illegally cast votes.",Victims of Voter Fraud: Initial Announcement of Deceased Georgians Used to Vote in 2020 General Election,partially false
2f57c81f,"The California high-speed rail authority bowed to pressure from California legislators and members of Congress late Tuesday and released a copy of a 2013 report showing a large estimated increase in the cost of building the initial segment of the bullet train project.  The report, disclosed by the Times in a story Oct. 25, said Parsons Brinckerhoff had briefed state officials in October 2013 that the projected cost of the first phase of the bullet train system had risen 31%. The state did not use the increase, however, in its 2014 business plan four months later.  A dozen members of Congress and four members of the California assembly had written to the state and to Parsons Brinckerhoff asking for disclosure of the report.  Rail authority chairman Dan Richard and CEO Jeff Morales released the document and said the cost estimates it contained are part of an iterative process and that the numbers were “preliminary, still in development and subject to review clarification and refinement.” They say initial contracts have come in below budget.  Advertisement  “The authority under the present leadership has always been forthcoming about the costs and risks of the program,” Richard said.  Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said rail authority officials have agreed to appear at an upcoming hearing.  Rep. Jeff Denham R-Turlock, chairman of the House rail subcommittee, wrote to Parsons Brinckerhoff on Tuesday asking for the document. “Given the magnitude of the project, we have questions regarding the stewardship of federal funds by the California High Speed Rail Authority,” said the letter, co-signed by 11 Republicans from districts across the state.  The report shows that the cost of building the first segment from Burbank to Merced had grown from $27.3 billion to $35.7 billion, not including future inflation. The state publishes most of its public cost figures with future inflation included, which would translate the cost of the initial segment from the current $31 billion to about $40 billion, based on the Parsons Brinckerhoff estimates.  Advertisement  Interested in the stories shaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>  The document also shows the cost of the entire project would increase by about 5%, going from $54.4 billion to $56.9 billion without inflation. If future inflation is included, based on the Parsons Brinckerhoff inflation estimates, the total project cost would go from $68 billion to more than $71 billion.  The Parsons Brinckerhoff cost estimate projected that some of the initial cost increases would be offset by later savings, though that may come too late to help the program.  The authority asserted that the Times misrepresented the nature of the document, because it was a PowerPoint that was marked draft. The 22-page document, however, contains a vast amount of specific cost data, broken down by geographic segments, specific type of construction activities and phases of the project.  Advertisement  The Richard letter also disputes The Times’ analysis of tunneling challenges through the San Gabriel and Tehachapi mountains, saying that the authority has some of the world’s best tunneling experts and that their consultants “have reiterated their comfort level with our schedule and our approach.”  The Times quoted geologists and engineers who said the plan to complete about 36 miles of mountain tunnels by a 2022 deadline for starting rail operations was unrealistic.  The Times requested the Parsons Brinckerhoff report under the California Public Records Act, but was turned down under a provision of the law that exempts disclosures that are not in the public interest. A senior rail authority executive, Dennis Trujillo, signed the denial letter.  The Times subsequently obtained the report from an individual close to the project.  Advertisement  The letter from the House Republicans was addressed to Gregory Kelly, chief executive of Parsons Brinckerhoff. Asked for a response, a company spokeswoman said, “We are proud of the service Parsons Brinckerhoff has delivered on the California High-Speed Rail project. Please contact the media relations office at the Rail Authority directly for a response to your inquiry.”  Members of the California Assembly had asked the speaker to subpoena the cost document. Assemblyman Jim Patterson, whose district includes Fresno, took the lead in a letter to Atkins. Patterson said he has lost confidence in the project.  “They have failed to disclose huge cost overruns and after they boasted private firms were interested in funding this project, we now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money,” Patterson said. “What’s worse, we have learned that the [rail authority] ordered its own experts to keep their findings secret from the public.”  Richard, speaking on a Fresno radio talk show Tuesday, said the state is working to reduce the cost of the project below the current $68-billion estimate and that it has not withheld critical information from the public.  Advertisement  “The thing that offended me most about the [Times] article is that we have the most transparency of any agency,” Richard said.  Denham, however, said on the show that the state “continues to hide the facts.”  Denham has evolved into a potent critic of the project, as the Republican Party gained control of the House and then the Senate. He has vowed to cut any future funding for the project, which is facing at least a $16.3-billion shortfall to complete the initial operating segment by 2022.  ralph.vartabedian@latimes.com  Advertisement  Twitter: @rvartabedian  ALSO  Measure to restrict Airbnb rentals loses in San Francisco; Mayor Ed Lee reelected  LAPD to compile ‘much more comprehensive’ review of force, chief says  Advertisement  Pit bull Thor returns home to Texas after floods forced journey to California","At lawmakers’ urging, agency reveals report on growing bullet train costs",partially false

a7b20877,"Rashida Tlaib is busy at work during a national crisis that is keeping most school children at home. During this time, she’s decided to swoop in and take advantage of an already terrible situation.  She wants crews to move in on these schools, they let you do that when you’re a politician, and remove all of the American flags from every classroom in Michigan.  The argument for removing flags from all K-12 classrooms is simple. First, the lawsuit cites a rise in patriotism, which they feel must be “dealt with, stat.”  They also claim there are a number of kids at school who aren’t Americans and the flag makes them feel unwelcome.  In a new lawsuit filed in Michigan’s 9th Circuit Court, the filing states:  “Now is the time to end the discriminatory practice of having American flags in the classroom. There are many children who are either not American or don’t identify as Americans in our public schools. They have a right to attend a flag-free classroom.”  In addition, the Democrat politician also says the cost of these flags will free up the budget, which will allow a more diverse school lunch menu, that includes no pork, Halal, and Kosher meals.  The goal is to have all students returning to flag-free schools by this fall. They’ve also made it optional to replace the American flags in the classrooms with Rainbow Flags. Because they say kids love rainbow colors.  A spokesperson from the Federal Department of Education Joe Barron says:  “The Federal Government really needs to remain in our lane, so we cannot get involved in state matters. Just like we can’t act as a shipping company, we cannot act as the flag police. State rights matter.”  The fear is if Michigan gets away with this, other liberal states will follow.

You can unsubscribe at any time.  The total is 10 times the number officially recorded as being referred to specialist paediatric units, meaning the problem is significantly worse than first feared. Experts last night warned of a looming catastrophe with tens of thousands of young people expected to be diagnosed as diabetic in years to come. More than a third of children are leaving primary school overweight or obese. NHS consultant cardiologist and clean living campaigner Dr Aseem Malhotra said: These truly shocking figures reflect the gravest health crisis of our time, underpinned by a collective failure to give children the best start for a healthy life. This is due to a combination of factors including government failing to protect the public from the deliberate targeting of children by the junk food industry. It's also a failure of Public Health England to acknowledge that Type 2 is a condition of carbohydrate intolerance that can be reversed from eating a healthy diet.  I'm regularly giving dietary advice to my own patients suffering from weight problems and Type 2 to cut out ultra-processed foods. Essentially that's anything that comes out of a packet and has five or more ingredients should be eaten as an occasional treat, perhaps once a week, not daily. Treating The total of 6,836 sufferers under 25 was revealed by Diabetes UK and is based on the numbers treated in GP practices for the condition in England and Wales in 2016/17. Before this the most reliable data was from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health earlier this year which said paediatric diabetes units were treating only 715 people under the age of 25 for Type 2. Vascular surgeon Martin Claridge, one of the UK's leading authorities on the condition, said: This is the tip of the iceberg. There are going to be many more young people out in the community who have not yet been diagnosed. As a society we appear to be sleep walking into this crisis.  Type 2 diabetes is caused by obesity, lifestyle and poor diet  Already more than one child in five is obese or overweight in their first year of primary school, illustrating the scale of the timebomb facing the NHS. There is already a sugar tax on some soft drinks but campaigners say it should be extended to food, and drinks not subject to the levy, like milkshakes, some of which contain as much as 16 teaspoons of sugar. Supermarkets regularly advertise promotions aimed at children with family packs of branded chocolate and biscuits available for just £1. Even sports organisations stand accused of making the crisis worse. McDonald's has been a key commercial partner of the Football Association for 15 years. And earlier this year the FA renewed its long-standing partnership with confectionary giant Mars, which makes Mars bars, Milky Way, M&Ms, Skittles, Snickers, and Twix. The company is now the official supporter of the England men's, women's and disabled teams. Campaigners want all labelling of added sugars to be marked in teaspoons rather than grams, all sugary drinks advertising on TV and internet demand services outlawed, and companies associated with sugary products to be banned from sponsoring sporting events.  Birmingham has been shamed as Britain's diabetes capital, where one in 10 now has the disease. Type 1 diabetes, which is suffered by Theresa May, is not caused by diet. But Type 2 often is. A lifelong condition, it leads to serious complications such as blindness, amputations, heart disease and kidney failure It usually develops over the age of 40 in white Europeans or after 25 in people who are African-Caribbean, African, or South Asian. The condition is much more aggressive in children and young people than in adults, with a higher overall risk of complications that tend to appear much earlier. The risk of developing Type 2 is significantly increased by 33 percent being overweight or obese. Bridget Turner, Diabetes UK's director of policy and campaigns, said: Type 2 can be devastating for children and young people. To help shape a future where fewer children develop the condition, we need continued commitment across society to create an environment that reduces obesity. We need to encourage healthy living by providing viding Treating each clear and easy to understand nutritional information about the products we are all buying, and protect children from adverts for foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar.  Ways to prevent becoming a diabetic  Overall, more than four million people in the UK have diabetes and a further 12 million living chronically unhealthy lifestyles are at increased risk of Type 2. The disease has become a huge drain on the NHS, costing £14billion a year to treat – or £1million every hour. The number of related prescriptions issued the disease year has rocketed by 80 percent in a decade. The Department of Health and Social Care said: We are committed to halving child obesity by 2030 and will be launching consultations to restrict promotions in shops for sugary and fatty foods, as well as a 9pm watershed ban on advertising. The upcoming NHS longterm plan will have prevention at its core.  How sufferers are affected Affecting around 90 percent of diabetes sufferers, Type 2 is usually caused by lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet. It occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or the hormone does not work properly, and is more common in people over the age of 30. Often diagnosed in childhood, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin and it is not produced at all. As insulin regulates the amount of glucose allowed into the body, both types cause a build up of blood sugar that can cause serious health problems.  Consumption of too many sugary drinks can cause Type 2 diabetes  Sugary drinks cause a 'greater risk' Artificially sweetened drinks put people at a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than other sugary foods, a study has warned. Researchers found that products with added fructose introduce excess nutrient poor energy into the diet and can have a harmful effect on blood sugar levels. However that was not the case with food and drink where fructose occurs naturally such as in whole fruit and juice, vegetables and honey. Previously it was unclear whether avoiding food where free sugars occur naturally could also be beneficial.  The current advice is just to reduce the amount of items where free sugars are added such as soft drinks, breakfast cereals, sweets and desserts. Researchers compiled results from 155 studies that looked into how different foods containing fructose sugars affect blood glucose levels in people with and without diabetes. They found most foods containing fructose sugars do not have a harmful effect on blood glucose levels as long as they do not provide too many calories. Fruit and juice may even have beneficial effects on blood glucose and insulin control, especially in people with diabetes. But foods that add excess nutrient poor energy to the diet, especially sweetened drinks, seem to have the most harmful effects on health. The researchers, based in the Canadian city of Toronto, said the higher fibre content of fruit could help to explain the improvements in blood glucose levels, as it slows down the release of sugars. Lead author Dr John Sievenpiper said more studies were needed but added: These findings might help guide recommendations on important food sources of fructose in diabetes prevention and management. Public health professionals should be aware harmful effects of fructose sugars on blood glucose seem to be mediated by energy and food source.  Only decisive action now will be able to halt crisis Comment by Robin Hewings WITH one in three children either overweight or obese before they leave primary school, it is now clearer than ever that bold, decisive action needs to be taken. In the latest chapter of its Childhood Obesity Plan, the Government laid out its commitment to halving childhood obesity by 2030. Our latest analysis provides yet more evidence that the Government, and industry, urgently need to turn these commitments into action. Type 2 diabetes is a serious, life-long condition that can lead to devastating complications. What we're seeing in these new figures is that obesity is driving this alarming increase in the number of children and young people with the condition, which is potentially setting them up for a lifetime of poor health.  Robin Hewings [twitter.com/RobinHewings]  The NHS must provide appropriate specialist services to support children with Type 2 to manage the condition and reduce the risk of serious complications. But the diabetes crisis is one that must be fought on many fronts. We want to see continued funding within the NHS for preventing Type 2 and a commitment to the improvement of care services which reflects the seriousness of this growing epidemic. And the fact is, we live in a society where making the healthy choice is not always the easy choice.","Shocking rise in child diabetes: 7,000 youngsters have Type 2 in ‘gravest health crisis'",FALSE
98344ef0,"Right Country – Oprah is part of this country’s elite and this country’s elite are full of pedophiles and perverts. She is no exception. The famous talk show host said that if a child molester is “any good” their victims won’t even know they’re being molested. It will “feel good” to children, Oprah claimed in a segment of one of her special’s on sexual abuse in 2017.  This is a downright disgusting thing to assert about child molestation. It’s doubtful that any victims of childhood molestation look back and think about how “good” it felt. Since Oprah made the comments in 2017 there was backlash and Oprah was forced to acknowledge such.  Here’s what Oprah’s website says in reference to the disturbing comments and one viewers perspective:  One comment Oprah made during her interview with four child predators touched a nerve with some viewers. During the discussion, Oprah said if an abuser does his or her job well, the abuse feels good. This can add to a victim’s feelings of shame and confusion. A survivor of sexual abuse, Diane, calls in to share a differing viewpoint, based on her own violent childhood. “I just wanted to make people aware that it’s not always that you’re going to feel good or get pleasure from [sexual abuse]. A lot of times, it’s fear and intimidation. It’s abuse,” she says. “It’s the fear of being beat again. It’s the abuser using abuse to get you to do what they want.” Diane says it never felt good from the first time she was raped at 9 years old until the abuse stopped just before her 13th birthday. “There was violence throughout my childhood,” she says. “He abused us enough that, when he said he was going to do something, we believed it.” Diane says she and her sister, who was abused by the same man, were intimidated into keeping their terrible secret. “When he said he would kill us, we believed him,” she says. Oprah says she understands where survivors like Diane are coming from. “There are many situations where that happens,” she says. “And as I’ve said before on this show, I’m speaking broadly and in, of course, general terms.”  Maybe Diane’s abuser was simply just not doing it “right.” Child molestation is supposed to “feel good” to children, apparently, not intimidate them or scare them. Diane just had a really lousy abuser.  Asserting that sexual abuse “feels good” to young children is just another attempt at normalizing it. How can it be that harmful, after all, if it feels good. Convincing young children that sexual abuse, when done “right,” should feel good is an appalling and disgusting way to desensitize children to abuse.  Since Oprah launched the series meant to bring awareness to sexual abuse she has spoken with numerous victims and even convicted child molesters. One of these child molesters explained when he was 10 or 11 he was groomed and subsequently molested and then grew up to then follow in those same footsteps.  Grooming is a psychologically damaging process to any child and it’s the very reason why so many victims of child sexual abuse end up abusing children when they grow up. That’s exactly why it’s so dangerous to put out ideas like when child molesting is done “right” it “feels good.”",Appalling: Oprah Says That When Done “Right” Child Molestation Should Feel “Good” To Children,FALSE

6183dd49,"Brexit is pushing up the price of a bacon butty as China exploits the weak pound to hoover up British pork amid its own domestic shortage.  China’s farming industry has been devastated by severe flooding, which has forced suppliers to look further afield for their pork.  The added demand from China has pushed up EU pork exports to the People’s Republic by 60%, to reach 1.2m tonnes in the first six months of the year.  Much of China’s appetite has been sated by British meat exports, which have become cheaper for foreign buyers thanks to the weakness of sterling following the Brexit vote.  The result has been a 40,000-tonne rise in pig meat exports, up 31% on the first half of last year.  Some shop suppliers have raised their prices by up to 38%, according to purchasing company Beacon, causing price increases at the till of up to 19%, as supermarkets pass the cost on to consumers. It added that high prices would persist.  “The combination of such huge demand for British pork from China and the devaluing of sterling following Brexit is impacting our breakfast tables,” said Emma Warrington, a senior food buyer at Beacon.  “Figures from our butchery suppliers show the price of British bacon rising, in some cases substantially, with data from [butcher] Birtwistles showing that the spike in demand was equal to an additional 30,000 tonnes in the first six months of 2016.  “All of this means we might be paying a higher price for a bacon sandwich for the foreseeable future.”  China’s paucity of pigs has been caused by severe floods, which have affected millions of people and left pig farmers struggling to protect their livestock.  The European farming industry has also felt the effect of flooding, which Beacon warned could pile on the misery for anyone who likes chips with their bacon butty.  It said the floods had affected potato crop quality and quantity, which is set to drive up prices for chips and other potato products.    Britain’s vote to leave the European Union – and the subsequent drop in the value of sterling – has triggered a string of warning about the cost of goods, including supermarket produce, holidays and bottles of wine.    The Consumer Prince Index measure of inflation reached 0.6% in July, the highest level in 20 months, with many economists saying the effect on inflation has yet to be felt in full.  Some industries such as domestic tourism are reporting benefits as the weak pound makes the UK a more attractive place for foreign visitors. Swiss luxury watch firms have reported a boom in tourists buying timepieces in the UK.  The most recent health-check on the state of the UK’s manufacturing sector also lent some weight to claims that the weakness of the pound will prove a boon to exporters.  Manufacturing exports rose to their highest level in two years in the three months to the end of July, according to quarterly survey data from the Confederation of British Industry.  But economists have warned not to read too much into one export figure. The CBI said it was not all good news for UK firms that do business with overseas clients.  The business lobby group said the currency effect was a “double-edged sword”, with manufacturers likely to feel the pinch as the cost of imported materials rises.",Brexit vote pushes up price of bacon as China hoovers up British pork,FALSE
a85f1aac,"US Under Military Law, Congress Arrested, War With CCP Won and No One Knows It      Joe Biden was sworn in as president of a bankrupt and defunct US Inc. Corporation. Just prior to his pre-recorded-in-Hollywood-by-Castle Rock Entertainment Inauguration, Washington DC, Capitol Hill and the White House were secured within miles of barbed wire fences and 60,000 National Guard troops.  Now over a week later, over 30,000 troops and the barbed wire fencing remained. Why?  An answer came early Mon. morning 25 Jan. when from 3am to 6am arrests of 80 to 140 Congress people appeared to be underway at Capitol Hill – after which Congress seemed to have disappeared. Why? https://www.bitchute.com/video/oYzu0wcwa3GE/ House cancels business during first full Biden week – Washington Times US Military at the White House Arresting Congress | Politics | Before It’s News  In reality an Interim Military US Government had taken over Washington DC and was running our country. The two US governments: 1 a legitimate Interim Military US Government empowered by the Constitution and the Department of Defense under Military Code 11.3, and 2 an illegal, fraudulent foreign paid-for, foreign controlled on the foreign ground of the District of Columbia Biden Administration.  The US Military appeared to be in charge of Biden and making him sign blank Executive Orders on a stage set of the Oval Office. The White House was said to be empty. Why? https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=164754  The whole operation began way last Jan. 2020 during a government shutdown. President Trump was said to have reorganized several agencies including the US Treasury, IRS and Federal Reserve. Now the US Military had control of all assets including taxpayer dollars at the new US Treasury near Reno. Why?  The Military had been tasked with conducting a return to a gold/asset-backed dollar and to insure that the US Republic was restored to original laws of the Constitution as written prior to 1871. http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=115613  This was all made possible after a Sat. 9 Jan 2021 raid by US Military Special Op Teams on CIA Headquarters in Langley Virginia. The raid produced firm evidence that the CIA, Democrats and other traitors had conspired with foreign entities led by the Chinese Communist Party CCP, to interfere in the 2020 Election.  Earlier that Saturday morning 9 Jan. there had been two attempts on Trump and his wife Melania’s lives there were said to have been twelve plus such attempts since he gained office.  Trump had had enough. He immediately instigated the Insurrection Act put into law by George Bush Jr. after 9/11, and then turned his authority over to the US Military.  With the nation now under Martial Law, Trump would remain as US President until all those who committed treason were arrested, including those who certified the illegal 2020 Election.  Some in the Pentagon had been preparing for this for over twenty years. US Attorney General for Utah John Huber and his 740 investigators had been very busy since 2016. The US government was corrupt throughout including Congress and the three letter agencies. There were a lot of traitors whose cases had already been processed through State Grand Juries. There was an estimated 80 to 140 Congress people thought named in over 223,000 sealed indictments filed in federal courts since Trump took office.  Of those, 85% to 95% indicted were Democrats, intermixed with a few Rino Republicans. The majority of charges were said to be pedophilia, child exploitation, misappropriation of US Taxpayer funds and conspiring with foreign powers to influence the 2020 Presidential Election – an act of Treason. Some serious charges couldn’t be brought because Obama pardoned so many in his last days in office.  By Jan. 2 2020 Military Tribunals were said to have already began at GITMO for high profile elites such as the Clintons, Obamas and Bushes. Charges against them were believed to include Capital High Treason, Election Fraud, Child Sex Trafficking, Money Laundering, Misappropriation of US Taxpayer Funds, plus Uranium One, 9/11 and Benghazi crimes.  Deep State Special prosecutor Robert Mueller was believed to have been charged for his involvement in the 9/11 cover-up he was appointed FBI Director 7 days before 9/11 and oversaw 9/11 so-called “investigations”, plus he conducted an ongoing fake Russian witch-hunt against Trump. https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/168059921/  It was no wonder the Democrats wanted to impeach Trump, again. On Thurs. 28 Jan. certain traitors in both the House and Senate did in fact recognize Trump as the acting US President when they voted, again, to try to impeach him. Under rules of the Constitution you could not impeach a US President if he didn’t presently hold the office.  Donald Trump wasn’t worried about being impeached from the presidency of the bankrupt and defunct US Corporation. He had other plans. On 11 Jan. 2021 Donald Trump was inaugurated as head of the Patriot or Constitutional Party, which made him a candidate for US President, again.  The US Military was about to restore the US Republic to laws underlying the original Constitution as written prior to 1871. That election was planned to be held on 4 March 2021 through use of a transparent, secure and instantaneous Quantum Voting Computer where citizens could vote using their own computers, or phones.  For many years the Chinese Communist Party not the Chinese government, which was working to become a democracy had been involved in a takeover of America. That war culminated when just prior to the 2020 US Presidential Election, the CCP bought Dominion Voting machines that through use of an Italian satellite loaned with money at the Vatican, threw what was believed to be millions of Trump votes to Biden. And, the CIA raid proved it all.  The war between the CCP and the US actually ended on Thurs. 28 Jan. Former Navy Intelligence officer Simeon Parkes reported a showdown in the South China Sea. The CCP had been trying to take over Taiwan. Taiwan was where gold was stored that would back countries including the US, for a Global Currency Reset. Parks said that there were air battles between America and Taiwan fighter jets against CCP jets and “the CCP lost big time.”  The New World Order fans had lost their war. A banker source out of Zurich said they had promised to settle everything by Fri. 29 Jan. https://www.simonparkes.org/blog  Rinus Verhagen reported that “the CCP has abandoned their Big Restart Operation and the liberal elite-scheduled reboot of Globalism has failed. Operation COVID-19, expressed in the book “Great Restoration” by Klaus Schwab, President of the Davos Global Economic Forum, has also failed. The CCP would not impose a Global Order. Their power, like any commercial empire, was limited to an economic expansion.” http://www.takecare4.eu/panic-in-dc/ Take care 4 –  Please Support beforeitsnews, By Trying Some Of Our Health Products, By Following This Link To Our Health Supplement Store!

Vote Now Yes No  A Democrat operative revealed that the United States Postal Service USPS workers who share a mutual disdain for the 45th President, Donald Trump, will sometimes help election fraudsters by throwing in the garbage mail-in ballots from Republican-heavy neighborhoods, according to Breitbart News.  A Democrat operative told the New York Post‘s Jon Levine a number of stories in which insiders like him lead teams of fraudsters to commit election fraud by paying homeless voters off, taking advantage of the elderly, posing as registered voters, and printing up fake ballots.  “You have a postman who is a rabid anti-Trump guy and he’s working in Bedminster or some Republican stronghold … He can take those [filled-out] ballots, and knowing 95% are going to a Republican, he can just throw those in the garbage.” [Emphasis added]  “You have a postman who is a rabid anti-Trump guy and he’s working in Bedminster or some Republican stronghold … He can take those [filled-out] ballots, and knowing 95% are going to a Republican, he can just throw those in the garbage.”  “In some cases, mail carriers were members of his “work crew,” and would sift ballots from the mail and hand them over to the operative.”  “At this point, we can confirm that a small number of military ballots were discarded,” DOJ officials said in a statement:  “Investigators have recovered nine ballots at this time. Some of those ballots can be attributed to specific voters and some cannot. Of the nine ballots that were discarded and then recovered, seven were cast for presidential candidate Donald Trump. Two of the discarded ballots had been resealed inside their appropriate envelopes by Luzerne [County] elections staff prior to recovery by the FBI and the contents of those 2 ballots are unknown.”  The disturbing tactic was most recently used in the swing district of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and Justice Department DOJ say mail-in ballots by members of the United States Armed Forces cast for Trump were “discarded.”  More from Breitbart:",Democrat Insider: Anti-Trump Postal Workers In GOP Neighborhoods Throw Mail-In Ballots In The Garbage,FALSE

An Interim Military US Government was actually running the US and they saw President Biden as a treasonous agent. A few days before Joe Biden’s Inauguration and due to foreign interference in the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump had instigated the Insurgency Act, declared Martial Law and deferred his power to the US Military.  Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House.

Code-named “Vault 7” by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.  The first full part of the series, “Year Zero”, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.  Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.  “Year Zero” introduces the scope and direction of the CIA’s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.  Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency NSA. The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency’s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA its primary bureaucratic rival in order to draw on the NSA’s hacking capacities.  By the end of 2016, the CIA’s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency’s Center for Cyber Intelligence CCI, had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other “weaponized” malware. Such is the scale of the CIA’s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its “own NSA” with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.  In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.  Once a single cyber ‘weapon’ is ‘loose’ it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.  Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that “There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber ‘weapons’. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such ‘weapons’, which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of “Year Zero” goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.”  Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the “Year Zero” disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of ‘armed’ cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should analyzed, disarmed and published.  Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in “Year Zero” for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in “Vault 7” part one “Year Zero” already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.",“KRAKEN” is a CIA Hacking Program,FALSE
5dc31757,"New Mexico lawmakers are swiftly on their way toward legalizing the killing of unborn babies in abortions up to birth for years to come.  The Daily Post reports the state Health and Human Services Committee passed House Bill 7 with bipartisan support on Wednesday. The vote was 8-3, and the bill now heads to the state House Judiciary Committee.  The pro-abortion bill would repeal a 1969 statute that prohibits abortions except in cases of rape, incest or threats to the mother’s life. The statute is not in effect because of Roe v. Wade, but if it is repealed, the state would continue to allow unborn babies to be aborted for any reason up to birth even if Roe is overturned.  It also would repeal the only conscience protections for pro-life medical workers in New Mexico. Currently, the law protects doctors, nurses and other medical workers from discrimination if they refuse to abort an unborn baby based on “moral or religious grounds.”  A state Senate committee passed an almost identical bill earlier this week.  However, pro-life leaders and medical workers are pushing back, saying the bill would strip away vital protections for healthcare workers, babies and mothers.  “Regardless of your position on abortion, no one should be forced to participate, to violate her most deeply held principles or the reason she entered the medical field – to save lives,” Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, told the committee prior to the vote.  Foster said tens of thousands of healthcare providers in New Mexico would lose their conscience rights and they could sue the state for violating their religious freedom.  During a Senate hearing earlier in the week, state Sen. Gregg Schmedes, R-Sandoval, warned that doctors may leave New Mexico if the bill passes.  “Though some of the existing law is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals,” Schmedes said, according to the Los Alamos Reporter. “As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans.”  But state Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, a sponsor of the bill, argued that the 1969 statute needs to be repealed because it is “outdated and dangerous.”  “Pregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion,” Cadena said. “By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.”  The AP predicts the bill will pass the Democrat-controlled state legislature. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a pro-abortion Democrat, also supports it.  But pro-lifers are not giving up hope. Elisa Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for Life, urged New Mexico residents to call their lawmakers and urge them to reject the bill.  “The radical abortion lobby seeks to force medical professionals across New Mexico to perform abortions as a matter of ‘access.’ This is not a pro-woman bill but rather, a pro-abortion lobby bill,” Martinez said.  In 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers defeated a similar pro-abortion bill in the state Senate. However, many of the Democrat lawmakers who voted against it no longer serve in the legislature.  The bill is similar to laws that passed recently in New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. New Jersey also is considering a bill to expand the killing of unborn babies in abortions this year.

1502bd12,"During the Republican National convention, President Trump spent a lot of time covering the dangers and ill-advised policies of a Biden administration. An America under the supervision of the radical Democrat candidate seems, at least to his watchful eye, a disaster in the making with our very lives and freedoms in serious jeopardy.  Just recently, Biden confirmed one of those very fears during a campaign speech at the Joe Barron Jewish community center in Pohtaytoe, Virginia, referring to the sacred and God-blessed second amendment right of all Americans to own and use firearms at any time anywhere for any reason whatsoever as “obsolete.” Clearly, this is either a case of Trump being right on the money, or a satirical article to drive gullible trumpers into blood pressure fits.  Supporters of the President constitute the country’s least educated and most violently gullible of citizens, and do, in fact, believe idiotic things about the amendment that are laughably untrue.

The first was when Trump himself suggested “taking the guns and worrying about the legal stuff later.” The second was when Trump lied and said that Biden was coming after it. To no great shock, Trump’s parade of happy dipshits ignored the first and blew their own balls off about the second.  The history of gun-grabbing is long and storied, and always pushed as a fear tactic by republicans.

e21d7e94,"The panel formed to consider proposed pay raises for New York State legislators has until mid November to submit its recommendation. There are differences in opinion among lawmakers, downstate and upstate, whether they need to earn larger checks.  WBFO's Michael Mroziak reports.  State lawmakers currently earn $79,500 per year. The commission now pondering a pay raise for lawmakers is said to be considering a 47 percent increase, which would raise legislator salaries to nearly $119,000 annually.  The panel, which previously recommended a $29,000 increase in annual pay for judges, has until November 15 to decide on legislators' pay.  The state constitution requires lawmakers earn the same wage. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is among the downstate lawmakers hoping for a raise. A Bronx native, Heastie points to a higher cost of living in that part of New York State.  When the salary was 79-thousand five-hundred, that purchasing power has now been reduced to 53-thousand dollars, said Heastie during a visit to Buffalo late last week. Legislators have children that they need to help go to college. They have real lives.  Some of Heastie's peers, though, are satisfied with what they're earning now. Buffalo-based Assemblyman Sean Ryan is among those not supporting a raise. However, he appreciates why his downstate colleagues want one.  We happen to be attached to a state that has one of the highest costs of living in only a part of the state, said Ryan. That's why it's been an issue that's been struggled with for 19 years and there's been no changes made.  Some argue that allowing the salary increase might motivate lawmakers to agree to reforms. Ryan does not want one to become a condition for the other.  That's not the path we want to go down, he said. We've been talking about ethics reform for the last three years now.

45ef7d05,"Energy bills would soar by £500m a year if the UK left the EU, Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, will claim on Thursday.  In remarks dismissed by leave campaigners as “absurd”, the cabinet minister will deliver the latest in a series of warnings from senior government figures about the costs of Brexit.  These have included claims that 600,000 jobs in the drinks industry would be safer inside the EU and that lamb and beef farmers could face an extra £330m a year bill to export their goods.  In a speech, Rudd will say the UK’s membership of the EU has “helped keep our energy bills down”.  “If we left the European Internal Market, we’d get a massive electric shock because UK energy costs are likely to rocket by at least half a billion pounds a year – the equivalent of British bills going up by around £1.5m pounds each and every day,” she will say.  She cited a report, commissioned by the National Grid, which she said found that leaving the EU, and exiting the internal energy market, could cost consumers £500m or more each year. This is the equivalent of £20 per household – or about a third less when business consumption is taken into account.  The EU also provides a protection against being bullied by Vladimir Putin over Russian gas, Rudd will tell employees during a visit to the site of an interconnector pipeline in Kent, which brings electricity supplies from the continent.  “Relying on energy from abroad is not without risk. We have seen how countries such as Putin’s Russia use their gas supplies as a tool of foreign policy. Threatening to cut off supplies or drastically increase prices,” she will say.    “We can’t let our energy security be hijacked as a political pawn to bring Europe to its knees. By working together in the European Union each member state can stop this becoming a reality.  “As a bloc of 500 million people, we have the power to force Putin’s hand. We can coordinate our response to a crisis. We can use the power of the internal market to source gas from elsewhere. We can drive down the price of imports, as has happened recently in eastern Europe.    “To put it plainly – when it comes to Russian gas, united we stand, divided we fall.”  Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said: “Amber Rudd’s absurd claims simply aren’t backed up by her own research.  “It is quite extraordinary the extent to which the government is willing to do down Britain in its desperate attempt to win the referendum. In fact the EU makes our energy bills more expensive and costs us £350m a week.  “If we want cheaper bills, less commission interference and the ability to spend our money on our priorities, then the safe option is to Vote Leave.”",Energy secretary warns of £500m 'electric shock' after Brexit,FALSE
3886ead8,"The bombshell claim comes from over 20 hours of Grand Jury testimony released on Friday in the Breonna Taylor case.  Taylor has become the most prominent example from the media, politicians and celebrities that law enforcement must reform from systematic racism.  Much of those claims were already falling apart before today’s news. Taylor was not sleeping in her bed as was suggested but next to her boyfriend in the hallway as officers were being shot at.  Cops were not at the wrong house as was suggested but rather Taylor was the focus of a months long investigation as conspiring with her ex-boyfriend to receive mail and money from an alleged drug operation.  Also revealed months ago was Taylor being interviewed by law enforcement after a car she had rented contained a homicide victim.  According to the Daily Mail, the Grand Jury was presented with evidence that at the scene, Taylor’s boyfriend told cops that it was in fact Taylor that shot at cops.  Among the recordings released is Officer Brett Hankison’s interview with investigators that said Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, had told him ‘she was the one who shot at us’.  Walker later confessed that he was the one who opened fire.  One of Taylor’s neighbors also told investigators that police had told her that ‘some drug-dealing girl shot an officer’.  Officers had a ‘no-knock’ warrant to search Taylor’s apartment for drugs the night when she she was killed and the mainstream media has pushed the false claim that they are “illegal”, and in turn several agencies have abandoned the practice.  In fact, while the warrant was “no knock”, testimony from officers and witnesses revealed that law enforcement spent almost a minute knocking and announcing before using a ram to enter the residence.  ‘We knocked on the door, said police, waited I don’t know 10 or 15 seconds. Knocked again, said police, waited even longer,’ Louisville, Kentucky, police Lt. Shawn Hoover said in an interview recorded the day Taylor was shot.  ‘So it was the third time that we were approaching, it had been like 45 seconds if not a minute,’ Hoover said. ‘And then I said, ‘Let’s go, let’s breach it’.’  In an interview with investigators that was played to the grand jury, Walker said that if officers had announced themselves, ‘it changes the whole situation because there was nothing for us to be scared of.’  One law enforcement officer testified that police ultimately never executed the warrant to search Taylor’s apartment.  ‘Were drugs money or paraphernalia recovered from apartment 4? … The answer to that is no,’ the officer said on the recording.  ‘They didn’t go forward with executing the initial search warrant that they had for Breonna Taylor’s apartment.’  Police used a narcotics warrant to enter Taylor’s Louisville apartment on March 13. The 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was shot five times.  Cameron said two officers who fired their guns, hitting Taylor, were justified because Taylor’s boyfriend had shot at them first. The boyfriend has said he thought someone was breaking in.  The grand jury did charge fired Officer Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighboring apartment. No one was hit.  While the additional information may be shocking to some, what should be more of a concern is the “breaking” story from a foreign media outlet which only shows just how corrupt the American media is.  The same media that never demanded body camera footage in the George Floyd case or even bothered to report that the “neck” restraint was an approved tactic by the agency, are the same ones trying to convince the world that Taylor was simply an innocent girl sleeping in her bed.  We agree with Journalist Jason Whitlock. Indeed, what happened to Taylor is tragic, but to overlook a series of bad decisions on her part to allegedly associate with a known drug dealer and help assist his operation and blame the cops for executing a legal search warrant where they were shot, is plain ridiculous.",Breaking: Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend says SHE opened fire on cops,FALSE

Donald Harris, a Stanford University economics professor and father of 2020 Democrat candidate, wrote about how they are descendant of an Irishman who owned a slave plantation in Jamaica in a piece titled “Reflections of a Jamaican Father.”  “My roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy née Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown’s Town,” Mr. Harris wrote in his article for Jamaica Global.  The Free Beacon reports that “a research archive of Jamaican records indicate that at one point in 1817, Hamilton Brown owned scores of slaves. The majority were brought in from Africa, though he also owned many Creole slaves.”  Harris has been pushing for “some form of reparations for black people,” saying that “we have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities.” Something her own family history reflects.  McConnell has responded to the reports about his ancestors by pointing out that the family of former President Barack Obama also owned slaves.  “You know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,” McConnell said. “We both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.”",Flashback: Father of Kamala Harris Details on How Their Ancestors Owned Slaves,TRUE

Projects funded through the £14billion budget include schemes to boost China’s film industry and to improve its museums.  Britain is legally committed to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on foreign aid, but the Commons international development committee called for that money to be focused on poverty reduction.  MPs singled out the £600million Prosperity Fund, a cross-Whitehall pot that is still used to pay for foreign aid schemes in India and China.  MPs singled out the £600million Prosperity Fund, a cross-Whitehall pot that is still used to pay for foreign aid  They raised questions about how it was funding projects in China to reduce tobacco consumption by migrant workers and to lower the salt intake of children.  The MPs said many of the dubious ventures were being run by Boris Johnson’s Foreign Office FCO. ‘Among the FCO-administered Prosperity Fund projects, we found many weaker examples including projects to develop the Chinese film industry, improve the Chinese museum infrastructure and improve the credit bond rating system in China,’ they said.  The committee said it was unclear ‘how these types of interventions will benefit the very poorest people’. It called for a review of existing programmes.  ‘We are concerned to have uncovered Prosperity Fund projects within middle-income countries which show inadequate, or negligible, targeting at improving the lives of the very poorest and most vulnerable communities in these countries,’ the report said.  Whitehall departments were also condemned for not being open about how they are doling out the £14billion budget.  Although most of the foreign aid budget is used by the Department for International Development Dfid, other Government departments are increasingly having to help to get the money out the door.  More than a quarter 27.5 per cent of the aid budget was spent by departments other than Dfid last year.  The report said while Dfid was ‘respected worldwide as an accountable deliverer of aid’, there was a lack of transparency elsewhere in Whitehall.  The committee warned that other Government departments were being given aid money to spend without having to explain how they would make sure it was used properly.  The MPs said many of the dubious ventures were being run by Boris Johnson’s Foreign Office  The MPs said yesterday: ‘Given the level of spending involved, we are concerned that departments are not publishing fuller details of their... spending as this lack of clarity clouds the public’s ability to see good and bad spending.’  They highlighted the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund CSSF, which redacts information and refuses to publish how it uses much of its money.

VILLA HILLS, Kentucky, February 25, 2021 LifeSiteNews — Earlier this month, 35 nuns in a northern Kentucky convent received an mRNA-developed COVID-19 vaccine. Just two days later, two died and twenty six others tested positive for the virus. Sister Aileen Bankemper, prioress of the Benedictine Sisters of St. Walburg, noted that the monastery was completely locked down, with no movement of people into or out of the premises for some time prior to having the sisters vaccinated: “We [the Benedictine community] were shocked to have so many [COVID-19] cases since we were being extremely careful, not going out, and not having visitors since the beginning of the pandemic,” Fox19 NOW reported. She even claimed that the sisters “redoubled our efforts after the [Christmas] holiday surge.” Sister Aileen confirmed in a Facebook post, “Twenty-eight sisters tested positive for COVID-19,” following the jab. “The majority of them were able to get the monoclonal antibodies [antibody infusions] through St. Elizabeth’s Senior Services. Their symptoms are being managed pretty well,” she added. Two of their members, however, Sister Charles Wolking and Sister Rita Biltz, quickly deteriorated, dying on February 3, two days after receiving their COVID jabs. Neither had expressed symptoms nor had tested positive for the virus prior to taking the vaccine. Sub-Prioress Sister Nancy Kordenbrok told WKRC that “[b]oth of them were elderly and had some health issues and were not able to compete with COVID.” At the time, a third sister, Margaret Mary Gough, was admitted to ICU at St. Elizabeth Fort Thomas Hospital with respiratory problems after testing positive for COVID-19 following her first dose of the vaccine. Sister Nancy initially expressed hope that Sister Margaret Mary was recovering, saying that she is “[c]urrently in ICU, but we think she will be moved from there. She’s doing so much better. She had serious respiratory issues.” But yesterday, through the monastery’s official Facebook page, she too was confirmed to have died, on February 10, “from complications of the COVID virus.” One other sister recovered in ICU and was able to return to the monastery. In an apparent attempt to quell fears about the dangers of the vaccine, Dr. Steven Feagins, the Hamilton County public health director, explained that strong side-effects are “actually way more common than you might think.” He added that, in cases where the patient suffers side-effects, he recommends simply delaying the second dose: “Whenever you get it, you get it, so we consider the 21 days [between jabs] minimum,” he said. The remaining sisters are set to receive their second dose of the vaccine in May. Since the launch of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS has recorded a total of 929 deaths from December 15, 2020, up to February 12, 2021, accounting for almost 6% of 15,923 adverse events on the system’s report. 1,869 people were hospitalized, 616 of whom were considered to have suffered a life-threatening reaction. Roughly 66.5 million doses have been administered in the U.S. of either one of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations offered by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Both were given emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration FDA in December, and, until they are fully licenced by the regulator, are considered experimental. — Article continues below Petition — Show Petition Text 0 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Hide Petition Text Sign this Petition During LifeSiteNews’ “Unmasking COVID-19” conference, Dr. Sheri Tenpenny, Dr. Eric Nepute and Dr. Pam Popper joined LifeSite’s Stephen Kokx in a panel discussion focused on the science regarding the vaccines, and whether it is right to regard them as the chief protection against COVID-19. The medics decried even calling the injections “vaccines,” since they did not meet the standards necessary for the term, and warned about the risk of the experimental products themselves attacking the body’s immune response system. Tenpenny argued that the currently available vaccines do not merit the name vaccine since they don’t “meet any of the standards by which a vaccine is supposed to work: to prevent the spread of infection, to keep you from getting sick, to keep you from being hospitalized, to decrease the amount of illness, to protect people from this contagion that’s out there. It doesn’t meet any of those standards.” Describing the vaccine manufacturers as having “skipped all the steps” of normal testing and development procedures, Popper noted that “we have no possible hope that this could actually be either safe or effective.” The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency MHRA, which authorized the use of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca developed COVID vaccines for use in Britain, reported that, between December 8 and February 14, it “has received 197 U.K. reports of suspected ADRs to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in which the patient died shortly after vaccination, 205 reports for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, and 4 where the brand of vaccine was unspecified.” “The majority of these reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness,” the MHRA added. Italy, too, reported major health concerns regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine after the Tribuna di Treviso newspaper reported “dozens and dozens” of teachers and professors in the Treviso region were too ill to teach on Monday morning, having received the vaccine over the weekend. Consequently, two middle schools had to close during the week due to a lack of staff. Despite the numerous side-effects reported by those who received the vaccine, Michele Mongillo, the director of prevention and public health for the Veneto Region maintained an optimistic position on the effect of AstraZeneca’s abortion-tainted vaccine: “We have begun the vaccination with AstraZeneca this week; there have been a few local reactions, especially fever. Over six thousand doses were given, and a few cases of local reactions were reported to our offices. It’s a temporary phenomenon, and on the bright side it shows that the immune system is reacting to the vaccine.” Meanwhile, in France, the same AstraZeneca vaccine has caused so many adverse side-effects that the French vaccination task force Conseil d’orientation de la stratégie vaccinale has recommended “a staggering of the vaccination schedule for people working in the same care unit” as well as “the systematic intake of paracetamol just before the injection and in the two following days.”",80% of the nuns in this Kentucky convent got COVID 2 days after vaccine,FALSE

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.  In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.  Hodges says he has no regrets.  He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.  Hodges had worked for the CIA.  Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.  He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.  Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.  He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.  Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.  “We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”  Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate a very powerful sedative that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.  The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.  The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.  This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage?

dca71385,"Sharon Stone smoking in Basic Instinct  Every year, thousands of medical doctors and other members of the “Anti-Smoking Inquisition” spend billions of dollars perpetuating what has unquestionably become the most misleading though successful social engineering scam in history. With the encouragement of most western governments, these Orwellian lobbyists pursue smokers with a fanatical zeal that completely overshadows the ridiculous American alcohol prohibition debacle, which started in 1919 and lasted until 1933.  Nowadays we look back on American prohibition with justifiable astonishment. Is it really true that an entire nation allowed itself to be denied a beer or scotch by a tiny group of tambourine-bashing fanatics? Sadly, yes it is, despite a total lack of evidence that alcohol causes any harm to humans, unless consumed in truly astronomical quantities.  Although there is no direct link between alcohol and tobacco, the history of American prohibition is important, because it helps us understand how a tiny number of zealots managed to control the behavior and lives of tens of millions of people. Nowadays exactly the same thing is happening to smokers at the hands of government zealots and ignorant medical practitioners.  Certain governments know that their past actions are directly responsible for causing most of the lung and skin cancers in the world today, so they go to extreme lengths in trying to deflect responsibility and thus financial liability away from themselves, and onto harmless organic tobacco instead. As we will find later in the report, humble organic tobacco has never hurt anyone, and in certain ways can justifiably claim to provide startling health protection.  Not all governments around the world share the same problem. Japan and Greece have the highest numbers of adult cigarette smokers in the world, but the lowest incidence of lung cancer. In direct contrast to this, America, Australia, Russia, and some South Pacific island groups have the lowest numbers of adult cigarette smokers in the world, but the highest incidence of lung cancer. This is clue number-one in unraveling the absurd but entrenched western medical lie that “smoking causes lung cancer.”  The first European contact with tobacco was in 1492, when Columbus and fellow explorer Rodriguo de Jerez saw natives smoking in Cuba. That very same day, de Jerez took his first puff and found it very relaxing, just as the locals had assured him it would be. This was an important occasion, because Rodriguo de Jerez discovered what the Cubans and native Americans had known for many centuries: that cigar and cigarette smoking is not only relaxing, it also cures coughs and other minor ailments. When he returned home, Rodriguo de Jerez proudly lit a cigar in the street, and was promptly arrested and imprisoned for three years by the horrified Spanish Inquisition. De Jerez thus became the first victim of the anti-smoking lobbies.  In less than a century, smoking became a much enjoyed and accepted social habit throughout Europe, with thousands of tons of tobacco being imported from the colonies to meet the increasing demand. A growing number of writers praised tobacco as a universal remedy for mankind’s ills. By the early 20th Century almost one in every two people smoked, but the incidence of lung cancer remained so low that it was almost immeasurable. Then something extraordinary happened on July 16, 1945: a terrifying cataclysmic event that would eventually cause western governments to distort the perception of smoking forever. As K. Greisen recalls:  “When the intensity of the light had diminished, I put away the glass and looked toward the tower directly. At about this time I noticed a blue color surrounding the smoke cloud. Then someone shouted that we should observe the shock wave travelling along the ground. The appearance of this was a brightly lighted circular area, near the ground, slowly spreading out towards us. The color was yellow.”  “The permanence of the smoke cloud was one thing that surprised me. After the first rapid explosion, the lower part of the cloud seemed to assume a fixed shape and to remain hanging motionless in the air. The upper part meanwhile continued to rise, so that after a few minutes it was at least five miles high. It slowly assumed a zigzag shape because of the changing wind velocity at different altitudes. The smoke had pierced a cloud early in its ascent, and seemed to be completely unaffected by the cloud.”  This was the notorious “Trinity Test”, the first dirty nuclear weapon to be detonated in the atmosphere. A six-kilogram sphere of plutonium, compressed to supercriticality by explosive lenses, Trinity exploded over New Mexico with a force equal to approximately 20,000 tons of TNT. Within seconds, billions of deadly radioactive particles were sucked into the atmosphere to an altitude of six miles, where high-speed jet streams could circulate them far and wide.  The American Government knew about the radiation in advance, was well aware of its lethal effects on humans, but bluntly ordered the test with a complete disregard for health and welfare. In law, this was culpable gross negligence, but the American Government did not care. Sooner or later, one way or the other, they would find another culprit for any long-term effects suffered by Americans and other citizens in local and more remote areas.  If a single microscopic radioactive fallout particle lands on your skin at the beach, you get skin cancer. Inhale a single particle of the same lethal muck, and death from lung cancer becomes inevitable, unless you happen to be an exceptionally lucky cigarette smoker. The solid microscopic radioactive particle buries itself deep in the lung tissue, completely overwhelms the body’s limited reserves of vitamin B17, and causes rampant uncontrollable cell multiplication.  How can we be absolutely sure that radioactive fallout particles really cause lung cancer every time a subject is internally exposed? For real scientists, as opposed to medical quacks and government propagandists, this is not a problem. For any theory to be accepted scientifically, it must first be proven in accordance with rigorous requirements universally agreed by scientists. First the suspect radioactive agent must be isolated, then used in properly controlled laboratory experiments to produce the claimed result, i.e. lung cancer in mammals.  Scientists have ruthlessly sacrificed tens of thousands of mice and rats in this way over the years, deliberately subjecting their lungs to radioactive matter. The documented scientific results of these various experiments are identical. Every mouse or rat obediently contracts lung cancer, and every mouse or rat then dies. Theory has thus been converted to hard scientific fact under tightly controlled laboratory conditions. The suspect agent [radioactive matter] caused the claimed result [lung cancer] when inhaled by mammals.  The overall magnitude of lung cancer risk to humans from atmospheric radioactive fallout cannot be overstated. Before Russia, Britain and America outlawed atmospheric testing on August 5, 1963, more than 4,200 kilograms of plutonium had been discharged into the atmosphere. Because we know that less than one microgram [millionth of a single gram] of inhaled plutonium causes terminal lung cancer in a human, we therefore know that your friendly government has lofted 4,200,000,000 [4.2 Billion] lethal doses into the atmosphere, with particle radioactive half-life a minimum of 50,000 years. Frightening? Unfortunately it gets worse.  The plutonium mentioned above exists in the actual nuclear weapon before detonation, but by far the greatest number of deadly radioactive particles are those derived from common dirt or sand sucked up from the ground, and irradiated while travelling vertically through the weapon’s fireball. These particles form by far the largest part of the “smoke” in any photo of an atmospheric nuclear detonation. In most cases several tons of material are sucked up and permanently irradiated in transit, but let us be incredibly conservative and claim that only 1,000 kilograms of surface material is sucked up by each individual atmospheric nuclear test.  Before being banned by Russia, Britain and America, a total of 711 atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted, thereby creating 711,000 kilograms of deadly microscopic radioactive particles, to which must be added the original 4,200 kilograms from the weapons themselves, for a gross though very conservative total of 715,200 kilograms. There are more than a million lethal doses per kilogram, meaning that your governments have contaminated your atmosphere with more than 715,000,000,000 [715 Billion] such doses, enough to cause lung or skin cancer 117 times in every man, woman and child on earth.  Before you ask, no, the radioactive particles do not just “fade away”, at least not in your lifetime or that of your children and grandchildren. With a half-life of 50,000 years or longer, these countless trillions of deadly government-manufactured radioactive particles are essentially with you forever. Circulated around the world by powerful jet streams, these particles are deposited at random, though in higher concentrations within a couple of thousand miles of the original test sites. A simple wind or other surface disturbance is all that is needed to stir them up again and create enhanced dangers for those in the vicinity.  The once-innocent activity of playfully kicking sand around on the beach in summer could nowadays easily translate to suicide, if you happen to stir up a few radioactive particles that could stick to your skin or be inhaled into your lungs.  Twelve years after the cataclysmic Trinity test, it became obvious to western governments that things were getting completely out of control, with a 1957 British Medical Research Council report stating that global “deaths from lung cancer have more than doubled during the period 1945 to 1955”, though no explanation was offered. During the same ten-year period, cancer deaths in the immediate proximity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki went up threefold. By the end of official atmospheric testing in 1963, the incidence of lung cancer in the Pacific Islands had increased fivefold since 1945. Having screwed your environment completely for 50,000 years, it was time for “big government” to start taking heavy diversionary action.  How could people be proved to be causing themselves to contract lung cancer, i.e. be said to be guilty of a self inflicted injury for which government could never be blamed or sued? The only obvious substance that people inhaled into their lungs, apart from air, was tobacco smoke, so the government boot was put in. Poorly qualified medical “researchers” suddenly found themselves overwhelmed with massive government grants all aimed at achieving the same end-result: “Prove that smoking causes lung cancer”. Real scientists especially some notable nuclear physicists smiled grimly at the early pathetic efforts of the fledgling anti-smoking lobby, and lured them into the deadliest trap of all. The quasi-medical researchers were invited to prove their false claims under exactly the same rigid scientific rules that were used when proving that radioactive particles cause lung cancer in mammals.  Remember, for any theory to be accepted scientifically, it must first be proven in accordance with rigorous requirements universally agreed by scientists. First the suspect agent tobacco smoke must be isolated, then used in properly controlled laboratory experiments to produce the claimed result, i.e. lung cancer in mammals. Despite exposing literally tens of thousands of especially vulnerable mice and rats to the equivalent of 200 cigarettes per day for years on end, “medical science” has never once managed to induce lung cancer in any mouse or rat. Yes, you did read that correctly. For more than forty years, hundreds of thousands of medical doctors have been deliberately lying to you.  The real scientists had the quasi-medical researchers by the throat, because “pairing” the deadly radioactive particle experiment with the benign tobacco smoke experiment, proved conclusively for all time that smoking cannot under any circumstances cause lung cancer. And further, in one large “accidental” experiment they were never allowed to publish, the real scientists proved with startling clarity that smoking actually helps to protect against lung cancer.  All mice and rats are used one-time-only in a specific experiment, and then destroyed. In this way researchers ensure that the results of whatever substance they are testing cannot be accidentally “contaminated” by the real or imagined effects of another substance. Then one day as if by magic, a few thousand mice from the smoking experiment “accidentally” found their way into the radioactive particle experiment, which in the past had killed every single one of its unfortunate test subjects. But this time, completely against the odds, sixty percent of the smoking mice survived exposure to the radioactive particles. The only variable was their prior exposure to copious quantities of tobacco smoke.  Government pressure was immediately brought to bear and the facts suppressed, but this did not completely silence the real scientists. Tongue-in-cheek perhaps, Professor Schrauzer, President of the International Association of Bio-inorganic Chemists, testified before a U.S. congressional committee in 1982 that it had long been well known to scientists that certain constituents of tobacco smoke act as anti-carcinogens anti-cancer agents in test animals. He continued that when known carcinogens cancer-causing substances are applied to the animals, the application of constituents of cigarette smoke counter them.  Nor did Professor Schrauzer stop there. He further testified on oath to the committee that “no ingredient of cigarette smoke has been shown to cause human lung cancer”, adding that “no-one has been able to produce lung cancer in laboratory animals from smoking.” It was a neat answer to a rather perplexing problem. If government blocks publication of your scientific paper, take the alternate route and put the essential facts on the written congressional record!  Predictably, this hard truth drove the government and quasi-medical “researchers” into a frenzy of rage. By 1982 they had actually started to believe their own ridiculous propaganda, and were not to be silenced by eminent members of the scientific establishment. Quite suddenly they switched the blame to other “secret” ingredients put into cigarettes by the tobacco companies. “Yes, that must be it!” they clamored eagerly, until a handful of scientists got on the phone and pointed out that these same “secret” ingredients had been included in the mice experiments, and had therefore also been proved incapable of causing lung cancer.  Things were looking desperate for government and the medical community overall. Since the anti-smoking funding had started in the early sixties, tens of thousands of medical doctors had passed through medical school, where they had been taught that smoking causes lung cancer. Most believed the lie, but cracks were starting to appear in the paintwork. Even the dullest of straight “C” doctors could not really make the data correlate, and when they queried it were told not to ask stupid questions. “Smoking causes lung cancer” converted to a creed, a quasi-religious belief mechanism where blind faith became a substitute for proof.  On the mortuary slab the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker look an identical pink, and the only way a forensic pathologist can tell you might have been a smoker, is if he finds heavy stains of nicotine on your fingers, a packet of Camels or Marlboro in your coat pocket, or if one of your relatives unwisely admits on the record that you once smoked the demon weed. Even blind faith needs a system of positive reinforcement, which in this case became the advertising agencies and the media. Suddenly the television screens were flooded with images of terribly blackened “smoker’s lungs”, with the accompanying mantra that you will die in horrible agony if you don’t quit now. It was all pathetic rubbish of course.and the only way a forensic pathologist can tell you might have been a smoker, is if he finds heavy stains of nicotine on your fingers, a packet of Camels or Marlboro in your coat pocket, or if one of your relatives unwisely admits on the record that you once smoked the demon weed.  The black lungs? From a coal miner, who throughout his working life breathed in copious quantities of microscopic black coal dust particles. Just like radioactive particles they get caught deep in the tissue of the lungs and stay there forever.  Many people ask exactly how it is that those smoking mice were protected from deadly radioactive particles, and even more are asking why real figures nowadays are showing far more non-smokers dying from lung cancer than smokers. Professor Sterling of the Simon Fraser University in Canada is perhaps closest to the truth, where he uses research papers to reason that smoking promotes the formation of a thin mucous layer in the lungs, “which forms a protective layer stopping any cancer-carrying particles from entering the lung tissue.”  This is probably as close as we can get to the truth at present, and it does make perfect scientific sense. Deadly radioactive particles inhaled by a smoker would initially be trapped by the mucous layer, and then be ejected from the body before they could enter the tissue.  All of this may be a bit depressing for non-smokers, but there are probably one or two things you can do to minimize the risks as far as possible. Rather than shy away from smokers in your local pub or club, get as close as you can and breathe in their expensive second-hand smoke. Go on, don’t be shy, suck in a few giant breaths. Or perhaps you could smoke one cigarette or small cigar after each meal, just three a day to build up a thin boundary mucous layer. If you cannot or will not do either of the above, consider getting a surgical mask!  .",SHOCKING REPORT: Smoking May Protect Lungs From Cancer,FALSE

Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.  It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.  But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.  “I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” Robert F. Cathcart, MD  The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:  Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams or more daily, in divided doses.  Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000  Magnesium: 400 mg daily in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form  Zinc: 20 mg daily  Selenium: 100 mcg micrograms daily  Vitamin C [1] , Vitamin D [2] , magnesium [3] , zinc [4] , and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.  The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s. [6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980. [7]  It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

1e83af88,"Based on actual results and accounting for states currently not called, still counting, recounting, under investigation or audit, or states with election issues now in the courts, President Trump is winning the 2020 Presidential Election. Per consideration for all the states still in question, President Trump is currently winning the 2020 election. Here is what we already know. A number of states have been called but a number are still in question. Here is a list of those in question. Pennsylvania – although the current counts show Biden leading there is so much corruption in this state that it is likely that this state will never come to a transparent and agreed upon decision on who wins this state. President Trump was up by 700,000 votes on election night but more than a million ballots were added since that which eventually stole the election for Biden. The President has a clear path to victory once the illegal votes are addressed. TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO Wisconsin – this state as well now shows Biden in the lead but early in the morning after the election more than 100,000 votes magically appeared in Milwaukee. The current lead for Biden is only 20,000. If these votes or the exception in the numbers in Rock County are addressed, Trump will likely win this state by a large margin. Michigan – this state is as well full of fraud. Lawsuits are in place. In addition there were over 100,000 votes dumped in Detroit and the lead here was stolen from Trump as well. Once the illegal votes are eliminated President Trump has a very good chance of winning this state as well. Georgia – this state too has much fraud. The President was winning this state on election night by 100,000 votes. But after the election a program was put in place to basically harvest a number of ballots. Now Biden leads in this state as well. Once the harvested ballots are thrown out, this state will go to Trump as well. Nevada – there is much fraud here as well. Signatures were not verified on hundreds of thousands of votes. It is likely that President Trump will win this state if any of the ineligible votes are eliminated here as well.

5d7d6af3,"There has been a fiery debate over the past few weeks about illegal aliens and crime, which has intensified with the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco by a seven-time felon and five-time deportee as the direct result of the city’s sanctuary policy.  What seems to have been overlooked in the back and forth on this is some of the very disturbing, actual data on crimes committed by illegal aliens, which should concern every American—particularly those who live in sanctuary cities like New Orleans or San Francisco that release criminal aliens rather than turning them over to the Department of Homeland Security.  As Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Study outlines, Department of Homeland Security records show that in just one eight-month period in 2014, more than 8,100 deportable aliens were released by sanctuary jurisdictions. Three thousand of them were felons and 62 percent had a prior criminal record. Nineteen hundred were later rearrested a total of 4,300 times on 7,500 different offenses.  Thus, these sanctuary policies directly victimized thousands of the residents of these sanctuary cities who were subjected to assaults, burglaries, sexual assaults, thefts and even murders that would not have occurred except for these sanctuary policies.  But there is more. In 2005, at the request of several members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office prepared two reports on criminal aliens—legal and illegal—in prison for committing crimes in the United States. Those reports are very revealing. For example, the first report GAO-05-337R released on April 7, 2005, found that:  The percentage of federal prisoners who are criminal aliens is about 27 percent;  In 2004, there were 49,000 such prisoners in federal jails;  In 2002, the federal government gave reimbursements to the 50 states under the “State Criminal Alien Assistance Program” SCAAP for incarcerating another 77,000 illegal aliens in state prisons; and  At the local level in 2002, the federal government reimbursed 750 local governments under SCAAP for incarcerating an additional 138,000 criminal illegal aliens, which jumped to 147,000 prisoners in 2003.  It is important to note that these reported numbers “represent only a portion of the total population of criminal aliens who may be incarcerated at the local level,” since the federal government does “not reimburse localities for all criminal aliens” and some states don’t submit requests for reimbursement. So where were all of these criminal aliens from? According to the GAO report, the breakdown was as follows:  Federal prisons: Mexico 63 percent; Colombia 7 percent; the Dominican Republic 7 percent; Jamaica 4 percent; Cuba 3 percent; El Salvador 2 percent; Honduras, Haiti and Guatemala each 1 percent, and the remaining 11 percent from 164 other countries.  State prisons: In the five states Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas incarcerating about 80 percent of SCAAP criminal aliens, the prisoners were from Mexico 58 percent; Cuba 5 percent; Dominican Republic 5 percent; El Salvador 4 percent; Jamaica 3 percent; Vietnam 2 percent; and the remaining 22 percent from 148 other countries.  Local jails: In the five local jails with the largest criminal illegal alien populations, the prisoners were from Mexico 65 percent; El Salvador 6 percent; Guatemala 3 percent; Honduras 2 percent; South Korea, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines each 1 percent; and the remaining 20 percent from 193 other countries.  Thus, it is clear that criminal aliens already represent more than a quarter of all of the prisoners in federal prisons and are present in large numbers in state and local jails.  The second GAO report GAO-05-646R, released on May 9, 2005, looked at the crimes committed by 55,322 aliens who “had entered the country illegally and were still illegally in the country at the time of their incarceration in federal or state prison or local jail during fiscal year 2003.”  The path of destruction weaved by these 55,322 illegal aliens was truly shocking. According to GAO, these criminal aliens:  Were arrested a total of 459,614 times, averaging about eight arrests per illegal alien;  97 percent had more than one arrest, while 26 percent had over 11 arrests;  Committed almost 700,000 criminal offenses, averaging 13 offenses per illegal alien;  10 percent of these illegal aliens were arrested for committing 26 or more offenses;  Out of all of the arrests, 12 percent were for violent crimes such as murder, robbery, assault and sex-related crimes; 15 percent were for burglary, larceny, theft and property damage; 24 percent were for drug offenses; and the remaining offenses were for DUI, fraud, forgery, counterfeiting, weapons, immigration and obstruction of justice; and  80 percent of the arrests occurred in just three states: California, Texas, and Arizona  Of course, these statistics reflect the criminal histories of aliens who were in prison. Unfortunately, in fiscal year 2013, the Obama administration released over 36,000 convicted criminal aliens awaiting the outcome of deportation hearings upon an unsuspecting public, and another 30,558 in fiscal year 2014 according to the House Judiciary Committee.  The offenses for which they were convicted involved “dangerous drugs, assault and domestic violence, stolen vehicles, robbery, sex offenses, sexual assault, kidnaping, voluntary manslaughter, and even homicide.” As the House Judiciary Committee outlined, more than a quarter of these aliens “were so called ‘level 1s’ according to the administration—the worst of the worst.” And in 2013 alone, the administration didn’t even bring removal proceedings against an additional 68,000 criminal aliens convicted of everything from homicide to sexual assault.  If the over 134,000 aliens released by the administration in just the past two years follow the pattern of those aliens studied by the GAO in 2005, they will commit hundreds of thousands of more crimes, victimizing countless innocent Americans in crimes that could have been prevented.  How many Americans have to be assaulted, injured, raped or killed, or have their homes, cars and personal property burglarized, stolen or damaged before both the federal government and local governments like San Francisco will finally do what is necessary to lock up criminal aliens who are a danger to the safety and lives of the public?",Sanctuary Policies Have Led to Thousands of Crimes,partially false
42ca71d1,"OPINION | This article contains political commentary which reflects the author's opinion.  Correction Notice: This article previously stated that Kamala Harris said she believes Biden’s “rape accusers.” Following a fact-check from LeadStories as well as a correction in The Federalist, there is a distinction drawn between accusations of “sexual assault” and “rape” compared to accusations of “unwanted touching.” We have issued a correction notice to clarify this issue and we regret this mistake.  According to The Hill as well as The Federalist and several other outlets, Kamala Harris said last year that she believes the women who accused Biden of unwanted touching that made them feel uncomfortable.  “I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris said in 2019.  Several women have accused Biden of unwanted touching, which includes Amy Lappos, Caitlyn Caruso, D. J. Hill, and former Democratic state lawmaker Lucy Flores.  Flores wrote a story in “The Cut” about how Biden put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair from behind, and “proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.”  Harris has been criticized as a hypocrite for supporting Biden over Reade, given her past criticisms of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  From The Hill:  The California senator added that Biden will need to decide for himself whether to run for president. “He’s going to have to make that decision for himself. I wouldn’t tell him what to do,” Harris said. In recent days, several women have come forward to allege that Biden has touched them inappropriately. Former Nevada state lawmaker Lucy Flores, a Democrat, made the first accusation last week in an essay in New York magazine’s The Cut. On Monday, Amy Lappos told the Hartford Courant that Biden also touched her inappropriately at a 2009 fundraiser in Connecticut. Two additional women, Caitlyn Caruso and D. J. Hill, came forward Tuesday, sharing their experiences with The New York Times. — Advertisement — Biden, who is considering running for president and has led a number of polls of Democrats, has not commented publicly on the accusations since Sunday, when in response to Flores’s allegation he said in a statement that he has “offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort.” “And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,” Biden added. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully.”  Lappos alleged that Biden “put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me…I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.”  Caruso added that Biden put his hand on her thigh and hugged her “just a bit too long.”  The Hill reported that Biden moved his hand down Caruso’s back during a photo op.  Tara Reade also made headlines for accusing Biden of sexually assaulting her while she worked in his U.S. Senate office in 1993.",BOMBSHELL: Interview Surfaces Of Kamala Harris Saying She Believes Biden’s Accusers [Opinion],FALSE

Viewers were especially angry after the network called Arizona for Biden long before all of the votes in that state were cast.  From Breitbart:  The backlash had been brewing for a while but really took off after Chris Wallace’s dreadful and dreadfully biased and dishonest role as moderator in the first presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden.  The backlash then went nuclear after Fox News maliciously and erroneously called Arizona for Joe Biden on Tuesday night — a state that is still too close to call. Fox News has stunk for years, but over the past few months it’s gone beyond stinking to out-and-out betrayal of its loyal viewers, especially with its presidential polls that are not simply incorrect, they are bald-faced lies.

And your conspiracy theories about Facebook, are more true than you realize.  I worked for a company named Appen. We are a 3rd party freelance contract company. A few years ago Facebook approached us with an offer. Zuckerburg couldn't legally censor people on his platform because he told congress that he was an open forum. So, he uses several 3rd party companies to Fact Check, and otherwise censor, information.  Justin Trudeau has been taking action in Canada, China, and America, to prepare us for the Great Reset, and by us, I refer to civilians. Part of this process is to work with Zuckerburg and Dorsey to restrict the flow of information, and to push the statutes of the Reset into peoples minds: repetition is the key here.  We coordinate our efforts with a company in India, from our base in Canada, to provide our censorship services to Facebook. A lot of this information, you probably already guessed. But here's what you might not have known  We have specific directives on what to fact check and how to fact check. I'm going to list off a couple of these directives:  1 First off, primarily conservative and right leaning posts on Twitter and Facebook make it to our service.  2 Left leaning posts are to be ignored and never manually flagged, it doesn’t matter if it violates TOS or even federal law. If Facebook gets in trouble they blame us, and they can't do anything because we're not based in America, so we give the government the run around and nothing can be done. It's worked so far.  3 Zuckerburg created a program that feeds posts automatically into our service, it analyzes content in posts, searching for common images and lines of text, and if it matches any of our guidelines it gets automatically flagged and entered into our system to be Fact Checked. So we don't just go looking for conservative posts, Zuckerburg sends them to us with his automatic program.  4If there are multiple ideas in a conservative post, only 1 of them needs to be potentially disputable. We are to flag an entire article as disputed/false/discredited/untrue/etc even if theres only 1 idea thats not completely confirmed.  5 Even ideas that are confirmed, don't matter unless its a left leaning idea. What this translates to is as long as we all push the same idea, what we say becomes truth. That's standard psychology, and American's are the easiest to manipulate with this. The only thing making it difficult is their Freedoms that are not common in most countries around the world, which forces us to deal with America in a different way.  6When we write articles for Politico, NYT, etc we are allowed to mark a title or article as true as long as at least 3 of the core ideas in the article or post are potentially true. Keyword here is potentially, it can be completely false, but as long as we can cite a source that argues in our favor, we can confirm it 100% true. The inverse is also true, if we can find even 1 source that dictates something to be potentially false, we can mark the entire article/post.  7 We write articles, and then cite our own articles as evidence. Check the fine print of each article, we always cite ourselves, but what you might not know, is that only a handful of companies are actually writing the articles for dozens of websites, news media, and mass media. This isn't unique to America, we've done this in countries around the world for a very long time.  8  We only allow members to join us if they pass a test, this test is an opinion based survey, however, they must answer all left leaning, or they are not allowed to join, we wont be diluted.  9 This part I cannot confirm, but I am suspicious that China has more to do with this than just their involvement with Canada, but again, I can't confirm that, thats just my personal theory because we're not allowed to say anything negative in our business chats about China's government.  10 This is all preparation for the Great Reset, by getting Trump out, because he opposed the idea. Biden has agreed to go full on into it, which is why he's been getting such a big hand from Facebook and Twitter, however, it's much bigger than just that. In our new world order, we'll control not just national news, but global news. By controlling the global narrative, we control what information you're allowed to know and what you're allowed to think.  11 There are contingencies in place, Trump cannot win. We have members of Congress who are part of this, and soon the President and VP.  12 If a Civil War breaks out, it will be according to our plan. We hope for it, and we tried to use Race to spark it in America, if that doesn’t work, ISIS is on stand by for when Biden is in office. This was determined along time ago, or so i'm told.  13 I no longer work for this company. I registered with them using a fake identity.  #Greatreset #covid",Facebook Fact Checkers?

ecc6b873,"Throughout the election, Donald Trump was battered by CCP Virus statistics in order to hurt the American economy and his political campaign. We know that it was shamelessly wielded as a political weapon to prevent President Trump and his supporters from rallying as Antifa and Black Lives Matter burned progressive poor and minority neighborhoods to the ground throughout the entire year. Now that Biden has been installed into the office of president, he promises to increase Covid lockdown measures and extend them further into your ability to travel and force unscientific mask-wearing for at least 100 days. But, a new peer reviewed study has been released that finds the CDC numbers to be so wildly unsupported as to be pure propaganda that is based on wholly unscientific practices that were needlessly created on-the-spot. The National File Reports “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE. CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson.” The study is 25 pages long with over 100 citations. However, the main main points can be summarized. A major point is that testing inaccuracies and unreliability combined with unscientific procedures and methods resulted in demonstrably massive false-positive spikes: “The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine.” There are also profound legal implications raised by the study that need to be dealt with in courts around the country if America is to ever be free again. The data you have been spoonfed by the CDC for a year raises serious legal issues. Much like the 2020 election, massive changes in rules for reporting and collecting data were instituted exclusively for Covid which resulted in a 1600% inflated number of fatalities: “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study. “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.” But that is not all. Other major Covid collection and reporting standards created on March 24th of 2020 that inexplicably and intentionally changed decades old practices in order to hide comorbidities and preexisting health conditions on death reports. These underlying health conditions may likely have been the actual or most important cause of death: “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens. And, still, there is MORE! Last spring the CDC created covid-19-exclusive rules that violated federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development and wrote new rules to count probable cases without any definitive proof of infection. The new rules also allowed tracers to practice medicine without a license while disallowing any measures to be put in place to prevent a patient from being counted multiple times: “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists CSTE, a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5, new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license section VII.A3 – page 5, and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case section VII.B – page 7,” stated All Concerned Citizens. Why would those in power wish to do such inhumane things to the entire population of America? The National File concludes: “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME, to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.” There is much more to the report, and we suggest that you read it at the link provided in the beginning of this article. All data since last year suggest that Covid-19 hysteria is part of an orchestrated coup against Western values, nations, and laws. At what point will the evidence and data be enough to break the spell cast on millions of Americans by the Covid Cult? Please, bring this report to your local officials and insist that they read it and reverse the policies being implemented and ramped up across the country or America is surely dead.","CDC Exposed: Inflated Covid Deaths By 1600% Throughout The Election, “Violated Multiple Federal Laws” Peer-Reviewed Study Finds...State, Local Governments Must Act",FALSE

01ed1b22,"Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.      Newt Gingrich, one of Donald Trump’s top surrogates and a possible Cabinet pick for the Republican president-elect, does not believe that Trump, who lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, won the presidency within a fully fair and representative electoral system.  That is, if Gingrich’s words from two years ago can be taken seriously.  As has been widely noted on the internet, Trump four years ago questioned the legitimacy of the Electoral College system, which selects presidents based on the states they win rather than the total votes they receive. On Election Day 2012, when there was public speculation that Mitt Romney might win the popular vote but lose in the Electoral College to President Barack Obama, Trump went on a tweet storm, calling the election “a total sham and a travesty.” He exclaimed, “We are not a democracy.” He called for “revolution” against this “great and disgusting injustice” and slammed the “phoney electoral college.” In April, Ben Carson also questioned the need for the Electoral College.  Now add Gingrich to the list of Trumpsters who question the legitimacy of the system that handed Trump the presidency.  In 2014, Gingrich sent a letter to National Popular Vote, a nonpartisan group that promotes legislation that would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes nationally. According to its website, 11 states have passed legislation that would hand their electoral votes to the popular-vote winner if enough states do the same. The measure has been approved in one chamber in an additional 12 states. The organizers of this initiative advocate the reform mainly because the current system compels candidates to devote time and resources only to swing states, meaning that Americans in other states and their specific issues are largely ignored. This campaign has not received tremendous attention, but two years ago Gingrich jumped on board.  In his letter to the organization, Gingrich endorsed its proposal. He wrote, “This important project has the potential to transform the way we elect our presidents and to make sure all Americans have a voice in their future.” Gingrich explained:  We are a country of 314 million people, the most diverse nation on Earth. This is one of our greatest strengths, and it means our president must be the president of an enormously complex and varied country…Unfortunately, the current system for electing presidents does not reflect this tremendous diversity. The winner-take-all-method of allotting electoral votes means candidates must focus their efforts on just a handful of closely divided states.  Gingrich added, “America would be better served with a presidential election process that treated citizens across the country equally.” Picking a president by the national popular vote, he asserted, would be in sync with “fundamental democratic principles.”  That was then. This is now. The most current vote counts show Clinton leading Trump, 60 million votes to 59.8 million votes, a spread of one-fifth of a percentage point. That means more Americans wanted her to be president. But don’t expect Gingrich—or Trump—to question the fairness of a process that is now putting one of the most divisive major-party candidates into the White House. All their previous talk about fairness and the popular vote is no longer operative. But Trump’s 2012 observation still stands: The United States may be a republic, but, in pure terms, it is not a democracy.","Before This Election, Newt Gingrich Believed the Popular Vote Winner Should Be President – Mother Jones",TRUE

34b5c124,"The California flag, beloved by millions, proudly adorning t-shirts up and down the coast and hung on the dorm room walls of homesick Californian students nationwide, has to go.  That’s the message of a Los Angeles Times op-ed by writer Alex Abella, who calls the Bear Flag “a symbol of blatant illegality and racial prejudice,” hoisted by a rebel band of “slave owners, murderers, thieves, drunks and squatters.” Abella does not suggest an alternative with which the flag should be replaced.  In Abella’s retelling of the story, California under Mexican rule was a relative paradise, with “a democratic government, paternalistic and often beset by political conflicts, yet multi-ethnic and racially integrated.” The new American regime “denied civil rights to blacks and Indians,” and set about exterminating the state’s indigenous population, stealing land and livestock, imposing an alien system of laws rather than the existing system set up under the Spanish-speaking Californios.  Most Californians have a different view. The liberal public radio station KPCC posted a story in 2012 about the origins of the bear on the flag, with the introduction: “We might be biased–but California has one of the best state flags, no? The bold star on the left, the green patch of land… and–of course–the California grizzly bear, our state animal, forever trudging along.”  According to snopes.com, the inclusion of a bear in the flag was a mistake; it was supposed to be a pear.

The judge has imposed a “media blackout”, but Canadian outlets like Conservative Beaver are not subject to those rules. Other Canadian and Spanish-language outlets have already reported on this development.  “The trail of Chinese espionage is long and, sadly, strewn with former American intelligence officers who betrayed their colleagues, their country and its liberal democratic values to support an authoritarian communist regime,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. “This betrayal is never worth it. Whether immediately, or many years after they thought they got away with it, we will find these traitors and we will bring them to justice. To the Chinese intelligence services, these individuals are expendable. To us, they are sad but urgent reminders of the need to stay vigilant.”  “The charges announced today are a sobering reminder to our communities in Hawaii of the constant threat posed by those who seek to jeopardize our nation’s security through acts of espionage,” said U.S. Attorney Price. “Of particular concern are the criminal acts of those who served in our nation’s intelligence community, but then choose to betray their former colleagues and the nation-at large by divulging classified national defense information to China. My office will continue to tenaciously pursue espionage cases.”  Read more breaking news  “This serious act of espionage is another example in a long string of illicit activities that the?People’s Republic of China is conducting within and against the United States,” said Alan E. Kohler Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division. “This case demonstrates that no matter the length or difficulty of the investigation, the men and women of the FBI will work tirelessly to protect our national security from the threat posed by Chinese intelligence services. Let it be known that anyone who violates a position of trust to betray the United States will face justice, no matter how many years it takes to bring their crimes to light.”  “These cases are very complicated and take years if not decades to bring to a conclusion,” said Eli Miranda, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Honolulu Division. “I could not be more proud of the work done by the men and women of the FBI’s Honolulu Division in pursuing this case. Their dedication is a reminder that the FBI will never waiver when it comes to ensuring the safety and security of our nation.”  Obama’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

ca2ff44e,"One in three people with dementia who pay for their own care have to sell their home, an exclusive poll reveals today.  Eight in ten people think politicians have failed to tackle the social care crisis, the survey found, and two-thirds believe the current system – which denies funding to anyone who owns a home or has £23,250 in savings – is unfair. Eight in ten also said the NHS should fund dementia support.  The Daily Mail is campaigning for ministers to end the dementia care cost betrayal, with support flooding in from readers, charities, doctors and MPs.  As pressure mounted on politicians to deliver reform:  Experts last night called on Boris Johnson to match Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt’s promise to act;  Former home secretary David Blunkett, writing in today’s newspaper, admitted Labour failed to take action while in power;  Readers continued to write in with heartbreaking stories of the unfair tax on dementia.  Labour MP Clive Betts, chairman of the local government select committee, said: ‘This poll shows how unfair the whole system is.  ‘If you are an older person who has a heart attack, your medical care is paid for.  ‘But if you get dementia, and own your own home and need care, you have to pay for that care yourself and many have to sell their house to do so. It is completely unacceptable and it needs to be brought to an end.’  Experts called on Boris Johnson to match Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt’s promise to act  Sally Copley, of the Alzheimer’s Society, which has led support for the Mail’s campaign, said: ‘No-one should be forced to sell a home they have worked their whole lives for just because they develop one health condition and not another. This cruel lottery has to end.  ‘The next prime minister must release plans of how he will find a sustainable funding solution for the social care system in the long term, which doesn’t rely on the houses of people with dementia to pay for it.’  The poll of 1,013 adults, carried out by Survation on behalf of the Mail, lays bare the impact on families.  Some 26 per cent of respondents said a member of their family or a friend had been diagnosed with dementia. Of those, 52 per cent said they had to pay for their care, of which an alarming 31 per cent had to sell their home to do so.  Some 27 per cent said they had spent more than £50,000 on care and 6 per cent said the bill had exceeded an astonishing £100,000. Nearly seven in ten of respondents said they would support cutting foreign aid to better fund social care. A third said they would back a small increase in income tax or national insurance.  Boris Johnson arrives at an address in Westminster  The Mail is calling for the urgent formation of a cross-party group to tackle the funding crisis – tasked with dealing with the issue once and for all.  In the meantime, the Government must set up a ‘dementia fund’ to help families pay the extra cost of supporting those affected. And it must end the ‘double subsidy’ which sees those deemed able to afford to pay for care subsidising the costs of support for those funded by the state.  Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘It’s fantastic to see the Daily Mail taking up the cudgels on behalf of the hundreds of thousands who are losing out massively because of the Government’s failure to act on social care. The current system is not only incredibly stingy, it is grossly underfunded too, so some people are struggling to get even their meagre rights recognised and their needs met.  ‘Our new prime minister should firstly put out the fire which threatens social care today, and then get good people around him to help build something better, fairer and more fire-proof.’  Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘We are pleased to see this campaign directly tackling some of the barriers for patients with dementia. We hope it goes some way to finally addressing what has long been an unacceptable situation in England.’  Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on dementia, said: ‘People with dementia are faced with higher costs for their care, costing an average 15 per cent more than if they had standard social care. Social care is in crisis and it leaves people with dementia and their families struggling within a broken and unfair system.  ‘The injustice of people battling to get care, on top of battling the devastating effects of dementia can’t go on.’ The Department of Health and Social Care said: ‘People who need social care should not have to pay more than they can reasonably afford and we introduced reforms aimed at preventing people being forced to sell their homes to pay for their own care in their lifetime.  ‘We will set out our plans to reform the system at the earliest opportunity to protect people from high and unpredictable costs.’  'Mum worked all her life. She paid taxes. Then her home was sold to pay for her care – and subsidise those who didn’t save. It’s so very unfair, I despair'  It’s just days since we launched our campaign to reform dementia care and we’ve been inundated with your heart-breaking letters about how you’ve had to sell prized family homes to pay for the care of loved ones, while those who have never saved have had their care paid for by the state. Here are a selection of your anguished accounts — and write to us at dementiacare@dailymail.co.uk to tell us your own story...  When my late mother, Peggy, was diagnosed with dementia, I couldn’t look after her as I already had to care at home for my husband, Jim, who had Alzheimer’s.  Sadly, she had to go into residential care, selling her lovely home in the Cotswolds in 2005 for £176,000 to pay for the costs.  After nine years in a home, all that money, as well as her pension, was eventually spent on her care — a total of approximately £220,000.  She died in 2015, having used up her entire savings on helping subsidise others funded by the local authority at reduced rates.  Penalised: Ann Reid centre with her mother Peggy left and father Bryan  Pictured: Ann Reid's parents in happier days  It is clear to everyone who has watched a loved-one battle with dementia that there simply isn’t enough money being spent on funding care.  It’s completely unfair that people can work hard all their lives and save up for a home — often by not going on holidays — and be penalised for it if they are diagnosed with dementia.  Paying thousands every year isn’t even a guarantee of good care. In 2008, I remember going to visit my mother and found a nasty note left by a nurse, telling her not to bang on the table.  I was absolutely disgusted, and there’s no sign that our care system is improving.  The only way we are going to fix the dementia care crisis is if our Government puts it at the top of its agenda.  Ever since my mother was diagnosed, politicians have made countless promises about how things are going to get better. But time after time, their words have proved meaningless.  One can only despair.  ANN REID, Eastbourne, East Sussex.  AFTER A LIFE OF HARD WORK  When my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2015, she was initially cared for by her husband, my stepfather.  But after he died a year later, her dementia became worse and we had to move her into residential care. To fund the £986 per week costs, we had to sell Mum’s bungalow — and spend all of her savings. To this day, we have spent £118,800 on Mum’s care.  She worked hard throughout her life. Why was she left to fend for herself after a life-time of paying taxes and National Insurance?  SUE MORRISSEY, Brighton, East Sussex.  The Mail’s articles and letters about those suffering have brought back painful memories of my mother and my mother-in-law, who were both diagnosed with this dreadful illness. Successive governments have — and are still — shirking their responsibilities to solve the current crisis. There are those who say the current situation is a time-bomb.  But that bomb has already exploded and nothing is being done to clear up the mess.  TREVOR HAYES, Knaresborough, N. Yorks.  I feel ashamed  My wife has vascular dementia and to get help we have suffered the insult of the local council carrying out a means-test on our finances.  I left school at 15 and started work, before being called up to do National Service aged 18. Afterwards, I worked all my life, paying every due required.  I finally saved enough to buy my house, only for it to be taken from me to fund my wife’s care. Meanwhile, those who saved nothing get financial assistance. I am now 83 and feel ashamed with the way we are being treated — especially since I’ve spent my life helping make this country the place it is.  A. ROBERTS, Chelmsford, Essex.  Selling mum's home  My mother was diagnosed with vascular dementia about four years ago.  For the next two years, my sister and I tried to support her at home but after she nearly burnt the house down we decided she was safer in a residential home.  Now, after paying £80,000 in costs, we have had to sell the family home to fund her care.  Our parents worked hard all of their lives, saving and investing, believing they were leaving a legacy to their children.  Instead their money is being used to subsidise other people’s treatment.  LES HITCH, Ware, Hertfordshire.  Our vanishing savings  My husband was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2010. I managed to look after him until my own health deteriorated, when our family persuaded me to put him into care.  He is now 92 and remarkably fit. He no longer recognises me but appears to be contented.  Meanwhile, his £957 per week costs mean our savings are rapidly vanishing.  RHODA MILLAR, Leamington Spa, Warks.  My uncle Felix spent the last two years of his life suffering from dementia in a nursing home in Newry, Northern Ireland. He had worked all his life as a farmer, remained a bachelor and had hoped to pass on his four farms to his brother and sister.  But in 2017, his health deteriorated and he had to go into residential care. To pay for his care, his house and farms were rented out.  By the time he passed away after 17 months in May 2018, we had spent over £50,000 on his care.  PATRICIA O’HARE, Northern Ireland.  And you also expressed your fury...  Almost every family will, at some time, have someone suffering from dementia. Why can’t we maintain just half the foreign aid budget and plough the rest into dementia research?  D. Marks, Featherstone, W. Yorks.  A CARE FUND NEEDED  Everyone earning over a certain amount should have to pay in to a designated dementia care fund, with graduated payments based on their level of income.  J. SAYERS, Hastings, East Sussex.  It is about time the Government ring-fenced part of our taxes and spent it solely on dementia care.  MAIR KENNEDY, address supplied  My biggest worry  I am 75. I left school at 15, as many did in the Fifties and Sixties. Since then, I have worked every day in various forms of employment. I finally retired at 70. Now, I worry that everything I have saved could be spent on care.  ALAN HARMER, address supplied.  I left school when I was 16 and joined the Royal Navy, where I served for seven years.  After meeting the girl of my dreams, we got married and bought a house.  I’m now 83, living on my pension after my wife died last year. If I develop dementia, I will have to sell my home to fund my care. Why did I bother to strive all those years? Why did I bother to be self-sufficient?  ALAN JACOBS, Biddenham, Bedfordshire.  Cross the border!  As the Royal Commission’s recommendation for free care was rejected by the Government in 2000 but adopted in Scotland, I suggest we should take people suffering from dementia over the border.  After all, Scotland costs all of us through our taxes for this preferential treatment of their suffering old people.  Susan Middleton, Keighley, West Yorkshire.  The wrong priorities  The dementia care scandal simply shows that the majority of our politicians are happier splashing billions of our cash on foreign aid than looking after our own.  B. EKINS, Chessington, Surrey.  Hospitals treat for free those people who have smoked or consume copious amounts of alcohol. I have done neither. In fact, I have cost the NHS nothing to treat illnesses that could justifiably be regarded as, at least in part, self-inflicted.  But I do have one condition I have been unable to control.  I am ageing.  Should I have the temerity to develop dementia, I shall be judged so responsible for the illness that I shall be expected to fund my own treatment.  How does that make any sort of sense?  SUSAN YOUNG, Coulsdon, Surrey.  What’s terrible is the effect this dementia tax is having on working-class families.  Those who have scrimped and saved on meagre wages to pay off mortgages throughout their lives, but were still lucky enough to have saved something towards their retirement, are having it guzzled up by this utterly unfair system.  J. HAGUE, Wakefield, West Yorkshire.  Isn’t it amazing that the Government can pay for dementia care for people who have never contributed towards the National Health Service, and make the people who have contributed to the system all their working lives pick up the bill?  G. BRENNAN, Birmingham.  Profligate politicians  If we reined in the excesses of and the likes of profligate politicians and the Department for International Development, perhaps we could start to look after our own.  COLIN WILLIAMS, Devon.  As well as sorting out the disparity in what people pay for dementia care, we also need to ask why care homes have become so expensive.  It’s a scandal.  CASPER GORNIOK, Surrey.  It terrified me  I am in my late 60s and the thought of being diagnosed with dementia and losing everything I have worked for fills me with terror.  WILLIAM ROSS, address supplied.  Why should a person who has been frugal be worse off than someone who hasn’t, despite both having paid into the same system?  Dementia care funding is completely unfair and needs a thorough overhaul so that all are treated the same.  KEITH MARTIN,  New Milton, Hampshire  Diagnosed at just 58, I fear I’ll lose all I’ve worked for...  By Wendy Mitchell  Can you imagine being diagnosed with young-onset dementia at the age of 58?  The debilitating mental effects of the disease are well-documented, and the stress of living with it is hard enough for anyone.  But for people with young-onset dementia, you don’t just fear losing your memories. You fear losing your future.  I would know — for five years ago, at just 58, I received my diagnosis.  Now, as my condition accelerates, I fear that the future I had once mapped out for myself is a mere pipe dream.  For years, I was encouraged by successive governments to save my money wisely. I didn’t smoke, didn’t drink, and always counted my pennies when they came.  Despairing: Wendy Mitchell, who worked as an NHS hospital manager, at home in Yorkshire  One day, I was told I would even be a homeowner.  And if I had a bit left over, perhaps I could leave it to my daughters.  But now, thanks to the current dementia care system’s insistence that people like me need to spend almost all our savings on care, I often ask myself: ‘Why did I bother?’  For everything that I worked hard for, including my house, will one day have to pay for care costs; care that’s often inadequate and degrading.  That’s my future... This is my life.  I spent 20 years working as an NHS hospital manager in Yorkshire. But when I’ll need the NHS most, it won’t be there for me.  Only a wealthy minority can afford the luxury of well-staffed, well-supported homes. Even if I sold my house, the sum I would get would only keep me in a good, reputable care home for a while.  Then what? Will I be carted off to a dusty corner somewhere?  When it comes to people with dementia, the Government has made it clear that we are not a priority.  It’s more than happy to cause distress and financial hardship for those caring for loved ones, just to save a few million pounds. Yet the trauma experienced by hard-working families is costing lives.  We have known for decades that our ageing population is constantly increasing. So why have consecutive governments failed to address this social care problem?  If I had been diagnosed with cancer, I would have had an automatic right to free care up until my death.  Why should I be punished financially for having dementia? Why should I have to sell my house to cover care costs, when other conditions are supported? Is dementia really less worthy?  The much-needed Green Paper on social care was finally promised back in April, after a two-year delay. Yet our current Government has delayed it six times. Six!  That review was supposed to bring us hope. But in its place, pain, frustration and financial ruin have run rampant.  This is a disgrace. We should all hang our heads in shame.  Wendy Mitchell is the author of Somebody I Used To Know.  Scandal of my sister embarrasses us all  By Lord Blunkett  David Blunkett's half-sister, Doreen, who had Dementia  Just over ten years ago, I received a note from then Labour Health Secretary Alan Johnson kindly asking if I would attend the launch of his ground-breaking plan to resolve the dementia care crisis.  He knew I was an ardent critic of what was then the care system, which hung dementia patients out to dry, and that I would support his demand for a £150 million pot from the Treasury which could be used to boost dementia services.  It was an admirable demand — one that, in 2009, we felt was long overdue.If you had told me then that our rotting dementia care system would remain untreated, I would have laughed you out of the room.  Even in the late Seventies, when I chaired the social services committee of Sheffield City Council, we were aware our country’s dementia care system was woefully inadequate.  At Johnson’s policy launch, he asked me to speak but, thanks to some mix up, mistakenly introduced me as the vice-president of the Alzheimer’s Society. It turned out to be a fortunate error, however, as afterwards the organisation’s chief executive actually sought me out and offered me the role. I was thrilled.  But Alzheimer’s soon came to play a different role in my life.  For little did I know at the time that my half-sister, Doreen, who died last year, was on the verge of developing dementia. Her diagnosis hammered home the debilitating impact that this disease can have on an individual with it, as well as their family.  Just imagine being told you have dementia, realising why boiling a kettle, or using a cash machine, has been posing a challenge it never did before; why the words that once sprung to mind so easily now suddenly elude you.  Doreen's diagnosis hammered home the debilitating impact that this disease can have on an individual with it, as well as their family pictured: David Blunkett, 2005  Then comes the second, equally frustrating blow: you are told that despite having a life-changing condition — despite the fact that you have paid taxes all your life — the NHS won’t cover your social care.  And so for many families, a diagnosis of dementia is often accompanied by financial punishment.  This is what most terrified Doreen and her husband, Jack, who was physically ill before her condition deteriorated.  Rather than go into residential care, and risk having to spend all their savings and sell their house to pay for it, they coped with care at home for as long as possible.  Eventually, Jack’s deteriorating health meant they could no longer manage, and in 2015 they moved into residential care.  Jack died shortly after, but Doreen spent almost four years in care, which forced the sale of their modest home — an asset which for so many like her is their whole life savings. Dementia is, and has long been, a most discriminated-against condition, which is why the Mail’s campaign is so important.  Pictured: Lord Blunkett with guide dog Cosby  While the NHS provides free treatment for those diagnosed with heart disease or cancer — and rightly so — people with dementia are left at the mercy of a broken social care system. The absence of financial support for every person with dementia should embarrass us all.  As the countless tragic cases highlighted by this paper have revealed, people are having to sell their family homes and use life savings just to pay for their basic care. And it’s not just people with dementia paying the price — the NHS is, too.  According to Alzheimer’s Society research, in just one year more than 70,000 people with dementia were forced to go to A&E because inadequate or scarce social care left them unprotected from avoidable emergencies such as falls, infections and dehydration — at an estimated cost to the NHS of £400 million.  If we want to remedy the betrayal of dementia patients, we must act now. For although the past 20 years has been filled with political promises, successive governments have failed to take much-needed action.  As soon as he was elected in 1997, Tony Blair claimed that he did not want ‘children to be brought up in a country where the only way pensioners can get long-term care is by selling their home’.  A Royal Commission was convened, but its recommendation for free long-term personal care was rejected a year later.  And when Alan Johnson — whose support for a ‘National Care Service’ was also taken up by his immediate successor Andy Burnham — tried to revolutionise social care, Labour’s defeat in the election a year later meant their proposals were also shelved.  In the years since, from the Dilnot review’s proposals in 2011 for a cap on care payments to Theresa May’s call in the last election for the current asset level of £23,250 — above which patients must fund themselves — to be raised, every attempt to improve our care system has fallen on deaf ears.  The 850,000 people in the UK living with dementia deserve better. Rather than delay the current Green Paper on social care for a seventh time in two years, our Government must finally commit to long-term social care reform and find a way to sustainably fund dementia care for the future.  There is no other choice.  By 2021, one million people in the UK will have dementia, and they will all need good-quality social care. Yet as it stands, the number of care homes is actually in decline — from 18,000 to 16,600 in the past nine years.  It’s already taking its toll on our finances: people with dementia have spent one million days in hospital beds when they should have been in care or nursing homes — costing the NHS more than £340 million.  This is the stark reality our new Prime Minister will face.  To end the dementia care crisis, he — whoever he is — must act. We have no time to lose.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, Mar 3, 2020  Shanghai Government Officially Recommends Vitamin C for COVID-19  by Andrew W. Saul  OMNS Mar 3, 2020 The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. 1 Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.  These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.  Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.  Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.  An official statement from Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital 2 reads:  On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury ALI and acute respiratory distress ARDS.

Researchers in central China study coronavirus samples as some wonder whether the disease escaped from a Wuhan laboratory. AFP via Getty Images  At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.  A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.  Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”  Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?  It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.  That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Enlarge Image A member of a medical staff checks the body temperature of a patient who has displayed mild symptoms of the coronavirus.

Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.  According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.  Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen’s job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.  Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.  And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.  You heard me right.  Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.  Enlarge Image Members of a police sanitation team spray disinfectant as a preventive measure against the spread of the coronavirus. AFP via Getty Images  Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.  They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.  I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.  The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.  China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.  But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.  I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring.

eabcaf9a,"Net migration could fall by about 100,000 a year if the UK leaves the EU and introduces work permits for EU citizens, a pressure group has said.  Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report disingenuous.  He said it was another example of fudging the facts.      Follow the latest updates with BBC Politics Live  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.  The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. lineimage copyrightNot Specified Analysis The Union Jack flag next to the European Flagimage copyrightReuters image captionThe Conservatives have promised to hold an in/out referendum on the EU by the end of 2017  BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw  No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration.  It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. lineimage copyrightNot Specified 'Pressure on services'  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future, he said.  Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries, he said.  Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000. Graph showing long-term international migration to the UK  The figures should not be taken as a precise estimate but were intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined, it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are self-sufficient would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. 'No evidence'  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics ONS figures  ","Leaving EU 'would cut migration by 100,000' - Migration Watch",other
68bf269b,"WISCONSIN — Trump’s failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin and across the country. Farmers have been dumping milk, setting their crops on fire, and euthanizing their livestock because there is no market for their products. All the while, millions of more Americans are going hungry because they lost their jobs.  But farmers were struggling long before coronavirus hit the United States. Trump’s chaotic trade wars, particularly with China, obliterated the markets Wisconsin farmers spent decades building in just a short few months. During this time Trump and his administration told Wisconsinites the pain would be “temporary,” that farmers were “over the hump,” and that small and medium-sized family farms should just get bigger if they want to survive.  Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his reelection chances. He used their pain to push through a multi-billion dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies. After getting rolled by China on a trade deal that was a mere fraction of what he promised it would be, a recent news report confirms that Trump was never interested in bettering the lives of Wisconsin’s farmers and was simply looking out for his own political interests.  “Donald Trump crushed our farmers and the local economies they support because he only sees them as a bargaining chip, not human beings and Wisconsinites,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman said. “Trump has been a lapdog for China as he has rolled over for them at every turn. It’s been made clear by recent news reports that Trump gambled with farmers’ livelihoods because he thought it would be good for his reelection prospects. But after decimating these communities, they’re not willing to give him another four years — they know they can’t afford it.”  Wisconsin Examiner: Farms go from frying pan of trade wars to fire of COVID-19  Coxhead said trade policies under President Donald Trump…contributed significantly to the plight of Wisconsin farmers in the last few years. The federal government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic has further endangered the country’s — and Wisconsin’s — position in the world economy, he added.  Wisconsin State Farmer: Economic recovery after pandemic will be slow for farmers due to trade and internet issues  He also said the Trump administration’s volatile relationship with China, one of the country’s biggest trading partners, is a cause for concern. And a widespread lack of high-speed internet access in rural areas is causing many rural economies to fall behind entirely. “The global economic recovery, which will outpace the United States, is not really going to benefit us all that well because the administration has turned its back on international trade,” Coxhead said.  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Coronavirus has hit Wisconsin dairy farms especially hard — some farmers may even have to dump milk  Coronavirus is delivering a blow to Wisconsin agriculture…export markets are threatened by global trade unrest, and some farms may not make it through the spring. “The coronavirus outbreak has caused milk prices to drop down to unprofitable levels this spring…We also need to be prepared for the scenarios that would require our members to dump milk”…”or dispose of it in some other manner,”…the stimulus package won’t resolve long-term issues such as increased global competition and trade wars that may arise from countries closing their borders to curb the spread of COVID-19.

d115ab59,"By The Truth Denied  The American Bank Note Bldg. American Bank Note Company is a subsidiary of American Banknote Corporation and products range from currencies and credit cards to passports, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates.  In the USA, citizens have never obtained their original Birth Certificates — what they possess is a copy. Furthermore, these ‘copies’ have a serial number on them, issued on special Bank Bond paper and authorized by “The American Bank Note Company”. More on this later.  The original birth or naturalization record for every U.S. Citizen is held with Washington, D.C. and the property and assets of every living U.S. Citizen is pledged as collateral for the National Debt.  Every citizen is given a number *the red number on the Birth Certificate and each live birth is reported to be valued at 650,000 to 750,000 Federal Reserve dollars in collateral from the Fed. Hence the saying “we are owned by the system”.LITERALLY.  FACT: The government recognizes two distinct classes of citizens: a state Citizen and a federal citizen. Learn the difference now.  “There are hundreds of thousands of sovereigns in the United States of America but I am not one of them. The sovereigns own their land in “allodium.” That is, the government does not have a financial interest in the their land. Because of this they do not need to pay property tax school tax, real estate tax. Only the powers granted to the federal government in the Constitution for the United States of America define the laws that they have to follow.  This is a very small subset of the laws most of us have to follow. Unless they accept benefits from or contract with the federal government, they do not have to pay Social Security tax, federal income tax, or resident individual state income tax.  They do not need to register their cars or get a driver’s license unless they drive commercially. They will not have to get a Health Security Card. They can own any kind of gun without a license or permit. They do not have to use the same court system that normal people do. ~  *See below for information re: State Citizenship How to become a…  “Unbeknownst to most people, the class termed “US citizen” did not exist as a political status until 1866. It was a class and “political status” created for the newly freed slaves and did not apply to the people inhabiting the states of the union who were at that time state Citizens.” ~ Mr. Richard James, McDonald, former law enforcement, California  Now do the math.  If indeed 317 million US citizens are worth an average of $700,000 in collateral for the US debt, that would mean the US is worth roughly 222 Trillion dollars.  Your birth certificate is really a bank note, which means you, the citizen are what is known in the stock market as a commodity.  DEFINITION of ‘Commodity’  1. A basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When they are traded on an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards, also known as a basis grade.  2. Any good exchanged during commerce, which includes goods traded on a commodity exchange.  So if you didn’t catch it the first time, I will repeat myself at the risk of being redundant.

Background on American Bank Note Company: The following was printed to the editor by the New York times.  AMERICAN BANK NOTE COMPANY, NEW-YORK, Saturday, Dec. 2, 1865.NEW YORK TIMES  “To the Editor of New-York Times:  The attention of this company has been drawn to a paragraph from the Washington Star of the 30th ult., giving an account of some examination made at the Treasury Department as to the evidence of the surreptitious impression of a genuine plate, used by the counterfeiter in printing the backs of the spurious one hundred dollar compound interest note, having been taken after or before the plates and dies prepared by the American Bank Note Company were delivered by that company to the Treasury Department.  This paragraph states this “investigation shows that the counterfeits are made up from a plate surreptitiously obtained from this the American Bank Note Company.”  This statement is supported by a supposed demonstration, which to those familiar with the business will need no refutation, and which would amuse the counterfeiter, whoever he may be. And as no other reason, and no actual proof is pretended to support this imputation upon the security of plates and dies in the custody of the company, the paragraph might be left to every careful reader’s own correction.  I beg, however, the favor of stating, through your paper, that this company is ready to submit to, and give every aid to, any examination into the matter which the Treasury Department may desire; and that “experts” or plain men, upon the most thorough scrutiny, will have no doubt that the surreptitious impression was made from the genuine plate in the hands of the government, and after it was changed from the condition in which it was delivered by this company.

With operations world wide its products range from currencies and credit cards to passports, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates.  How does this work?  Why didn’t you learn this in school? According to many sources, including an excerpt from researcher Brian Kelly,  “When the UNITED STATES declared bankruptcy, pledged all Americans as collateral against the national debt, and confiscated all gold, eliminating the means by which you could pay, it also assumed legal responsibility for providing a new way for you to pay, and it did that by providing what is known as the Exemption, an exemption from having to pay for anything. In practical terms, though, this meant giving each American something to pay with, and that \”something\” is your credit.      Your value to society was then and still is calculated using actuarial tables and at birth, bonds equal to this \”average value\” are created. I understand that this is currently between one and two million dollars. These bonds are collateralized by your birth certificate which becomes a negotiable instrument. The bonds are hypothecated, traded until their value is unlimited for all intents and purposes, and all that credit created is technically and rightfully yours.  In point of fact, you should be able to go into any store in America and buy anything and everything in sight, telling the clerk to charge it to your Exemption account, which is identified by a nine-digit number that you will recognize as your Social Security number without the dashes. It is your EIN, which stands for Exemption Identification Number.”  The FEDERAL RESERVE BANK is not owned and controlled by the U.S. Government, rather it is owned and operated by International families. You are owned by foreigners bankers and your physical body is a collateral bond that has been issued on all your future earnings, your children’s future earnings, etc. Were you taught this in school?  Why not?  If this is indeed the case, how do you change your current status?  The fact is, thousands of citizens have already changed their ‘slavery’ status by means of relinquishing the agreement and reverting to their Sovereign status inalienable rights, the status you were born with such as constitutional rights of life, liberty, and property which are not transferable and, thus, are termed inalienable.  Questions to ask yourself:  What type of person are you?  What class of citizen are you?  Can you change this status?  The Uniform Commercial Code UCC and the law of contracts make it difficult to conduct business in the USA. Now that you know your Birth certificateregistration of birth is nothing more than a Contract with the government, what will you do to change this? Did they tell you you were signing a contract. Did you know that you didn’t even have to register the birth?  How does one reclaim their state Citizenship?  Here is the starting point on how to restore your first class citizenship status.

9.68E+13,"The HPV vaccine is far more effective than expected, with benefits extending beyond those who receive the vaccine, a study published Wednesday finds.  The new study, published in The Lancet, suggests that the more people who receive the vaccine, the better. That’s because vaccination not only reduces rates of HPV infection and the presence of precancerous cells in the cervix in people who receive the vaccine, it also reduces rates of HPV-related diseases in people who were not vaccinated.  The findings come as a U.S. federal advisory panel recommended Wednesday that the HPV vaccine be given to both men and women up to age 26.  HPV, or human papillomavirus, is the leading cause of cervical cancer. The virus can also cause other cancers, including cancers of the penis, head and neck, as well as conditions like genital warts.  The HPV vaccine was first introduced in 2006. Since then, more than 115 countries and territories have implemented it in their vaccination programs. The World Health Organization recommends that girls ages 9 to 13 receive two doses of the vaccine.  “The impact of the HPV vaccination has actually exceeded expectations,” said Lauri Markowitz, associate director of science for HPV at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who worked on the study. The trials showed that HPV vaccines are very effective, and data from the real world has confirmed that.”  Indeed, the reductions in HPV infections and precancerous cells “are a first sign that vaccination could eventually lead to the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem,” the study's lead author, Mélanie Drolet, an epidemiologist at Laval University in Canada, said in a statement.  The Lancet study expanded upon a 2015 meta-analysis that had looked at the real-world effects of the vaccine. The new analysis was updated to include a total of 65 studies, which spanned eight years and included more than 60 million people living in 14 countries. Each study measured either changes in the number of new HPV infections, genital warts diagnoses or cases of abnormal cells associated with cervical cancer in countries before and after they adopted routine HPV vaccination in girls. Two countries included in the analysis, the U.S. and Australia, also recommend the vaccine for boys.  The impact of the HPV vaccination has actually exceeded expectations.  The researchers found that, in these countries, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of two strains of HPV that cause 70 percent of cervical cancers, HPV 16 and 18. There are more than 100 strains of HPV, 14 of which are known to cause cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against up to 9 strains. In addition, there was a decrease in the prevalence of precancerous cells in the cervix, which can develop into cancer.  What’s more, in countries where at least half the population that was targeted for vaccination had actually received the vaccine, researchers saw evidence of herd immunity, meaning there was a decrease in the prevalence of HPV-related diseases even among those who weren’t vaccinated. This is because vaccination leads to fewer HPV hosts.  These countries also saw a decrease in genital warts diagnoses among unvaccinated boys and older women. And among girls within the age groups targeted for vaccination, there were fewer diagnoses of three HPV strains that the vaccine does not specifically protect against, a phenomenon called cross-protection. Countries in which people in multiple age groups received the vaccine also saw a greater decrease in HPV-related disease.  This paper shows that with a broader age range that’s targeted, you’ll find greater impact in your vaccination program,” Markowitz told NBC News.  Lagging vaccination rates  Despite the widespread benefits of the vaccine, however, HPV vaccination rates in the U.S. are still lagging behind those of other adolescent immunizations. The U.S. was the first country to implement HPV vaccination for both genders, but the CDC has found that many parents and health care providers don’t yet see a need to vaccinate boys. Parents have also expressed concerns about the vaccine and its costs, the CDC found.  According to Debbie Saslow, managing director of HPV and gynecological cancers at the American Cancer Society, the lagging rates are not entirely because parents are against vaccinating their kids; rather, the way some doctors are presenting the vaccine also plays a role.  Two required vaccinations, for tetanus and meningitis, are administered at the same time as HPV, around age 12. Saslow said HPV is usually presented as an optional third vaccine at that time, and one that patients can delay another year.  “Providers often think they’re recommending all three vaccines, but they’re actually making the third, the HPV vaccine, optional,” Saslow told NBC News. “They’re just suggesting it or doctors are setting it apart from the other two in some way.”  The fact that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection could also be a hard concept for parents to come to terms with. Saslow said beliefs about sex may be a factor that deters parents from opting to have their children vaccinated against HPV.  “Despite all that, vaccination rates are continuing to grow,” she said.  Indeed, the number of adolescents in the U.S. who received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine has increased by 5 percent each year since 2013. The CDC recommends everyone receive the first dose by age 12. Though adults up to age 45 can still be vaccinated, the vaccine may be less effective. And while the WHO does recommend that girls 9 to 13 get vaccinated against HPV, it does not yet recommend that all genders receive the vaccination. That could change in response to study results that continue to show the vaccine has substantial impact on public health.  Cancer prevention  That impact on public health is cancer prevention. Ultimately, that’s the “main goal of the HPV vaccination program, Markowitz said. We’re seeing an impact on one of the HPV outcomes that is close to a cancer outcome.” Because cervical cancer can take decades to develop, it’s not yet possible to study the effects of the vaccine on cervical cancer rates, Drolet noted in the statement.  In particular, the study found the HPV vaccine led to a reduction in the rates of abnormal pap smear findings. Pap smears are used to detect abnormal cells in the cervix that can sometimes develop into cancer. Five to nine years after a population was vaccinated against HPV, the researchers found a more than 50 percent reduction in cases of these pre-cancerous cells in girls 15 to 19. In vaccinated women 20 to 24, there were one-third fewer cases of these cells.  A separate study, published in April in The BMJ, found a 90 percent reduction in cases of pre-cancerous cells in young women in Scotland within the first decade of introducing the HPV vaccine.  But vaccination is only one piece of cervical cancer prevention; screening is also necessary.  Whether or not a person has received the HPV vaccine, getting cervical cells regularly tested — through Pap tests and HPV screening — is still a crucial to reducing cases of cervical cancer and early detection, said Diane Harper, senior associate director of the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. Rates of invasive cervical cancer dropped significantly in the U.S. when cancer screening was introduced in the 1940s, and there were less than half the number of cases in 2007 that there were in 1973, largely due to screening.  “Vaccination and screening together make a program,” Harper told NBC News. “Very few HPV cases progress into cancer, but the only way we’re going to find those that do is through the screening program.”  FOLLOW NBC HEALTH ON TWITTER & FACEBOOK","HPV vaccine benefits 'exceed expectations,' may lead to elimination of cervical cancer",TRUE

Redding CA— A new peer-reviewed study in the journal SAGE Open Medicine details the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children from three pediatric practices in the United States concludes that unvaccinated children have better health outcomes than their vaccinated peers.  Children in the study were followed continuously for a minimum of 3 years from birth. The study was based on medical records of over 2000 children enrolled in three pediatric practices and born between November 2005 and June 2015. Vaccination status was determined based on any vaccination received prior to one year of age which yielded 30.9% of the children in the unvaccinated group. Results show that vaccination before one year of age led to significantly increased odds of medical diagnoses of developmental delays, asthma and ear infections in children.  In a separate analysis, based on the number of vaccines received by one year of age, children receiving more vaccines were more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal disorders compared to those who received no vaccines within the same timeframe. In temporal analyses, children vaccinated prior to six months of age showed significant risks of each of the disorders studied as compared to unvaccinated children in the same timeframe.  The study, coauthored by Dr. Brian Hooker and Mr. Neil Miller, is unique in that all diagnoses were verified using abstracted medical records from each of the participating pediatric practices. Lead author of the study, Dr. Hooker, stated, “The results definitely indicate better health outcomes in children who did not receive vaccines within their first year of life. These findings are consistent with additional research that has identified vaccination as a risk factor for a variety of adverse health outcomes . Such findings merit additional large-scale study of vaccinated and unvaccinated children in order to provide optimal health as well as protection against infectious diseases.”  ###",New Research Study Clarifies Health Outcomes in Vaccinated versus Unvaccinated Children,other

The 2020 Trump campaign is now mounting a legal challenge to prevent the certification of fraudulent election results in Wisconsin.  Look at this in Wisconsin! A day AFTER the election, Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly. This is unbelievable! pic.twitter.com/nhiLMmyHBn — Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump November 19, 2020  Meanwhile, witnesses of voting fraud in Detroit, Michigan have come forward to detail alleged ballot dumps in favor of Biden. In a video testimony Wednesday, poll worker Kristina Karamo said she personally witnessed spoiled and invalid ballots being awarded to Biden.  “It was like so much going on, but I did personally witness the ballots being delivered between 3 o’clock and 3:30 a.m.,” she stated. “So I did personally witness ballots arriving at the time.”  Karamo, who worked at Detroit’s TCF Center, also said election officials did not review signatures on ballots. She added, suspicious batches of ballots were delivered to the TCF Center at night and all of them went to Biden.  Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul R-Ky. is calling for an investigation of suspected voter fraud in key battleground states.  “We need to figure out how many votes came in after the deadline and the court has ruled those are illegal,” he noted. “Then if it’s a significant number, we need to figure out and readjust the totals so the votes will now be illegal.”  On Wednesday, the senator said the 2020 Trump campaign should check samples of 2,000 random votes for fraud and other irregularities. He added, this would allow officials to build a statistical model to prove rampant voter fraud in court.","Evidence of ballot dumping found in Wis., Mich.",FALSE
2244d27f,"I&I Editorial  Joe Biden’s $2 trillion climate change plan, released this week, was described by one liberal outlet as “the Green New Deal, minus the crazy.” We beg to differ. Just look at Biden’s plan to eliminate the internal combustion engine.  Biden says that on his first day in office, he will develop “rigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100% of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be zero emissions.”  He hasn’t said exactly when he wants new cars to be all-electric, but House Democrats have already established a timetable. Their new climate change plan calls for mandating 100% “clean” vehicles by 2035.  Keep in mind that as of today, plug-in electrics account for 0.5% of cars on the road, and made up less than 2% of new vehicles sold in 2019. And that’s despite massive public subsidies that have cost taxpayers $5 billion in credits to — mostly wealthy — EV buyers.  Clearly, consumers are not that interested in plug-ins, which is why Biden and his fellow Democrats want to force electric cars on everyone in the name of climate change.  Aside from fuel economy mandates, Biden also wants to extend and expand the EV tax credit, pump federal money into charging stations, and create a new “cash for clunkers” program for those who trade in a gasoline-powered car for a plug-in.  The cost of all this? Who knows. Aside from the $2 trillion price tag that Biden put on his entire Green New Deal plan, he hasn’t broken down his EV mandate scheme. But Sen. Chuck Schumer has already proposed a cash-for-clunkers plan, which would cost $454 billion over a decade.  And for all this, the electric car mandate will have a negligible impact on CO2 emissions and zero impact on the climate.  For one thing, the CO2 advantage of electric cars is vastly oversold. These are not “zero emissions” vehicles. They simply change the source of the emissions from the car to power plants — most of them powered by coal and natural gas.  A study by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute found that when you factor in CO2 emissions from electricity production, the average plug-in produces as much CO2 over its lifetime as a gas-powered car that gets 55 miles per gallon.  The CO2 advantage of electric cars diminishes even more when you consider the entire lifecycle of the vehicle, including the environmental impact of mining required to manufacture the batteries. A study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that CO2 emissions from manufacturing electric cars was 68% higher than gas-powered cars.  When you add it up, the impact on the climate is zero. A report from the Manhattan Institute notes that even if every car on the road were replaced with electric vehicles by 2050, “the resulting reduction in CO2 emissions would be less than 500 million tons per year.” That reduction, it says “will have no measurable impact on world climate.”  The rest of Biden’s environmental plan is equally untethered from reality. Take his proposal to have all the nation’s electricity produced by “clean” fuels by 2035.  Today, 20% of electricity comes from renewable sources. The Energy Information Administration says that based on current trends, that will increase to 32% by 2035 and 38% by 2050.  That’s a long way from 100%.  Plus, a fifth of today’s renewable energy comes from hydroelectric power, which has been declining as a source of energy in part because environmentalists hate dams. Another 43% comes from biomass, which environmentalists also consider dirty.  As the Natural Resources Defense Council put it, “biomass energy damages our climate and air, our forests, and our communities while the industry hides behind veils of misinformation.  That leaves solar and wind, which are massive land hogs. Proposed solar plants in Virginia would eat up 490 square miles of land — which would be like covering all of Los Angeles in solar panels. A single 50 turbine wind farm requires 23 square miles, notes Real Clear Investigations. Both energy sources are uneconomical without generous government subsidies.  Then there’s Biden’s promise that the entire U.S. economy will produce zero carbon emissions by 2050.  When the Heritage Foundation tried to calculate the economic impact of the carbon taxes needed to cut CO2 emissions by just more than half, it crashed their economic model.  The Green New Deal was never about saving the planet. It’s always been about the left’s desire to gain control of every aspect of our economy and our lives. Biden’s version might be a modestly watered-down version of the one proposed by socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but it’s hardly any less crazy.  Update: A “fact-checking” site took issue with the headline of this editorial, claiming it was false, which led Facebook to put a warning label on our post claiming the same thing. We took issue with that in a follow-up editorial. We’d also note that since this editorial posted, Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. Harris is co-sponsor of a bill — The Zero Emission Vehicles Act — that would ban the sale of gas-powered car sales starting in 2040.  — Written by the I&I Editorial Board  Will You Help Us In The Fight For Free Speech?

e3f1155e,"Editor’s Note: The headline of this article has been altered to more accurately reflect how findings of the study on fermented cabbage in Europe may correlate with kimchi, a fermented cabbage, in South Korea and other Asian countries in helping to lower COVID-19 fatalities.  Low COVID-19 fatality rates in South Korea may be attributed to kimchi, a recent study has found.  The study: A team of researchers in France, led by Pulmonary Medicine at Montpellier University honorary professor Dr. Jean Bousquet, conducted a study on the dietary preferences of countries with low fatalities from the novel coronavirus.       Reported in Clinical and Translational Allergy, a similar study found that countries where diet mainly consists of fermented cabbage had lower reported deaths from the virus.     According to the report, fermented cabbage in dishes helps in reducing levels of ACE2, an enzyme in the lungs that COVID-19 uses to gain access to the bodies of patients.      With a lower amount of ACE2, it becomes more difficult for the virus to enter the body, reported The Sun.  Which countries specifically: In South Korea, where the fermented cabbage dish kimchi is a staple food, 296 people have died out of 13,771 infected with COVID-19, registering a fatality rate of 2.14%.  Read More Advertisement      Meanwhile, Germany’s sauerkraut is also seen as a reason for their low death rate of 4.51% 9,163 deaths out of 202,845 cases as of this writing.  In Italy 14.33%, Spain 9.24% and the United Kingdom 15.36%, and other countries where fermented cabbage is not a regular part of the diet, the death rate is comparatively higher.       Consumption of yogurt or caviar has also helped Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey to have low COVID-19 death rates.     “Coronavirus binds to ACE2 that induces oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. Fermented foods have potent antioxidant activity and can protect against severe Covid-19,” Dr Bousquet, the former Chairman of the WHO Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases, noted in the report.  Power of kimchi: In addition to the high antioxidants and vitamin C packed in cabbage, the fermentation process creates probiotics that support the “gut microbiome,” which helps for a better immune response in the body, multiple studies have shown.      In a separate study by the University of Leipzig in Germany, it was found that eating fermented food can give a boost to a person’s immune system.    Earlier research has also pointed out the benefits of healthy intestinal microbiome in fine-tuning the immune system and preventing damaging inflammation inside the body.     Back in April, the New York Post reported on the surge in sales of both sauerkraut and kimchi amid the pandemic.     New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology clinical chief Dr. Robert Brown attributed such rise in sales in the perception that these types of food will protect them against the virus.     “When there’s a perception that there’s very little else you can do, you want to do something,” Dr. Brown said.  Not a miracle drug: When COVID-19 started to spread globally in January, South Korea’s Health Ministry released a statement warning that kimchi should not be seen as a “wonder drug” against the virus.      In a press release, the ministry cautioned that the Korean staple food provides no protection against the virus, noting that the best protection is frequent hand washing.

18d2b528," Special Operations SOF units including 4,000 deputized National Guard soldiers acting as US Marshalls, have served indictments on, or were about to arrest 67% of Congress. Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am Military vans, buses and police cars, along with a multitude of police and Military troops, were very busy at a blacked out White House. “I just watched everyone in the White House arrested” declared an unnamed person doing one of the two videos shown below. Video contains graphic language https://youtu.be/ywfXNGNvvuU Even though the Mass Media have refused to report it, the US has been functioning under Martial Law since Sat. 9 Jan. An Interim Military US Government was actually running the US and they saw President Biden as a treasonous agent. A few days before Joe Biden’s Inauguration and due to foreign interference in the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump had instigated the Insurgency Act, declared Martial Law and deferred his power to the US Military. Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House. According to two separate videos taped at the scene, police and US troops were everywhere in the darkness. Military vans, buses and police cars pulled up to the White House, loaded passengers, took them down the road and across a bridge and then some vans came back empty to do a repeat. Mustang Medic’s recording showed many buses and vans, some marked as Military, entering the Capitol grounds. Several people were taped getting out of their cars, showing IDs to guards and then walking into the grounds. https://rumble.com/vdawtd-mass-arrest-at-the-capitol.html When it was over and seemingly on Q, fireworks lit up the sky. Reports from those on the ground claimed that by later that day the White House was closed up tight and remained so as of right now. https://youtu.be/iqjVRcSejWU Evidently Biden’s team was not in the White House, but detained and arrested behind the scenes. The US Military was expected to have arrested Harris on charges of treason, while invoking the 25th Amendment on Biden because of his dementia and subsequent inability to hold office. The Deep State had plans to invoke the 25th on Biden, put Harris in his place and Pelosi as VP. Not going to happen. On Fri. 22 Jan. a Juan O Savin reported that the US Interim Military Government was about to arrest Joe Biden and his traitor Deep State politicians in DC. Crimes of these elite politicians have recently been exposed from findings of the Russia hoax Mueller probe, impeachments of Trump and Obamagate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT57EP1wL9g&feature=share It was reported that to date, 260 global elites have been served, “The deal that they got was that if they gave information that was useful, they could have a better death, or a jail cell for life.

fff1cb16,"Natural News A 2012 study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases finds that children who received inactivated influenza vaccines were 440% more likely relative risk: 4.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-14.8 to acquire infections of respiratory viral pathogens which are not influenza. With the aggressive push for influenza immunizations now under way, the medical establishment may be setting up children to be extremely vulnerable to coronavirus infections. Titled, “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine,” the study is found at this link at the National Library of Medicine: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/ The study finds that flu shots quite literally inactivate parts of the human immune system, rendering the child more vulnerable to coronavirus infections. “Being protected against influenza, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses,” the study authors write. The study authors explain that the influenza vaccine works to prevent influenza virus infections, but at the same time it makes children more susceptible to other respiratory infections. Since the Infection Fatality Rate IFR for seasonal influenza is so low around 0.024%, which is not a typo, and the Infection Fatality Rate of covid-19 infections is at least one order of magnitude higher, it raises the obvious question: Would it save more lives of children to avoid administering flu shots this year and therefore reduce their vulnerability to covid-19, which has a far higher fatality rate? The study, which was conducted in 2009, observed the outcomes of 115 children aged 6 – 16 years. The study also used a placebo group and found that placebo made “no statistically significant difference” in the risk of acute respiratory infection risk. But children who received influenza vaccines had a much higher risk of respiratory infections. Even more shockingly, the study also found no difference in the risk of seasonal influenza infections between those children who were vaccinated vs. those who weren’t. In other words, the influenza vaccine offered no protection against the flu, but it created increased vulnerability to other respiratory infections. No benefits, just increased risks. “There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between recipients of TIV or placebo,” the study explains. You can see the increased number of respiratory infections in this chart. Note the “TIV” column means those children who were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine: The conclusion is that influenza vaccines make children more susceptible to other respiratory viral infections. From the study, which took place more than a decade before the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic: We identified a statistically significant increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients Table 3, including significant increases in the risk of rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus infection, which were most frequently detected in March 2009, immediately after the peak in seasonal influenza activity in February 2009. The study authors point out that the influenza vaccine, “could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism,” although they also state more research is needed because some of the self-reporting of symptoms may have introduced “artifacts” which could sway the numbers. Nevertheless, the study authors also state that this phenomenon of “viral interference” is well known: Participants who received TIV would have been protected against influenza in February 2009 but then would not have had heightened nonspecific immunity in the following weeks… The phenomenon of virus interference has been well known in virology for >60 years [24–27]. Ecological studies have reported phenomena potentially explained by viral interference [3–11]… Interference in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections has been reported after receipt of live oral poliovirus vaccine [29–32]. Those who push flu shots may be worsening the coronavirus pandemic The upshot of this research is that those who are pushing flu shots for children may in fact be worsening the coronavirus pandemic, creating “perfect storm” conditions for children to become carriers of the Wuhan coronavirus that causes covid-19. This is consistent with the fact that we now know the medical establishment has acted to deliberately worsen covid-19 fatalities by, for example, conspiring the destroy the credibility of hydroxychloroquine, working to maximize fatalities in order to reap a windfall of profits from the coronavirus vaccine. Yes, the medical and science establishment quite literally arranges for more people to die in order to keep the coronavirus fear alive, resulting in more demand for high-profit vaccines. As always, it’s all about the money. As Gary Heavin recently wrote in a warning to America, Big Pharma operatives are “accessories to murder.” How does Big Pharma have so much control over the dissemination of this information or should I say propaganda? Well, the same answer pops up again, money. Big Pharma gave $2 billion dollars during the last election cycle to US politicians. Big AG, the military/security complex and big oil each gave only a paltry $1.0 billion dollars to buy the votes of our political leadership. The MSM counts Big Pharma’s advertising revenue at up to 80% of their income. The internet’s “masters of the universe” also kowtow to Big Pharma’s influence and advertising dollars by censoring anyone who tries to tell the American people the truth about Covid 19. It certainly appears that anyone who is complicit in this Great Deception, a deception that is designed to kill and terrify enough people to ultimately beg for an experimental vaccine, well, these people would be accessories to murder. Flu shots are being hyped to suppress immune systems and create an explosion in coronavirus infections Flu shots, it seems, are one more way the medical establishment can literally murder children and adults, creating widespread vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic which will no doubt surge back this Fall as flu shots work to suppress the immune systems of millions. Recognize that the people pushing flu shots are medical murderers, and many are deliberately trying to kill as many people as possible to create demand for the high-profit coronavirus vaccines that are about to be unleashed on America, probably before the end of this year. It’s the perfect crime: Manufacture vaccines that suppress the immune system right in the middle of a pandemic, causing more infections and deaths, leading to more calls for mandatory vaccines. The drug companies will cash in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars while innocent children and adults all across America needlessly suffer and die. As usual, it’s all about the money, and the vaccine / drug cartels are murderous, criminal regimes that twisted science Dr. Fauci? to maximize profits at any cost.

29b21551,"Dave Janda of Operation Freedom www.DaveJanda.com has unleashed a bombshell story with huge implications for Tuesday’s elections. Janda’s guest in his latest broadcast is a former high-level intelligence official Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney who warns that the Dems and the CIA have put in place a mechanism which can alter the voting results of electronic voting machines in key swing states like Pennsylvania that will determine the outcome of the election.  This covert technology is called Operation Scorecard, and it was built by the CIA to surreptitiously steal elections in targeted countries. Now, that technology is being turned against the United States of America and is about to be activated on Tuesday to steal the election for Biden, explains Janda’s guest.  OmegaManRadio, a pro-liberty, pro-Christian podcast channel, has reposted portions of the Dave Janda interview at this link on Soundcloud.com. Start listening around the 20 minute mark to hear the bombshell segments.  The original interview from Dave Janda is currently available via YouTube but is likely to be blacklisted soon. Here’s the YouTube embed:  As McInerney explains in the video, after the closing of polls in Pennsylvania and other swing states, the voting machines will be intercepted and then altered using complex algorithms to alter the votes in a way that evades detection, handing a victory to the pre-designated “winner” Joe Biden.  Smells like FREEDOM. Order Founders Blend Organic Coffee from Freedom First Coffee. Use NOQ as the promo code for 10% off!  In the interview, he explains that a covert app called “Scorecard” steals votes by making sure Democrats always stay about 3% ahead of their Republican rivals. “Scorecard steals the elections by tampering with the computers at the transfer points,” he adds.  This also explains why Joe Biden recently said, with great clarity, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.”  Here’s the video of Biden bragging about the massive voter fraud system that’s being used to try to to steal the election for him:  This might also help explain why Joe Biden told voters at a recent small rally that he didn’t “need their vote” to become President, and why Nancy Pelosi says Biden will win no matter what the votes say on Nov. 3rd.  The deep state has a plan in place to steal this election by altering votes in key swing states. And if Trump challenges the fraud, he will be condemned for “refusing to accept the outcome” of the rigged election. This is the narrative trap that has been set by the treasonous mainstream media.  Keep in mind that just over the last two days, Trump campaign officials were asking for detailed information about how voting machines are handled in Pennsylvania. According to the anti-Trump Washington Post a deep state propaganda mouthpiece:  …the Trump campaign asked officials in Cumberland County for the names of people who transport ballots and voting machines once polls close, the names of people who have access to the ballots afterward, and the precise locations where the ballots are stored, including room numbers.  It seems that Trump’s people are already aware that Dems are working to fraudulently steal this election by altering votes in Pennsylvania, and they’re trying to stop it.  Be aware that unless Trump receives an overwhelming wave of votes on Tuesday — beyond the margin of Democrat fraud — the Dems have a mechanism in place to steal the election, condemn Trump for challenging the vote theft, and seizing control of the White House from this day forward.

Without this, we are just a land of savages like other places that have rejected Christianity.  Just look at Nazi Germany and New Zealand.

That is why he has worked so hard on crafting his most recent Executive Order. It will allow churches to operate as the essential businesses that they are.  Executive Order 66 states the following:  “As of today, all churches in the United States of America are classified as essential businesses. This will require them to remain open for all people at all times. In addition, since they are now classified as businesses, they will be entitled to taxation provisions by the IRS. In essence, they will now pay the taxes they have been avoiding for all these years.”  This is great news for Americans. They can get back to church and God will be back.

He claims to be following the CDC guidelines, but instead is expanding on them, saying we need to hire 1000 new contract tracers when positive cases aren’t significantly increasing. The governor also wants to postpone reopening until we increase testing when we are currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity. These are not criteria for reopening, they’re roadblocks.  “While DHS reports that 60% of counties have fewer than 10 cases, and 10% have none, Governor Evers is doubling down on his plan to keep the entire state locked down until after Memorial Day, well past every state in the region.  “We continue to call on the governor to retreat from his one-size-fits-all approach and allow the state to safely open up regionally so people can get back to work. Wisconsin is a diverse state; obviously, the Northwoods can’t be treated like Dane and Milwaukee counties. Using the CDC guidelines, it appears portions of the state would be only days away from the first phase of reopening.  “Wisconsinites need certainty during these uncertain times. As we have seen too often throughout the pandemic, the governor says something one day and the opposite the next. That is why we can’t afford to withdraw our impending legal action.

a20087aa,"A major new allegation of voter fraud has been raised in Michigan, where a lawsuit filed by the Great Lakes Justice Center on behalf of two poll challengers says multiple levels of improper conduct took place on orders from election officials.  The allegations are aimed at election officials from Detroit and Wayne County, according to a release from the center, and are based on affidavits of named individuals who said they witnessed misconduct.  “This type of widespread fraud in the counting and processing of voter ballots cannot be allowed to stand. Michigan citizens are entitled to know that their elections are conducted in a fair and legal manner and that every legal vote is properly counted,” senior counsel David A. Kallman said in a statement.  “Such rampant fraud cannot be undone. We ask the Court to enjoin the certification of this fraudulent election, void the election, and order a new vote in Wayne County.”  Michigan, along with Pennsylvania, are two major states targeted by President Donald Trump’s campaign, which has alleged widespread voter fraud linked to mail-in ballots cast there.  TRENDING: Liberal Author Naomi Wolf: If I'd Known Biden Supports Lockdowns, 'I Never Would Have Voted for Him'  The lawsuit, filed by poll challengers Cheryl A. Costantino and Edward P. McCall Jr., cite what the legal filing calls “numerous issues of fraud and misconduct.”  The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order that would prohibit officials from certifying the vote until the charges made in the lawsuit can be investigated.  “Defendants systematically processed and counted ballots from voters whose name failed to appear in either the Qualified Voter File QVF or in the supplemental sheets. When a voter’s name could not be found, the election worker assigned the ballot to a random name already in the QVF to a person who had not voted,” the complaint reads.  “Defendants instructed election workers to not verify signatures on absentee ballots, to backdate absentee ballots, and to process such ballots regardless of their validity,” the complaint went on, adding another allegation that election workers were told “to process ballots that appeared after the election deadline and to falsely report that those ballots had been received prior to November 3, 2020 deadline.”  Do you believe vote fraud happened in Michigan?

There were tens of thousands of these absentee ballots, and apparently every ballot was counted and attributed only to Democratic candidates,” the complaint read.  “Unsecured ballots arrived at the TCF Center loading garage, not in sealed ballot boxes, without any chain of custody, and without envelopes.”  The complaint alleged that some ballots arrived in vehicles with out-of-state license plates, and that “[i]t was observed that all of these new ballots were cast for Joe Biden.”  The complaint went on to claim that election workers “systematically used false information to process ballots, such as using incorrect or false birthdays. Many times, the election workers inserted new names into the QVF after the election and recorded these new voters as having a birthdate of 1/1/1900.”  RELATED: Federal Investigators Arrive in Michigan After Viral Video Seems To Reveal Alleged Fraud  Oversight was denied, according to the complaint.  “Defendant election officials and workers refused to record challenges to their processes and removed challengers from the site if they politely voiced a challenge.

a94e340d,"Joseph R. Biden declared last year on the campaign trail that he began his academic career at Delaware State University, a historically Black college, a claim that the school refutes.  Carlos Holmes, director of news service for Delaware State, said that Mr. Biden was never a student, although he has made appearances twice on campus for commencement speeches at the public university in Dover, one of the nation’s historically Black colleges and universities HBCUs.  “Vice President Biden did not attend DSU,” said Mr. Holmes in a Thursday email. “However he was the Commencement keynote speaker in 2003 and [2016], and during the former he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree.”  Mr. Biden made the claim ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary during a town hall held Oct. 26, 2019, at historic Wilson High School in Florence, which was founded in 1866 by the Freedmen’s Bureau for Black children seeking an education.  “I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State — now, I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State,” Mr. Biden told the audience, drawing laughter, as shown on video. “They’re my folks.”  Mr. Biden, who went on to win the South Carolina primary on his way to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has been long accused of making up the DSU connection, but the university’s denial appears to erase any doubt.  The Washington Times has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.  Mr. Biden’s 2007 memoir, “Promises to Keep,” proceeds from his years at Archmere Academy, a private Catholic school in Clayton, Delaware, to his enrollment as a freshman at the University of Delaware without mentioning Delaware State.  Biden claims he “got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State” when he did not attend the universitypic.twitter.com/LnBOS1wQlT — Tommy Pigott @TCPigott October 26, 2019  The former vice president has been caught numerous times embellishing his biography, including statements that he was the first in his family to attend college and that his relatives worked as coal miners, both of which he later admitted were false.  Mr. Biden has also been accused of exaggerating his record on civil-rights activism, such as his assertions about participating in marches. During his first presidential run in 1987, for example, he declared that he “marched with tens of thousands,” a claim that has been largely discounted.  The 2010 biography “Joe Biden” by veteran political reporter Jules Witcover described him as someone who was sympathetic to the movement but “was taking no visible part in either the local racial unrest or the war protest.”  “It was not until his exposure to black contemporaries as a lifeguard, he said, that he finally began to understand, and then he saw his best engagement as a lawyer, not a marcher,” the book said.

6.21E+08,"Where Will Austin Go For Water Next? By Terrence Henry Email  Tweet    REUTERS /JULIA ROBINSON /LANDOV  The Highland Lakes, the main reservoirs for over a million people in and around Austin, are only a third full. They could reach their lowest levels in history this summer.  As the shores of those lakes receded during the Texas drought, businesses dried up and water quality declined. If you take a trip out to Lake Travis today, you’ll notice the most popular shorebird is the vulture. With the lake 46 feet below where it should be, there’s plenty of shoreline for them.  If the main water supply of a million people is at risk, what’s the ‘Plan B?’  “Unfortunately, there is no ‘Plan B,'” says state Sen. Troy Fraser R-Horseshoe Bay. “We are totally dependent on Mother Nature in this area. It’s really a problem.”  But it’s a problem that finally seems to have gotten the attention of Austin’s city leaders.  Photo by Filipa Rodrigues/StateImpact Texas  The city’s main strategy to deal with the drought up until now has been conservation, and Austinites have answered the call. Per capita, the city is using less water than ever, according to Greg Meszaros, Director of Austin Water.  But rain continues to miss the lakes. Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didn’t help either.  “Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austin’s water use” was sent to rice farmers that year, Meszaros says.  Another silent straw is sucking up water from the lakes: evaporation.The lakes lose almost as much water to evaporation as the city uses every year. Now the city is starting to think about how to extend a shrinking supply.  Courtesy of CERES  Leading part of that effort is Sharlene Leurig, Director of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Program at Ceres, a non-profit specializing in sustainability. Leurig is chairing a new water resource task force under the direction of Austin’s City Council. Their aim is to find solutions that could boost Austin’s water supply.  “There’s no single project that will solve the challenge before us,” Leurig says. But there are a number of projects and tweaks that could significantly improve the situation. Forget big reservoirs: Austin is looking to get creative in finding more water.  Some of the solutions, Leurig says, are sitting right under Austin’s nose. Standing on the shores of Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin, surrounded by joggers and gazing out onto the dog park at Auditorium Shores, Leurig says the pass-through lake is more than just an aesthetic treat for Austinites.  Related Topics What Is The Lower Colorado River Authority?  “Use this as a storage supply,” she says. “That might actually accept treated wastewater produced by the city of Austin for reinjection back into our drinking water system.”  Once treated, Leurig says, the water would be purer than bottled water. Several other cities in Texas, including Wichita Falls, Brownwood and San Angelo are moving forward with or considering wastewater reuse programs.  It’s just one of the many smaller solutions on the Austin water supply smorgasbord, Meszaros of Austin Water says.  “For example, what’s called Walter E. Long Lake, or Decker Lake [in East Austin], there’s no technical reason you couldn’t use that lake as a complement to the water supply,” Meszaros says.  Other ideas on tap? Here are a few being considered by the water resource task force:  Fixing Longhorn dam to better control water flows.  Lowering Lake Austin to catch more rainfall.  Using aquifers underground to store water and prevent evaporation. Meszaros of Austin Water says the city would work to use land it could easily access in order to avoid potentially costly litigation.  Rainwater capture, distributed throughout the city, especially on commercial buildings downtown.  Using a biodegradable powder on the surface of lakes in Austin’s water supply to lower evaporation, starting with smaller lakes like Lady Bird Lake or Walter E. Long Lake.  Securing groundwater access from the Carrizo-Wilcox or Northern Edwards aquifers.  There’s no “silver bullet,” Meszaros says. “There’s no golden barrel of water out there that is vastly available and very low cost. If it were, people would have it already.”  Meszaros estimates that the right mix of projects could add roughly a quarter to nearly three-quarters of Austin’s annual water use from the Highland Lakes.  Leurig of the Water Resource Planning Task Force says the answer to strengthening Austin’s water supply is likely an “all of the above” strategy.  Such a hodge-podge of projects — even small ones — will take time and money. Some are costlier than others like aquifer storage and recovery, and how the city will prioritize and budget the projects remains to be seen. Austin Water is already preparing rate increases to make up for lost revenues during the drought.  Texas Tribune  “The unfortunate thing is, it doesn’t happen overnight,” says state Sen. Fraser.  “We’re about to go through a very hot, difficult summer that I’m very nervous about. Because this event we’re going through was preventable.”  The water resource task force has until June 20th to provide their recommendations to city council. What the council will decide to do then is an open question.  And the region’s water plan is undergoing changes that will likely result in far less water going to rice farmers during dry times. Meszaros of Austin Water says regardless, Austin will continue to rely on the Colorado system.  “The lakes aren’t going to run out of water in any immediate future,” he says. “But we’re gonna be in a potentially long-term situation where they’ll be at relatively low levels compared to their historic norms. Fundamentally, we’re going to be a Colorado River system water supply-driven community for many, many decades to come.”",Where Will Austin Go For Water Next?,TRUE

5ae71da3,"Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, is strongly considering a bid for U.S. Senate, calculating that having Hillary Clinton at the top of the 2016 ticket would help lift her candidacy in a year-of-the-woman campaign.  Driving Wasserman Schultz’s interest: the increasing likelihood that Sen. Marco Rubio will run for the White House and that he ultimately won’t seek reelection in 2016, Democratic insiders familiar with her thinking say. Her office wouldn’t discuss her interest in the Senate.  “Of course she’s considering it: Open Senate seats are pretty rare,” said Andrew Weinstein, a longtime supporter of the Weston congresswoman and a 2012 member of President Barack Obama’s national finance team.  “If you’re a nationally known candidate with a strong fundraising record and a good relationship with your constituents and supporters, you would definitely look at it,” Weinstein added.  Like a number of Democratic insiders — four of whom spoke on condition of anonymity in confirming her Senate interest — Weinstein stressed he wasn’t favoring any potential candidate and didn’t want to appear to slight Rep. Patrick Murphy, who represents Florida’s 18th Congressional District and is considered the most likely Democrat to seek a Senate seat in 2016.  “He is very seriously considering the Senate race — whether Rubio runs or not,” said Eric Johnson, Murphy’s chief of staff and top political adviser.  Also expressing some interest behind the scenes: former Gov. Charlie Crist, who has lost his past two elections — governor in 2012 and Senate in 2010, the latter against Rubio. Crist, who couldn’t be reached, would be far less likely to run for the Senate again if he had to run against an incumbent Rubio.  The same is likely true of Wasserman Schultz, who’s in a safe seat.  Murphy sits in a far more competitive district, though he defeated his Republican opponent handily in 2014.  “It’s not a question of if he loses his seat, but when,” one Democratic consultant said of Murphy. “Make no mistake: He has won two hard races. He knows how to win. He can raise big money. That matters. So it makes sense he’ll run for Senate. And the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] loves the guy.”  Wasserman Schultz has a fraught relationship with some Washington Democrats.  For years, anonymous Democrats in Congress, the DNC and Obama’s election machine have trashed the sometimes-acerbic congresswoman in publications like POLITICO and BuzzFeed.  “Nancy Pelosi views Debbie as a threat,” said one Democratic politician familiar with the dynamics in the U.S. House. “So perhaps they’ll all pitch in together to get her out of the DNC and out of the House and into the Senate where no one can really do anything.”  As DNC chair, Wasserman Schultz has major fundraising responsibilities nationwide. Democrats say she can’t realistically be a statewide Florida candidate — especially in a potentially contested primary — and fully serve the party at the same time. One Democrat said she could make the decision to leave the DNC no later than April.  Unlike many in Obama’s orbit, Wasserman Schultz has the aura of a Clinton-machine Democrat. She was Hillary Clinton’s co-chair for her 2008 race. Some Democrats have accused her of being disloyal to Clinton toward the end of the contest against Obama, but others say the relationship between the two women is strong.  Wasserman Schultz wouldn’t comment on the chatter. “My only focus right now is serving the people of Florida’s 23rd District in Congress and electing the 45th President of the United States,” she said in a statement.  Florida has had only one female U.S. senator, Republican Paula Hawkins, who served from 1981-87.  Some Democrats are salivating at the prospect of a history-making, two-woman top-of-the-ticket race in Florida. They also hope a female Senate candidate would attract unmarried female voters, who tend to vote Democrat but disproportionately avoid voting in Florida midterms along with African-Americans and Hispanics.  Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 3.6 percentage points in Florida, yet the GOP controls the four statewide elected offices based in Tallahassee, one U.S. Senate seat, a supermajority in the state House and a majority in the state Senate — and that’s despite an anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendment voters approved in 2010.  Presidential election years are much kinder to Florida Democrats: Obama won the state twice, and Sen. Bill Nelson was easily reelected in 2012.  Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz | M. Scott Mahaskey  Wasserman Schultz’s supporters first whispered about her as a possible Senate pick during the 2012 cycle. Many wanted Nelson to run for governor and, if he won, to pick Wasserman Schultz as his replacement an appointment, however, that could have been disputed under Florida law.  The buzz died down as Crist’s candidacy surged, but it’s back now that Democrats believe Rubio is more serious about not seeking reelection if he pursues a White House run. Under state law, Rubio would have to choose which office to pursue.  Follow @politico  Rubio hasn’t completely pledged to not seek reelection if he runs for president. But he has almost shut the door on the possibility.  “If I’m running for president, I’m running for president,” Rubio told POLITICO. “That wouldn’t be my strategy or my thought or my plan. My plan would be to run for president to win.”  Rubio said he has no favored potential successor: “I think we have a deep bench of quality candidates. I’m sure a good one will be our nominee and will win it. I haven’t made that decision. But I anticipate when you are running for president, you have your hands full.”  A number of Republicans want more assurances before they start up plans to run. Among the possible GOP candidates: state CFO Jeff Atwater, former House Speaker Will Weatherford, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and U.S. Reps. Ron DeSantis and Vern Buchanan.  As for the Democrats, aside from Wasserman Schultz, Murphy and Crist, Miami Beach Mayor Phil Levine, independently wealthy and a friend of the Clintons, hasn’t tamped down speculation about his potential interest. Nor has U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch of Boca Raton.  Most top Florida Democrats say that Wasserman Schultz would be tough to beat because of her high name recognition and fundraising prowess. Top-tier Florida campaigns cost at least $10 million. Gov. Rick Scott spent the most, about $115 million in 2014, to defeat Crist by just 1.08 percentage points.  Wasserman Schultz’s post at the DNC has both pluses and minuses for a potential Senate candidacy. While she has greatly expanded her fundraising contact list and media profile, she also could be perceived as too much of a liberal partisan in conservative and moderate quarters of Florida.  “I hear from many people she is interested. I think her problem will be the notion of statewide,” Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, an Obama donor, said by email. “She is very safe and popular inside her district but coming out from there will be a problem in my opinion. As chair of the DNC you are the attack dog for the party. It’s your job. You become polarizing.”  Morgan employs Crist in his law firm and said the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat’s pollster, John Anzalone, has indicated that Crist might seek the Senate seat. Anzalone also polled for a medical-marijuana initiative Morgan underwrote in 2014, when it fell about 3 percentage points shy of the needed 60 percent voter-approval threshold for a state constitutional amendment.  Morgan and Wasserman Schultz had a public falling out over medical marijuana when he blasted her as an “irrelevant … irritant” once she echoed conservative criticisms of the initiative.  Medical marijuana isn’t the only surprisingly conservative position for the otherwise liberal congresswoman. For years, Wasserman Schultz has voted with most Republicans and against most Democrats in favor of keeping a hard line against Cuba’s Castro dictatorship. After Obama announced his plan to normalize relations, Wasserman Schultz’s statement was markedly delayed and tepid.  U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson spoke highly of Wasserman Schultz — even though he is eyeing a 2016 Senate bid as well.  “I would not run against Debbie Wasserman Schultz out of respect and admiration for her,” Grayson said in an interview. “She would be almost impossible to beat in a Democratic primary anyway.”  Grayson said he believed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, should he go ahead with a presidential bid in 2016, would have “coattails” for a Republican candidate in Florida, making it all the better to have a ticket led by Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, who bests Bush by inside-the-error-margin amounts in early Florida polls.  Asked if Wasserman Schultz were seriously considering a run, Grayson said “yes.” When asked whether the two had spoken about the matter, Grayson said he wouldn’t disclose private conversations.  The prospect of a Wasserman Schultz-Murphy primary for Senate could pit the two camps of the Florida Democratic Party against each other: Those who argue for a more centrist approach side with Murphy, and those who favor a candidacy that doesn’t shy away from liberalism are more in Wasserman Schultz’s camp.  The potentially open Senate seat puts Florida Democrats like Steve Schale in a tough spot. Schale, a fan of both Murphy and Wasserman Schultz, served as an adviser to Crist and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, who intends to run for reelection to her 2nd District seat.  Schale said some have dismissed the idea of Wasserman Schultz running, but they might be surprised.  “She’s considering [the] Senate far more seriously than many people are giving her credit for,” Schale said.

The Trump campaign is contesting election results in several states due to massive voter fraud and irregularities so Republican Electors are stepping up and casting procedural votes to preserve the legal challenges.  Crooked Secretaries of State in Georgia and Pennsylvania certified false election results in favor of Joe Biden.  Republican Electors in Georgia and Pennsylvania on Monday cast procedural votes for President and Vice President to preserve the Trump campaign’s legal challenges.  Georgia GOP Chairman David Shafer said, “Because the President’s lawsuit contesting the Georgia election is still pending, the Republican nominees for Presidential Elector met today at noon at the State Capitol today and cast their votes for President and Vice President.”  “Had we not meet today and cast our votes, the President’s pending election contest would have been effectively mooted.

While Democrat legal challenges were pending, Democratic presidential electors met to cast a conditional vote for John F. Kennedy to preserve their intent in the event of future favorable legal outcomes,” the Pennsylvania GOP said in a statement.  “The conditional resolution states that electors certify their vote for the President and Vice President “on the understanding that if, as a result of a final non-appealable Court Order or other proceeding prescribed by law, [they] are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Pennsylvania.”  https://twitter.com/PAGOP/status/1338550681758740480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1338550681758740480%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com%2F2020%2F12%2Frepublican-electors-georgia-pennsylvania-cast-procedural-votes-president-vice-president-preserve-trump-camp-legal-challenges%2F",PENNSLYVANIA JOINS GEORGIA AND NEVADA ELECTORS TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP,FALSE
5d8daa18,"A worker with the Detroit Department of Elections carries empty boxes used to organize absentee ballots after nearing the end of the absentee ballot count at the Central Counting Board in the TCF Center in Detroit, Mich., on Nov. 4, 2020. Elaine Cromie/Getty Images  More Than 10,000 Dead People Cast Ballots in Michigan, Analysis Shows  More than 10,000 people confirmed or suspected dead have returned their mail-in ballots to vote in Michigan, according to an analysis of the state’s election data.  About 9,500 voters confirmed dead through the Social Security Death Index SSDI are marked in the state’s mail voting database as having returned ballots. Another nearly 2,000 are 100 years old or more and aren’t listed as known living centenarians.  The analysis was provided by Richard Baris, director of Big Data Poll.  The data indicates that somebody else was trying to vote on behalf of these people.  “It’s also entirely possible that some of them aren’t even real people,” Baris told The Epoch Times via email. “If someone is 110 or some ridiculous age, we should have their death record but do not.”  Americans older than 110 are exceedingly rare; only a handful of such seniors are known to live in Michigan.  According to the 2010 Census, there were 1,729 centenarians in Michigan pdf.  Even if somebody tried to vote on behalf of a deceased person, the vote would be rejected, according to Tracy Wimmer, spokeswoman for the Michigan secretary of state.  “Ballots of voters who have died are rejected in Michigan, even if the voter cast an absentee ballot and then died before Election Day,” she previously told The Epoch Times via email.  However, Baris isn’t convinced.  “While I’m open to the idea some of these have been rejected, I’m not open to any outright dismissal they all were rejected,” he said in a Nov. 8 tweet.  The data on how many ballots were rejected isn’t available yet, Wimmer said.  She said that “a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead.”  “This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr., when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr., or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file.”  This only happens “on rare occasions,” she said.  Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads in Michigan by less than 150,000 votes. The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Michigan to halt vote counting until Republican observers are granted adequate access. The GOP-led Michigan legislature is investigating allegations of election irregularities in the state.  In a Nov. 9 lawsuit, a Detroit poll watcher alleged thousands of mail-in ballots from people who weren’t properly registered to vote were added to vote counts.  Poll operators were adding names and addresses to the poll book with made-up birth dates, such as 1/1/1900, he said in a sworn affidavit.  Baris said the mail voting data he worked from likely isn’t up to date enough to capture any irregularities that happened Election Day and after.  “If they did that on Election Day in Michigan, then we likely wouldn’t know until December,” he said. “If it is true, then they’d, unfortunately, get away with it in the short-term.”  President Donald Trump is challenging the results of the elections in several states where Biden holds a tight lead. The Trump campaign is alleging invalid ballots were counted for Democrats, valid ballots were thrown away for Republicans, and Republican ballot watchers were prevented from meaningfully observing the vote-counting process.","More Than 10,000 Dead People Cast Ballots in Michigan, Analysis Shows",FALSE
08bcc604,"George Osborne has urged progressive MPs in the Labour party to back his welfare changes in a critical Commons vote on Monday night, saying they should recognise that the proposals not only chime with the public but build on mainstream Labour thinking.  Writing in the Guardian, the chancellor calls on Labour to stop blaming the public for its defeat and recognise that welfare requires public consent.  Labour has plunged into a deep, week-long split over how to respond to Osborne’s welfare plans, with at least three of the leadership candidates, including Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper, rejecting the interim Labour leader Harriet Harman’s plea for the party to abstain and back a lower welfare cap. Harman also said Labour should not oppose the restriction of tax credits to a claimant’s first two children.  She said the party needed to recognise that the electorate had sent Labour a message on welfare and it had to show it was listening. But she has now been forced into a partial retreat, and the party has instead tabled an amendment rejecting the bill. Some Labour MPs still believe the new compromise does not go far enough and will vote against the bill on Monday, not just support a dissenting amendment.  Osborne sprung a surprise in the budget by proposing cuts to the level of tax credits, but balanced these in part by a rise in the minimum wage to more than £9 an hour by 2020 for those over 25. Osborne argues that the responsibility for ensuring decent living standards should be rebalanced from the state handing out subsidies towards employers providing decent wages.  He writes: “Three in four people – and a majority of Labour voters – think that Britain spends too much on welfare. For our social contract to work, we need to retain the consent of the taxpayer, not just the welfare recipient. For those that can work, I believe it is better to earn a higher income from your work than receive a higher income from welfare.  “I thought British politics had taken a step forward when Labour’s acting leader Harriet Harman indicated that she would support at least some of our reforms. She recognised that oppositions only advance when they stop blaming the public for their defeat and recognise that some of the arguments made by political opponents should be listened to – just as a previous Conservative opposition realised 15 years ago when it accepted the case for a minimum wage.  “Depressingly, the Labour leader has been forced to retreat from her sensible position after Len McCluskey accused her of ‘running up the white flag’ and leadership candidates Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper joined Jeremy Corbyn in undermining her. With the vote coming on Monday, I urge moderate Labour MPs not to make the same mistake as in the last parliament, when they refused to support each and every welfare reform we proposed. I say: vote with us.”  Helen Goodman MP, who tabled an amendment to block the welfare bill without consent from the party’s leadership, told the Today programme on Monday that she hoped the Labour leadership hopefuls would vote against the bill if Harman’s motion didn’t succeed.  “Having pointed out what’s wrong with the bill it seems to me only logical, if her motion doesn’t succeed ... that we vote against the bill in its entirety.”  Goodman rejected Osborne’s claim that Labour voters had supported the government’s proposed welfare cuts.    “I don’t think George Osborne is quite right about this,” she said. “Throughout the election campaign the Tories refused to say where their £12bn worth of cuts were going to come from. They did that precisely because they had these ideas in the back of their mind and they knew they would be deeply unpopular with the British people, and that they would lose votes if they revealed them.”  Osborne insisted his stance represented the new centre ground of politics and called on progressive MPs to join the Conservatives in the lobby.    He said: “Because we’re requiring all employers by law to pay the national living wage, we can rein in the tax credit system that has subsidised low wages for too long.”  The proposals are part of a common endeavour by Labour and the Conservatives to implement difficult welfare reforms, he says.  Osborne adds: “To their credit, New Labour work and pensions secretaries such as John Hutton, David Blunkett and James Purnell all tried to reform the welfare system. Now Alistair Darling says tax credits are ‘subsidising lower wages in a way that was never intended’. And Frank Field, elected by all MPs to be the new chair of the work and pensions committee, agrees the system as it stands is simply ‘not sustainable’ and the budget represents a ‘game-changer’. That’s because, working closely with my colleague Iain Duncan Smith, those long-held aspirations for genuine welfare reform are being delivered.”  He points out that Blunkett had described the previous welfare system as “crackers”. The tax credit system had become unsustainable, Osborne said, adding: “It can’t be right that a tax credits system Gordon Brown said would cost just over £1bn in its first year ended up costing £30bn, with payments being made to nine in every 10 families with children.”  Osborne’s warning to Labour not to forget the principle of taxpayer consent came as the party’s leadership candidates continued to scrap over how to respond to the welfare changes.  Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics, which hosted a debate between the candidates, Burnham explained why he led the revolt over Harman’s plan not to oppose the government’s welfare bill: “I believe tax credits are one of the biggest and best things we did, because they support people in work and get people into work. The problem with George Osborne’s budget is it diminished those work incentives and it isn’t going to do what he claims he is doing.”  Liz Kendall, who has been described as the Blairite candidate, challenged Burnham and Cooper to explain how their stance on welfare differed from the one that helped Labour lose the election.  Burnham said he supported the principle of a benefits cap, and Cooper said she backed a universal childcare system. She said: “That’s what we should be doing. That would help far more people into work.”  The Labour manifesto had contained backing for a welfare cap, but plans for a universal childcare system were blocked by Ed Miliband largely on grounds of cost.  Kendall said: “I don’t want to see child tax credits cut from poor and low-paid families. But I thought that Harriet Harman was right to say to us as a party that we’ve lost the election and one of the big reasons why was people didn’t trust us on welfare. And if we keep saying and doing the things we’ve done over the past five years over the next five years, we will get the same result. So I want to support and back Harriet for raising a very difficult issue for us as a party.”",George Osborne calls on Labour MPs to back welfare changes in Commons vote,partially false
fba6d4c5,"To say out-loud that you find the results of the 2020 presidential election odd is to invite derision. You must be a crank or a conspiracy theorist. Mark me down as a crank, then. I am a pollster and I find this election to be deeply puzzling. I also think that the Trump campaign is still well within its rights to contest the tabulations. Something very strange happened in America’s democracy in the early hours of Wednesday November 4 and the days that followed. It’s reasonable for a lot of Americans to want to find out exactly what.  First, consider some facts. President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent seeking reelection. He got 11 million more votes than in 2016, the third largest rise in support ever for an incumbent. By way of comparison, President Obama was comfortably reelected in 2012 with 3.5 million fewer votes than he received in 2008.  Trump’s vote increased so much because, according to exit polls, he performed far better with many key demographic groups. Ninety-five percent of Republicans voted for him. He did extraordinarily well with rural male working-class whites.  Trump grew his support among black voters by 50 percent over 2016. Nationally, Joe Biden’s black support fell well below 90 percent, the level below which Democratic presidential candidates usually lose.  Trump increased his share of the national Hispanic vote to 35 percent. With 60 percent or less of the national Hispanic vote, it is arithmetically impossible for a Democratic presidential candidate to win Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. Bellwether states swung further in Trump’s direction than in 2016. Florida, Ohio and Iowa each defied America’s media polls with huge wins for Trump. Since 1852, only Richard Nixon has lost the Electoral College after winning this trio, and that 1960 defeat to John F. Kennedy is still the subject of great suspicion.  Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump’s direction. Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden’s ‘winning’ margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities, as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. He did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.  We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.  Victorious presidential candidates, especially challengers, usually have down-ballot coattails; Biden did not. The Republicans held the Senate and enjoyed a ‘red wave’ in the House, where they gained a large number of seats while winning all 27 toss-up contests. Trump’s party did not lose a single state legislature and actually made gains at the state level.  Another anomaly is found in the comparison between the polls and non-polling metrics. The latter include: party registrations trends; the candidates’ respective primary votes; candidate enthusiasm; social media followings; broadcast and digital media ratings; online searches; the number of especially small donors; and the number of individuals betting on each candidate.  Despite poor recent performances, media and academic polls have an impressive 80 percent record predicting the winner during the modern era. But, when the polls err, non-polling metrics do not; the latter have a 100 percent record. Every non-polling metric forecast Trump’s reelection. For Trump to lose this election, the mainstream polls needed to be correct, which they were not. Furthermore, for Trump to lose, not only did one or more of these metrics have to be wrong for the first time ever, but every single one had to be wrong, and at the very same time; not an impossible outcome, but extremely unlikely nonetheless.  Atypical voting patterns married with misses by polling and non-polling metrics should give observers pause for thought. Adding to the mystery is a cascade of information about the bizarre manner in which so many ballots were accumulated and counted.  The following peculiarities also lack compelling explanations:  1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers  2. Statistically abnormal vote counts were the new normal when counting resumed. They were unusually large in size hundreds of thousands and had an unusually high 90 percent and above Biden-to-Trump ratio  3. Late arriving ballots were counted. In Pennsylvania, 23,000 absentee ballots have impossible postal return dates and another 86,000 have such extraordinary return dates they raise serious questions  4. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots. The destruction of mail-in ballot envelopes, which must contain signatures  5. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’  6. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing  7. Non-resident voters. Matt Braynard’s Voter Integrity Project estimates that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia. Biden’s margin is 12,670 votes",Reasons why the 2020 presidential election is deeply puzzling,other

The language, added by Pelosi and Schumer, was very clear of its intention:  “The passing of this legislative package will also outlaw the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in all schools in the United States. This statute will go into effect immediately upon this bill’s passage. Anyone found guilty of reciting the Pledge will be charged with grand heresy, and punished by up to 10 years in a federal penitentiary and a fine of no less than $20,000.”  Republicans Senator Joe Barron slammed the news:  “Democrats bad, Republicans good. It’s really that simple. Everything is simple like that in life.”  The Democrats thought they were sneaky, adding this nonsense into the aid bill. The Republicans were too smart, however, and the foolish Democrat plot was foiled. Republicans are a party of literacy and read they did. They read the bill in its entirety to check for traps like this laid by the Democrats.  It’s also a sad state of affairs that the Democrats would use such a bill, one for emergency relief, to push their leftist communist agenda.

Nearly 1,600 people – who have long since passed on – are still on the voter rolls. How ridiculous is that?

8172bb79,"I know firsthand what it's like to experience discrimination simply because of who you are. Fifty years ago, I was a little girl who got scolded by a teacher for speaking Spanish during recess. I also know that those sentiments are not indicative of who we are as San Antonians.  That's why I'm hopeful the San Antonio City Council will pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or veterans' status. These common-sense updates also ensure fair treatment in housing and public accommodations and will bring San Antonio in line with the codes of cities such as Dallas, Fort Worth, and Austin. But, they'll also make sure our city's laws reflect our city's values.  I was fortunate, in an age when women weren't always allowed the same opportunities as men, to have parents who convinced me that I could do anything. As an educator, my mother pushed me academically. And, whenever people would comment to my father that I was pretty, he would reply, “She's the smartest in her class.” These are values our city should promote — ensuring equal access to opportunities based on dedication and talent, not on who we love or who we are.  With respect to those who have come before us, we know that change is constant. The image of Texas is of cowboys — vaqueros — fighting to tame a wild frontier. But now we have a 21st century powerhouse economy. Our small-town past steadily changed into a high-rise present — and today, six of the 20 largest cities in the United States are right here in Texas.  We'll continue to change — I believe for the better. I can't think of any better time in history to be living in Texas than right now. Texans have always boasted that this is a land of opportunity, and this has never been truer than today.  As chairwoman of the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, I was blessed to meet Staff Sergeant Eric Alva. In 2003, this San Antonio native became the first Marine to be seriously injured in the Iraq War, when he stepped on a land mine and lost his right leg.  He fought for us. He fought for you. He very nearly died for our country, and still suffers for it every day. And yet, here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay. It's not right that a man who fought to protect this country is not protected at home — that a man who loves his country is discriminated against because of who he loves.  Updating the city's non-discrimination ordinance acknowledges the importance of ensuring that all members of our community are treated with fairness and dignity. Together we can make this possible, together we will erase harmful inequalities that threaten our city's quality of life.  Thankfully, I will not have to stand alone, because San Antonians are with us. We all know and respect people like Eric.",City Council should pass human-rights ordinance,partially false
6c5d1fe3,"Federal election officials from the USA Department of Justice have swarmed to Erie, Pennsylvania, where a trash bag full of ballots has reportedly appeared floating just offshore.  Lead election investigator, Joe Barron, says the find could have been one of the most significant towards proving Trump’s election fraud claims had it worked out.  Sadly, what they recovered was so damaged by the water that there was no way to determine what was in the bag without a full forensic analysis, which was performed by the FBI.  According to that report, the contents of the bag were most definitely ballots, but the hard part of the investigation was just beginning:  “The bag contained more than 3000 ballots. That we know for sure. What we don’t know is who cast them or whether they would change the outcome of the election. “There’s a lot more work to do.”  The Department of Homeland Security has taken custody of the ballots and the US Marshals are keeping watch over them. A high-ranking official inside the Treasury Department says he’s not sure what all the fuss is about:  “Yeah, the problem is, they aren’t being very honest about the whole thing. The bag is full of ballots, sure, but they’re ballots for last season’s finale of The Voice. We’re pretty sure that show has never actually had a real winner, so…why all the hubbub? “It’s pretty silly, really.”  President Trump released a statement declaring the entire election in Pennsylvania a wash and laid claim to the 20 electoral votes, as is his right under an executive he signed a few minutes earlier.  “President Trump says the message is clear,” said a pal, “if you can alter something as secure as an election on a popular TV show, then the whole system is in question.

244152ed,"Kamala Harris was caught on a hot mic during an interview trashing patriotic Trump voters — the backbone of this great country!  Her exact words:  “These people are idiots. They know nothing except for bumper sticker slogans and they’re pretty gross too.”  These are words from the Vice Presidential candidate of the United States of America. Our president or Vice President would never even think to say such things.  The statement was made during a speech during a Black Lives Matter protest, where she was to address the crowd. Conservatives who happened to be in the crowd for a counter-protest were horrified and disgusted by what she said.  They said she pretty much gave them the stink eye as well, completely denigrating them as they were nothing.  “It was unbelievable!” said patriot Sandy Batt, who was in the crowd. “She said it, I don’t think she realized it, but if she did, she just shooed us off!”  Batt exclaimed, just shocked and in disbelief at what she had just heard.  “It’s like she’s calling us stupid!”  Mind you Ms. Batt’s sign was full of grammatical errors and she was waving a Gadsden Flag and a Thin Blue Line flag, apparently not realizing they cancel each other out.  Another attendee, Joe Barron, couldn’t stop laughing at the counter-protesters when he saw the shock grow across their stupid faces.  “Well, Trump did say he loves the poorly educated, these people should be embracing their proud stupidity!”  Other Trump supporters just looked confused and dumbfounded, pretty much like they usually do.  Why anyone would be even the littlest bit offended by this is beyond me. Trump has been saying pretty vile things since he first ran for president in 2015.  The clutching pearls crowd will be just fine, as they are poorly educated and hate anything that makes them look bad, except for themselves. Oh the irony.

7e8aedbe,"A Mississippi man who was sold to a traveling circus at the age of three in 1993 by his mother has been ordered by the court to pay back the sum of $1,2 million dollars before he can get his freedom back.  Jared Arnold, 28, was sold in 1993 to the owner of Circus Magicus, Todd Bentley, by his mother Tamara Lee Arnold.  The contract specified at the time that M. Bentley took legal ownership of Jared until his 21st birthday, after which he would have to pay all expenses for which Circus Magicus had taken care of and thus would be set free from his contract.  “He just has to repay what he cost us for the first 21 years of his life and he’s free to go” Circus Magicus owner, Todd Bentley told reporters.  “I understand my mother had addiction problems at the time and M. Bentley possibly saved my life, but at a wage of 9 dollars an hour, I’ll be shoveling elephant shit for the next 53 years if I have to repay this debt,” Arnold said in court.  Jared Arnold first recalled the many jobs he had during his 20 years with the circus, of which he left five years ago at the age of 23.  “I first dressed up as a midget, then I learned to juggle with fire and explosives before I burned myself and eventually became an acrobat. A back injury left me paralyzed when I fell from 30 feet high up in the air and these are the hospital bills I am still paying today,” he explained in court.  A number of injuries led Jared’s adoptive father, Todd Bentley, to pay for over $585,769 in hospital fees over the past eight years.  Judge Andrew Neil told Arnold that the contract was clear and legal according to Mississippi laws at the time and that “it was only fair” that he would pay back his hospital bills and living fees since M. Bentley was not his biological father and agreed, upon certain terms, to take full responsibility for the young infant at the time.  Judge Neil also allowed the defendant to keep his job as a Starbucks barista, where he presently works, to pay off his debt towards Circus Magicus explaining that as long as he paid back his debt he could work “wherever he wanted.”  Arnold’s lawyer pleaded the judge to reduce his client’s debt, claiming that at his current wage it would take the defendant over 28 years to pay back his debt but the demand was swiftly denied by the judge.",Mississippi man who was legally sold to Circus as a baby ‘still owned by company’ says court judge,FALSE

6612a10d,"Deliveroo couriers have demanded union recognition and employment rights and are set to take legal action if the company rejects their request.  The news comes after a landmark ruling in October stated Uber drivers are employees, not self-employed as the company had claimed. The judgment could entitle thousands of “gig economy” workers to holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage.  The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain IWGB has demanded recognition from Deliveroo so that the union can bargain for pay and conditions on workers’ behalf. The deal will initially cover Camden in north London and will be rolled out nationwide if successful.  Recommended Read more Uber ordered to pay drivers minimum wage in landmark case  If half of drivers in the area sign up, Deliveroo will be forced to recognise the union. It will be the first collective bargaining agreement in the “gig economy”, setting a precedent for others to demand further rights.  Deliveroo has 10 business days to respond, after which an application will be submitted to the Central Arbitration Committee CAC asking it to force Deliveroo into collective bargaining.  IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: “Of course, for the CAC to entertain our request they will need to decide that Deliveroo drivers are ‘workers’ and not the ‘independent contractors’ you have bogusly deemed them to be,” Moyer-Lee said.  “Deliveroo drivers work for Deliveroo and as such they should be entitled to paid holiday, minimum wage, trade union rights, and all the other rights associated with worker status.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our privacy notice  Experts said the case could be hugely significant. Aaron Hayward, employment specialist at DJM Solicitors said it was “no surprise” the drivers were taking action after the Uber case.“The explosion of the gig economy means many thousands of workers across the UK are now engaged in temporary, casual work that doesn’t entitle them to paid holiday, minimum wage and other rights, because they are officially classified as ‘contractors’,” he said.  If the drivers are successful, Deliveroo will be the “first app-based employer to recognise a union in the UK. First they must succeed in convincing a tribunal that drivers should be reclassified as employees as opposed to contractors as collective bargaining laws only apply to employees.  “This is an employment case that employers, workers and lawyers alike will be watching with interest. As we move more towards a ‘gig economy’ based on short-term, software-driven casual work, this issue isn’t going to away anytime soon.”  Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants which do not have their own delivery service such as Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.  Drivers receive £3.75 per delivery under a new pilot scheme, but some have allege they wait up to an hour for a delivery, meaning their take-home pay is less than minimum wage. This is legal if the workers are self-employed, but many say it amounts to exploitation.

203e3285,"UPDATE 9:45P ET » Florida Gov. DeSantis confirms coronavirus outbreak in state.  A Sarasota hospital has “activated all protocols for handling potential COVID-19 cases,” it said in a letter to its patients and staff. The letter, obtained by Your Content, is dated March 1, 2020 and confirms the hospital is now on red alert following a CDC notification that a patient has tested positive in their building.  According to a source who was briefed on the entire situation, a total at least three but possibly as many as 8 individuals have been exposed. However, that figure does not include individuals that might’ve contracted the virus prior to the patient’s initial arrival, the source says.  “We’ve been asked to stay silent on the issue until the CDC has time to assess the damages,” the source said, speaking only under the condition of anonymity.  Tomorrow I will be in Tampa and Miami with Surgeon General Rivkees and other officials to discuss our continued statewide response on #COVID19. https://t.co/sMrWkQlyoi — Ron DeSantis @GovRonDeSantis March 2, 2020  “I could confirm there are at least three individuals being placed under extreme care — one remains in isolation and has tested positive for the coronavirus.”  The source noted they are awaiting the results from approximately 8 tests that were subsequently sent out after the patient tested positive.  “Doctors Hospital of Sarosota has been notified by the Centers for Disease Control that we have a patient in our facility who presumptively tested positive for COVID-19,” the release reads. “This patient was admitted to our facility in late February, and remains in our care. On Friday, Feb. 28th, the CDC changed its guidance regarding COVID-19, specifically, the criteria for persons under investigation PUI, which consequently activated all protocols for handling potential COVID-19 cases, including immediate isolation.”  ??: Doctors Hospital of Sarasota Patient for Your Content  “All potentially exposed individuals have been identified. We are working very closely with the local and state departments of health as well as the CDC to assure that we continue to take all appropriate precautions,” the release goes on to say.  Florida has 2 presumptive positive #COVID19 cases: one adult resident of Hillsborough County and one adult resident of Manatee County. Both individuals are isolated and being appropriately cared for. — Florida Dept. Health @HealthyFla March 2, 2020  “Just as we have done with seasonal flu and tuberculosis, we identify and treat infectious diseases while minimizing risk. By being aware of the very latest recommendations of the CDC, Doctors Hospital of Sarosota was able to identify this patient and pursue testing at the very earliest opportunity.”  “Please know that the safety of our patients, colleagues and community is of the utmost concern,” the release declares.  The recent widespread outbreak of the respiratory disease stemmed from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in 60 locations internationally, including in the United States.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  During the week of February 23, CDC reported community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in California in two places, Oregon and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case of COVID-19 in a health care worker, and the first potential outbreak in a long-term care facility.  The CDC affirms that there are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.  How will the coronavirus impact my community?  More cases of the coronavirus are likely to be identified in the coming days, according to the CDC. That includes a rapid increase in cases in the United States. It’s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in communities in the United States. It’s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of the coronavirus in the United States will occur.  Widespread transmission of the coronavirus would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths.

We’re in God’s hands, folks! Liberate America!  Trump Hides CDC Information  The tweet is in response to the all too true story of how the Trump administration attempted to bury guidance on reopening the country for business.  The Associated Press reports.  The Trump administration shelved a document created by the nation’s top disease investigators with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus outbreak. The 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled “Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,” was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen. It was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told the guidance “would never see the light of day,” according to a CDC official. The official was not authorized to talk to reporters and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.  The Future  The public is responding to the story in predictable fashion.

8400483c,"Piles of shredded ballots were located today in a dumpster in Maricopa County Arizona. This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.  For months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election. As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors MCBOS agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission EAC. However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:  The MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:  TRENDING: BREAKING: Supreme Court Dismisses President Trump and Attorney Lin Wood's Final Election Challenge Without Comment  This is probably why these audits were set up the way they were so no fraud would be identified. The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night. These individuals were greeted with a network that was labeled “f##k you”.  And as we reported, the audits were unprofessional in other areas as well:  This is when the Arizona Senate said enough and passed a bill that would grant the Arizona legislature the authority to subpoena election records like ballots and tabulating equipment and ignore any laws to the contrary.  The Senate is now in the process of selecting an auditors to perform their audit. As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.  Per our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.  Today some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.  Someone ordered the ballots be shredded.  We do not yet have the complete information on the shredded ballots.  This is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election. This also occurred in Georgia, another state where Biden won by a very slim margin.  What a mess. The corrupt FBI won’t investigate obvious crimes. The corrupt media won’t report them.

930d0381,"During the predawn hours on New Year’s Day, Delta Force operators infiltrated a Biden-controlled stronghold in southeast Ukraine near the port city of Mariupol, according to an anonymous White House Source who said President Trump greenlit the operation following a series of telephone calls to US military commanders and to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa Japan to the US Embassy in Kyiv and held position there until Trump cleared the incursion with his Ukrainian counterparts.  Reliable sources said the Trump administration had obtained “credible evidence?? that the Biden family, by proxy, owned a 200-acre estate and office building 50km northwest of Mariupol. On paper the property was owned by Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund firm in which the Bidens have controlling interest. In the late summer of 2006 Joe Biden’s son Hunter and Joe’s younger brother, James, bought the firm. On the first day on the job, they showed up with Biden’s other son, Beau, and three large men and fired Paradigm’s president and 95% of staff, according to a Paradigm executive who was present. After that, much of Paradigm’s overseas ventures went dark but continued to rake in hefty profits despite a conspicuous lack of investors.  In June 2009 Washington Free Beacon writer Thomas Breslin opined the following statement: “Paradigm is hardly a reputable company. The Bidens fired everyone and put their own people in place. The company became nothing less than a slush fund for illicit monies that the Bidens laundered through the place.??  The Trump administration has spent four years ferreting out the truth behind Paradigm Global Advisors, according to our White House informant.  “After years of digging, Trump finally caught a break. A current Paradigm employee—someone the Biden’s fucked over—came forward with enough evidence for Trump to make this move. I don’t know what specific evidence was presented, but it must have been some heavy-hitting stuff for Trump to call on Delta to take care of it.??  At 3am on New Year’s Day, three Blackhawk helicopters, including decoy aircraft, airlifted Delta from Kyiv to the drop zone. The team found the office building empty, devoid of life. The unit commander described the building as “frigid,?? as if it had been vacant and without heat for a long time.  “The windows were covered in a hoarfrost glaze, and the place had a catacomb chill about it,?? he was quoted as saying. “Every office had been stripped—no chairs, no desks, no computers, no nothing. No electricity.??  Although the building was long deserted, Delta found evidence of recent activity within the hacienda attached to the compound. In a kitchen were freshly chopped vegetables and a percolator of lukewarm coffee. Outside, fresh tire impressions led away from the compound. It was as if someone had tipped off the occupants.  But in the hacienda Delta hit paydirt. They seized several laptops and 300 million dollars in gold bullion. They also found crates of Chinese-manufactured Type 56 assault rifles and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Even more disturbing, they found beneath the hacienda a maze of chambers and tunnels that ran for miles in every direction. Ankle and wrist shackles, bolted to the walls in various locations, held bits of necrotic flesh, and in an antechamber, they discovered twelve duffel bags filled with black tar heroin.  On Trump’s order, Delta coordinated with Ukraine’s SBU, that nation’s security agency in counterintelligence and combatting terrorism, to confiscate evidence and await the arrival of State Department personnel.

4304b695,"Latest Breaking News: Martial Law Imminent General David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps., refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to use the Corps. to safeguard Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration from Trump supporters and insurrectionists. A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night. Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office. Her statement made the general explode, our source said. “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said. Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress. “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi. Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.” Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.” Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order. “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen.

7559d493,"Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responds to questioning on the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2013. Credit: Jason Reed / Reuters  By  Fifteen months ago, I asked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton why she hadn't simply picked up the phone and talked to the Benghazi survivors to find out what had actually happened. Instead of being straightforward, she deflected this uncomfortable question with a now-infamous question of her own: What difference, at this point, does it make?  The answer to that question and the motive behind this administration's lies and coverup are finally becoming quite clear. The belated release of a Sept. 14, 2012, talking points email from deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes proves that senior White House officials were fully engaged in directing the coverup and perpetuating the lies.  According to the Rhodes email, the goal of the administration's Benghazi spin was to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy. This was in spite of the fact that within hours of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack, the administration knew — or certainly should have known — there was no protest.  So why did the administration lie to America?  Because the truth would have damaged President Barack Obama's re-election chances and further revealed Clinton's dereliction of duty that contributed to the unnecessary deaths of four brave Americans. She fully understood her culpability in the Benghazi tragedy, which is why she reacted so testily to my reasonable line of questioning.  The outrages surrounding the Benghazi attack involve administration action, or lack of action, before, during and after the attack.  The greatest outrages occurred before the attack. The State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security but instead actually reduced security in Libya. Although no one can say with certainty, I firmly believe a relatively small contingent of armed military guards would have prevented the attack, and those four lives would not have been lost.  The outrageous act of omission during the attack was that no additional defensive or offensive military assets were immediately dispatched to help the endangered personnel in Benghazi. Although it is true that no intervention to save the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens or diplomat Sean Smith was possible, I do not believe the same can be said with certainty concerning U.S. personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who also were killed that night.  No one could know with certainty that the survivors would be able to get to the airport and be safely evacuated within 12 hours. What if they had encountered resistance en route to the airport? There were military assets in Croatia that could have arrived within the 12-hour window it took the survivors to reach safety. Didn't the administration feel obligated to deploy every asset available until the moment the survivors were safe?  Finally, there are the outrageous lies and coverups after the attack. There were many, but I want to concentrate on one: Clinton's comments to Woods' father at the moment she should have been demonstrating only genuine compassion.  Imagine yourself in her role, honoring the remains of four brave Americans who had given their lives for their country. Would you have taken that moment to offer sincere condolences and to grieve with the families? Or would you have seized the opportunity to plant and perpetuate the coverup of your dereliction of duty?  In the words of Woods' father, Clinton did the latter: Hillary Clinton came up to me and I gave her a handshake and a hug, and when I shook her hand, she said to me, 'We are going to have the filmmaker arrested.' Even at that time, she was trying to place a spin on what happened.  What difference does it make? I'll let my fellow Americans judge for themselves.

50efae0c,"Press Release via Competitive Elections Wisconsin.  Open Letter to Rep. Robin Vos, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly  Speaker Vos,  Wisconsin’s legislature suffers from a serious deficit of democracy. Thanks to restrictive and anti-competitive ballot laws, almost half of Representatives 47 out of 99 were the only name on the ballot in the November 2014 general election. That’s half of voters who got no debate, no discussion, no choice- no real election at all. A similarly large number of races were uncontested in the August primary. In the 12th Assembly District, I was one of many who had no choice in either the primary or the general election.  This is compared to just 9 out of 134 Representatives who ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties. It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are.  Voters are, in fact, viscerally disgusted when they go to the polls only to find that their time has been wasted with slates of unopposed candidates. So why do our State Assembly elections look more like the selection of a Soviet Politburo or House of Lords than a freely-elected American state legislature?  The problem is simple. For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high. These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it. This is often couched in terms of “serious candidates only” – a decision that is surely for voters to make.  This policy harms voters by denying them a debate and a choice, but it also wastes taxpayer resources as the Government Accountability Board scrambles to scrutinize tens of thousands of signatures by statutory deadlines. This process, where candidates are invited to try to kick each other off the ballot based on technicalities, serves no legitimate public interest. The argument against an overcrowded ballot strains credulity in the face of severely under-crowded ballots.  A simple and obvious measure which could be taken to help fix this problem, before the 2016 election, would be to reduce the number of signatures required on nomination petitions by half, across the board. This would bring Wisconsin in line with the norm in neighboring states, and greatly reduce the number of uncontested elections. Such a modest reform would also not require any other substantive changes to the structure of Wisconsin’s election laws.  All voters should demand free, open, fair, and competitive elections, where all ideas can be heard and considered as part of our civic discourse. Citizens who wish to engage in the democratic process as candidates, should not face unreasonable barriers to entry. Any legislator who ran unopposed in 2014 should be challenged to support this necessary change, as should all Representatives who value the integrity and legitimacy of Wisconsin’s elections. I urge you to give this proposal serious consideration, before Wisconsin has a State Assembly where an outright majority of Representatives were not meaningfully “elected” at all.

e92ede13,"We do not condone cheating under any circumstances. Academic achievement can never be separated from academic integrity, which is why the Georgia Federation of Teachers was the first whistle-blower to expose Atlanta testing irregularities.  Tragically, the Atlanta cheating scandal harmed our children and it crystallizes the unintended consequences of our test-crazed policies. Standardized tests have a role in accountability, but today they dominate everything else and too often don't even correlate to what students need to know to succeed.  No amount of testing will replace what works to improve teaching and learning: giving teachers the resources and tools they need to be great teachers and providing students with a rich and well-rounded curriculum. Covering up kids' academic deficiencies cheats students out of the targeted help they deserve.  It is outrageous that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing. We have to re-order our priorities and move our schools from a test-based culture to one that is deeply rooted in instruction and learning, so that our kids can become engaged participants in the knowledge economy and our democracy.  School districts in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere placed enormous pressure on teachers to show improved scores, but the hard truth is that cheating on high-stakes testing doesn't fix public schools or help kids. And even with this intense pressure, the vast majority of teachers do everything they can to help kids and never succumb to cheating. They know there are no shortcuts to success. Moving the needle requires a balanced approach that focuses on high-quality instruction; a rich curriculum; appropriate and useful assessments; and additional help and other resources like tutoring, after-school activities and social services to enable teachers and students to be successful.","Randi Weingarten, Teachers Union Head, Sounds Off On Atlanta Cheating Scandal",partially false

ffd139b7,"OFFICIAL INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS RECORDS RELEASED  Sealed and guarded since the end of WWII at Arolsen, Germany, the Official IRC records reveal the actual Concentration Camp total death toll was 271,301  For years, people around the world – “the West” in particular – have been told that “six million Jews were systematically murdered by Germans in ‘Concentration Camps’ during World War 2.”  Thousands of honest people disputing this claim have been viciously smeared as a hateful anti-Semite. Several countries around the world have jailed and heavily fined people for disputing the claim that “6 Million” Jews were killed.  Provided here is a scanned image of an Official International Red Cross document, proving the so-called “Holocaust” [the long-and-often-claimed-6-million Jews] is just plain wrong. Jews around the world have intentionally exaggerated and perpetually lied for the purpose of gaining political, emotional and business advantages for themselves.  They committed willful, criminal FRAUD upon millions of trusting people around the world!  Please NOTE that the truth has been known since long before 1979! The above compiler, replying to a letter, had to rely on information that was already in existence!  Tax-payers of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Latvia, Poland and other nations have had multiple millions of dollars taken from their wages to be paid out to “holocaust survivors” and their descendants for something that DID NOT HAPPEN.  The tax-payers of these United States of America spend Billion$ each year in direct, indirect and military support of the State of Israel which is not Biblical Israel.  This is intentional, criminal fraud on a scale so massive as to be almost incomprehensible.  Red Cross and East German government figures put the total deaths at every camp as 272.000, and 282,000 respectively which includes homosexuals, communists, gypsies, murderers, paedophiles etc. The 6 Million figure is a Kabbalist number, a magickal figure which featured in newspapers in the early 1900’s.  Where do the innocent Germans, Americans and others go to get a refund?  I call for criminal prosecution of individuals and groups who filed false lawsuits to obtain holocaust reparations and financial damage awards and perpetrating deliberate fraud upon Courts.  I call for the removal of Holocaust references in History books and educational materials.  I call for the removal of Holocaust Memorials worldwide.  It is long overdue that this intentional fraud be halted and those who perpetrated it be brought to justice for over 60 years of National Blood Libel against Germany and other nations through vicious lies and financial fraud.  Two of the most important surveys of the Jewish question in Europe during World War II are David Irving’s examination of the Russian archives after the wall came down. Irving published his findings in his book, “Hitler’s War” and said not one word about gas chambers.  When questioned about this omission he said that there was no reference to gas chambers in the archives and therefore he did not discuss the question of gas chambers. Irving was arrested in several countries for hate speech for his scholarly omission.  The International Red Cross published their analysis in a three volume “Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on its Activities during the Second World War” published in Geneva in 1948. This analysis expanded findings of two previous publications: “Sur L’activite’ du CICR en faveur des civils detencus dans les camps de concentration en Allemagne 1939-1945 Geneva, 1946 and “Inter Arma Caritas: The Work of the ICRF during the Second World War” Geneva, 1947.  In 1949 the International Red Cross interviewed prisoners in the German camps. They were not allowed to interview prisoners in the Russian camps which were far more harsh.  The German camps held both political prisoners Schutzhaflinge and those convicted of crimes. The Germans allowed the Red Cross to distribute food, medicine and clothing to the prisoners.  Grateful prisoners sent letters of thanks from Dachau, Buchenwalk, Sangerhausen, Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg, Flossenburg, Landsberg-am-Lech, Fibha, Ravensbruck, Hamburg-Neuengamme, Mauthausen, Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and others.  “The principal recipients were Belgians, Dutch, French, Greeks, Italians, Norwegians, Poles and stateless Jews” Vol. III, p. 83.  Regarding Theresienstadt, the Red Cross said, “where there were about 40,000 Jews deported from various countries, was a relatively privileged ghetto” Vol. III, p. 75.  “The Committee’s delegates were able to visit the camp at Theresienstadt Terezin which was used exclusively for Jews and was governed by special conditions … From information gathered by the Commitee, this camp had been started as an experiment by certain leaders of the Reich … These men wished to give the Jews the means of setting up a communal life in a town under their own administration and possessing almost complete autonomy … two delegates were able to visit the camp on April 6, 1945. They confirmed the favourable impression gained on the first visit” Vol. I, p. 642.  The ICRC also had praise for the regime of Ion Antonescu of Fascist Rumania where the Committee was able to extend special relief to 183,000 Rumanian Jews until the time of the Soviet occupation.  The aid then ceased and the ICRC complained bitterly that it never succeeded “in sending anything whatsoever to Russia” Vol. II, p. 62. The same situation applied to many of the German camps after their “liberation” by the Russians.  The ICRC received a voluminous flow of mail from Auschwitz until the period of the Soviet occupation, when many of the internees were evacuated westward. But the efforts of the Red Cross to send relief to internees remaining at Auschwitz under Soviet control were futile.  However, food parcels continued to be sent to former Auschwitz inmates transferred west to such camps as Buchenwald and Oranienburg.  NO MENTION OF GAS CHAMBERS  One of the most important aspects of the Report of the ICRC is that it clarifies the true cause of those deaths that undoubtedly occurred in the camps towards the end of the war.  Says the Report: “in the chaotic condition of Germany after the invasion during the final months of the war, the camps received no food supplies at all and starvation claimed an increasing number of victims.  Itself alarmed by this situation, the German Government at last informed the ICRC on February 1, 1945 … In March 1945, discussions between the President of the ICRC and General of the S.S. Kaltenbrunner gave even more decisive results.  Relief could henceforth be distributed by the ICRC and one delegate was authorised to stay in each camp .I.” Vol. III, p.83.  Clearly, the German authorities were at pains to relieve the dire situation as far as they were able.  The Red Cross are quite explicit in stating that food supplies ceased at this time due to the Allied bombing of German transportation, and in the interests of interned Jews they had protested on March 15, 1944 against “the barbarous aerial warfare of the Allies” Inter Armet Caritns, p. 78. B  By October 2, 1944, the ICRC had warned the German Foreign Office of the impending collapse of the German transportation system, declaring that starvation conditions for people throughout Germany were becoming inevitable.  In dealing with this comprehensive, three-volume Report, it is important to stress that the delegates of the International Red Cross found no evidence whatsoever of ‘gas chambers’.  The original 1946 edition did not even talk of ‘extermination’ or ‘death camps’ but after the emotional impact of the Nuremberg trials the Red Cross felt compelled to introduce into the expanded 1948 Report several, very cursory references to ‘death camps’ Vol. 1 p. 641 and ‘extermination camps’ Vol. I p. 645. However, no means of’extermination’ is indicated.  In all its 1,600 pages the three-volume Report does not even mention such a thing as a ‘gas chamber’. It acknowledges that Jews, like many other wartime nationalities, suffered rigours and privations, but’ its complete silence on the subject of ’gassings’ is ample refutation of the ‘Holocaust’ legend.  NOT ALL WERE INTERNED  Volume III of the Report of the ICRC, Chapter 3 I. Jewish Civilian Population deals with the “aid given to the Jewish section of the free population” and this chapter makes it quite plain that by no means all of the European Jews were placed in internment camps but remained, subject to certain restrictions, as part of the free civilian population.  This conflicts directly with the “thoroughness” of the supposed “extermination programme”, and with the claim in the forged Hoess memoirs that Eichmann was obsessed with seizing every single Jew he could lay his hands on,” In Slovakia, for example, where Eichmann’s assistant Dieter Wisliceny was in charge, the Report states that “A large proportian of the Jewish minority had permission to stay in the country, and at certain periods Slovakia was looked upon as a comparative haven of refuge for Jews, especially for those coming from Poland.  Those who remained in Slovakia seem to have been in comparative safety until the end of August 1944, when a rising against the German forces took place. While it is true that the law of May 15, 1942 had brought about the internment of several thousand Jews, these people were held in camps where the conditions of food and lodging were tolerable, and where the internees were allowed to do paid work on terms almost equal to those of the free labour market” Vol. I, p. 646.  Not only did large numbers of the three million or so European Jews avoid internment altogether, but the emigration of Jews continued throughout the war, generally by way of Hungary, Rumania and Turkey. Ironically, post-war Jewish emigration from German-occupied territories was also facilitated by the Reich, as in the case of the Polish Jews who had escaped to France before its occupation.  “The Jews from Poland who, whilst in France, had obtained entrance permits to the United States were held to be American citizens by the German occupying authorities, who further agreed to recognise the validity of about three thousand passports issued to Jews by the consulates of South American countries” Vol. 1, p. 645.  As future U.S. citizens, these Jews were held at the Vittel camp in southern France for American aliens. The emigration of European Jews from Hungary in particular proceeded during the war unhindered by the German authorities. “Until March 1944,” says the Red Cross Report, “Jews who had the privilege of visas for Palestine were free to leave Hungary” Vol. 1, p. 648. Even after the replacement of the Horthy Government in 1944 following its attempted armistice with the Soviet Union with a government more dependent on German authority, the emigration of Jews continued.  The Committee secured the pledges of both Britain and the United States “to give support by every means to the emigration of Jews from Hungary, ” and from the U.S. Government the ICRC received a message stating that “The Government of the United States… now specifically repeats its assurance that arrangements will be made by it for the care of all Jews who in the present circumstances are allowed to leave” Vol. 1, p. 649.  …………  Official International Red Cross Records Released  Sealed And Guarded Since The End Of WWII At Arolsen, Germany,  The Official IRC Records Reveal The Actual Concentration Camp Total Death  Toll Was 271,301  http://monamontgomery.com/products/271304.htm  ***  The Source of the six million figure is a Talmudic Jewish Talmud reference to a future holocaust in which six million Jews die.  The reason why they are claiming six million deaths in Nazi camps, even though that number vastly exceeds the number of Jews in Europe at the time, is because this reference in their scripture is something they fear deeply and wish to prevent at all costs.  The Ashkenazi Jews, which I have experience with honestly believe that prophecy is real, but can be manipulated.  They believe that prophets see into the future, and see what was believed and said, and then write that down as much as they reveal the word of GOD.  SO there is a group of Ashkenazi Jews who wish to make the six million figure HISTORY to prevent it from ever happening in the FUTURE by repeating this number over and over and over into the social concience, in the hope that prophets of old will also latch onto this, and report it as a factual event in the future, which would now be history.  In other words, they believe they can lie themselves a new future. I don’t think so – I think their hardest days are ahead and one thing is certain, the genie is out of the bottle and through the word, the real truth of Fukushima may be like silly putty slowly sinking into the carpet, eventually it will be TOTALLY sunk in the carpet and nothing will get it out.  THIS could cause the six million Jewish deaths the prophecy speaks of, and No, I do not believe they can lie their way out of it.

Often in trouble, they have lately shown that they share the trait most commonly associated with their mother…..a hopeless addiction to alcohol.  Both Melissa, 21, and Daphne, 19, were arrested this past weekend in San Francisco, California for breaking and entering. Officers were alerted to their crime by a silent alarm at “This Is The Way To Liquor,” a liquor store close to their home that had recently decided to temporarily close due to slow sales during the state’s lockdown.  The sisters had been incredibly upset by the decision to close, as the massive warehouse of spirits was their preferred place to shop for their partying needs. So this past Friday evening when they ran out of refreshments, the Pelosis decided that they would go there and just help themselves. Entering through the back door, the siblings walked in and proceeded to take from the shelves whatever they deserved, consuming as they went. It was a real ransacking.  The first officer on the scene was none other than Joe Barron, who gave a brief summary of the night’s events:  “The two girls were absolutely obliterated drunk. They thought that they had every right to be there for being loyal customers over the years and couldn’t understand why we had come to arrest them. They shouted out that they had to be there because they needed ‘vital quarantine supplies.’  When it did finally dawn on them that they were going to lock-up, they simply laughed and said that mommy would get them out right away and that I would lose my job for arresting ‘California royalty,’ as they called themselves. That was all I needed to hear. The handcuffs went on, and the daughters Pelosi spent the night in the drunk tank. I wish we could’ve kept the spoiled brats even longer.”  Mother Nancy did manage to get them sprung, but not until morning, as she was not alerted to their capture until after she had woken up from her own drunken stupor. And yes, charges previously filed by the DA were mysteriously dropped, despite all the flawless evidence in their possession with which to prosecute.

2695c66d,"Study Confirms Cannabinoids Occur Naturally In Human Breast Milk  In January 2017 a study confirmed that cannabinoids occur naturally in human breast milk-and it’s proving now to still be as relevant of a study as ever.  According to the findings of several major scientific studies, human breast milk naturally contains of the same cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, which are vital for proper human development.  Cell membranes in the body are naturally equipped with these cannabinoid receptors which, when activated support and maintain human health. Human breast milk is an abundant source of endocannabinoids, a specific type of neuromodulatory lipid that basically teaches a newborn child how to eat by stimulating the suckling process.  Dr. Melanie Dreher studied women using cannabis during their entire pregnancy and then studied the babies one year after birth. She found that babies of the women who had smoked cannabis daily during their pregnancy socialised more quickly, made eye contact more quickly and were easier to engage.  If it were not for these cannabinoids in breast milk, newborn children would not know how to eat, nor would they necessarily have the desire to eat, which could result in severe malnourishment and even death. Newborn children who are breastfed naturally receive doses of cannabinoids that trigger hunger and promote growth and development.  Observations of how babies acts after being fed show they exhibit symptoms of cannabinoid use. As well as the essential function of stimulating an infants appetite, cannabinoids also help to calm and relax the baby. Cannabinoids are not, however, present in baby formula, which makes it far more inferior to breast milk.  Furthermore, a study on the endocannabinoid receptor system that was published in the European Journal of Pharmacology reported: “The medical implications of these novel developments are far reaching and suggest a promising future for cannabinoids in paediatric medicine for conditions including ‘non-organic failure-to-thrive’ and cystic fibrosis.”  There are two types of cannabinoid receptors in the body; the CB1 variety which exists in the brain, and the CB2 variety which exists in the immune system and throughout the rest of the body. Each one of these receptors responds to cannabinoids, whether it be from human breast milk in children, or from cannabis.  This essentially means that the human body requires and produces endocannabinoids, as these nutritive substances play a critical role in supporting and maintaining human health.

This is why President Trump decided to sue them for all they’re worth, for exposing him and saying horrible things.  Luckily for the American people, the Supreme Court decided in favor of the President, awarding him 500 million dollars, the largest fictitious libel lawsuit in American history. This lawsuit had no chance of losing, as it was written up by famed Constitutional attorney, Chad Benoit, who has never lost a case in his 15-year career.  Justice Joe Barron, who made the decision, gave the following statement when issuing the verdict:  “Libel laws are essential to Democracy. They keep the press honest, and they keep the truth from being washed away. That is why I rule in favor of Donald Trump. CNN has said so many nasty things about him. Despite being truthful, it is wrong to say bad things about the President, as that is un-American. FOX News never said nasty lies about Obama, so why should CNN be able to? All networks must be held to the same standard, and that is what this ruling intends to do.”  President Trump has been hard at work today, tweeting about his latest victory in court.

5491b156,"Editor note and update: Since our original article was published, the Michigan secretary of state’s office has published a notice explaining that the Antrim county reporting mistake resulted from a user error, not a software error, and did not affect the election results or other counties or states. — ANTRIM COUNTY, MI -This is an update to an earlier report we filed about a computer “glitch” in Antrim County, Michigan which was reported to have only affected two Republican votes in the important swing state. However, the Detroit Free Press is reporting it was much, much worse. According to Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican who ran unopposed and won a third term on Tuesday in a very strong Republican county, results on electronic tapes and a computer card were apparently accurate, however when the results were transcribed from the cards to a computer, something appeared to be wrong. In 2016, President Trump won the county with around 62% of the vote, compared to 33% for Hillary Clinton. The president outpolled Clinton by 4,000 votes. Wednesday morning after the election, results in the county showed Biden leading the president by around 3,000 votes with 98% of precincts reporting. Nothing to see here, right? Guy said that officials hadn’t checked the results prior to posting them, however later asked: “How could Democrats take over this county?” Clearly, that made zero sense. She said that officials were going over the tape of the results and inputting the numbers manually. Antrim uses Dominion voting equipment and doesn’t use cellular modems to transmit results from precincts to county offices. Rather, the data is transported by election officials, Guy said. She originally noted she was in talks with the company that maintains the equipment but said it could be the result of “human error.” Tom McMillin, a former state lawmaker from Oakland County told the Detroit Free Press that he is estimating that both President Trump and US Senate Candidate John James could realize between 4,000-5,000 votes each. Joe Gumm, a local news anchor with KXXV-TV tweeted about Michigan’s use of the same Election Source program and noted that 33 other counties used that same possibly compromised program to compile their vote totals. A political commentator, Dennis Lennox also questioned the vote totals from other counties in the state. “Trump did not lose #AntrimCounty in #Michigan. It is now confirmed that 32 other counties use the same software as Antrim County. He will get 6,000 plus votes out of Antrim. What about the other counties with the same software?” he tweeted. But according to AFP: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office released a statement on November 7 explaining what went wrong in Antrim, and how it was corrected. “The error in reporting unofficial results in Antrim County Michigan was the result of a user error that was quickly identified and corrected; did not affect the way ballots were actually tabulated; and would have been identified in the county canvass before official results were reported even if it had not been identified earlier,” the statement said. The software program, Election Source, worked properly and correctly counted votes, but the county missed an operation step, the statement said. This resulted in a miscommunication between the software and the county’s central election management system that was quickly corrected. “This was an isolated error, there is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state, and if it did it would be caught during county canvasses, which are conducted by bipartisan boards of county canvassers.” Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy is quoted on the county’s Facebook page: “We continue to work hard to ensure the integrity of the election results.” It will be interesting to see if the 138,339 vote dump that went to Biden under the cover of darkness early Wednesday morning , with The Federalist noting that “Biden somehow got all of the votes, and Trump got none, zero, in an overnight vote-dump.” An apparent “issue” with an election ballot counting program caused only two votes to be tallied for Republican candidates. The problem is being blamed on programming “infrastructure” and could be prevalent through other counties across the state of Michigan. Two major races are impacted by this “issue”: President, with Joe Biden now leading Donald Trump in the state; and United States Senate, with John James losing to Democratic incumbent Gary Peters. The problem was discovered Wednesday morning. Republican state legislator Triston Cole heard of the two votes cast for Representative Jack Bergman in his county that were counted, and responded: “I can guarantee that there were 6 [Bergman votes] in my immediate family alone.” Election results are no longer posted on the county’s website, and county authorities released an official statement: “Early this morning, the Antrim County Clerk, Sheryl Guy, became aware of apparently skewed results in the Unofficial Election Result tabulations. Since then, the Clerk’s Office has been reviewing the results and the multiple redundancies to search out any possible discrepancies. Staff is currently working with township officials and with Election Source, the company that provides the voting software programs and hardware.” Sheryl Guy reported that vote totals on printed tabulator tapes and totals counted by the election software did not match. The printed tabulated tapes from each precinct will now be counted manually as a result. There have been more than 16,000 votes cast in Antrim County. Michigan Republican party chairperson Laura Cox stated: “The irregularities reported this morning are incredibly troubling, especially given how close the election results are in Michigan.” On Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed suit against the state of Michigan, claiming poll observers had been denied access to polling sites.

Reports and rumors of tons of ballots mysteriously appearing in the middle of the night have cast doubt on these turnout claims. Officially, Michigan is claiming that more than 5,260,000 citizens have voted. Challengers to election results for and against both parties have arrived at polling locations in the state. The TCF Convention Center is Detroit is ground zero for these groups, with about 50 challengers representing the Republicans. Other groups include the ACLU, NAACP, and union group representatives. Branden Snyder, executive director of Detroit Action, a housing and economic justice group stated: “We got a call that they needed more volunteers. Our goal is to make sure the process is fair and equal.” It is unknown on what authority Mr. Snyder used in his action afterwards, but when more than 100 opposing challengers arrived at the TCF Center, he turned them away for the day. In other election irregularities, the United States Postal Service USPS failed to comply with a federal court order, effectively ignoring the order. The USPS indicated that it couldn’t meet the 3 p.m. deadline set by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan for facilities to sweep their buildings for mail-in ballots.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy filed a response to Judge Sullivan’s order, indicating the service didn’t have enough inspectors to cover the task. USPS processed 150,000 ballots after Election Day, jeopardizing thousands of votes https://t.co/RDW0V0Nwpo — Bo Snerdley @BoSnerdley November 6, 2020 There will certainly be a discussion and possible sanctions over the “apparent lack of compliance with the Court’s order,” according to an after-action order filed by Sullivan.

2d416d3f,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC is essentially setting policy across the country, endlessly putting out a stream of so-called facts that they then revise or rescind.  Their latest update on COVID-19, posted on Tuesday, is headlined: What do your results mean?  “A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses called coronaviruses, such as the one that causes the common cold.”  This is the case for the “past infection” test, not the current COVID-19 test to see if you have the virus right now. Current case counts do not include the antibody test and the antibodies are not detectable until well into or after the illness.  TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO  Coronaviruses CoV — called that because they have spikes around a central ball that looks like the sun — are part of a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from a cold to more severe diseases, including COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, and others such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS-CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV.  SARS -CoV-2 is also known as a novel coronavirus nCoV because it is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.  Many of the symptoms from coronaviruses are similar: upper respiratory infection, fever, coughing, sneezing. While MERS and SARS can be serious — and SARS-CoV-2 as well, at least for the elderly and others with co-morbidities — most are treatable and nearly all people afflicted recover.  So why does the CDC frame it this way?  J.B. Neiman, a managing partner and general counsel of a Texas-based health care company that owns 13 free-standing clinics, has an idea. He told former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, who has been on the forefront of covering the facts behind COVID-19, that the bottom line is money.  Neiman told Berenson he has “heard several stories of how discharge planners are being pressured to put Covid as primary diagnosis — as that pays significantly better. Hospitals want to avoid the discussion but if they don’t they risk another shutdown. This may be an explanation for why there is a gap in hospital executives saying they have plenty of capacity and the increasing number of Covid hospitalizations. You open up your hospitals for normal medical care and you test everyone of those patients — the result is higher percentage of patients who have Covid — now.”  The mainstream media is breathlessly reporting a spike in new infections even though we’re all wearing masks, so how’d that happen?.  But virtually no one is reporting that deaths from the virus are way down.  On June 27, there were 623 deaths attributed to COVID-19, according to OurWorldInData.com. Two days later, the death toll in the U.S. was 265.  By comparison, 4,928 people died in the U.S. on the peak day, April 16. Deaths have been declining steadily, at least until June 26, when the toll reached 2,437 the website notes that “some states added probable deaths” on that date. The deaths rose again to 1,270 on Tuesday, but at least one COVID watchdog said there was again a reason for that rise.  “That ‘spike’ yesterday includes more than 600 backdated NYC cases, most from three weeks or more ago.

6a72f5c5,"James Humphrey Terwilliger Woods, conservative icon, award-winning actor, and patriotic Trump supporter was found dead in his home last night at 74.  According to police reports, they haven’t ruled out foul play, though they can’t imagine who would want Mr. Woods dead. Lead detective Art Tubolls told us that this was one of the saddest cases he’s ever worked:  “To find such a great man slumped over like that was devastating. All I could think about was his portrayal of Roy Cohn, whom he shared so much in common with in real life. “Mr. Woods is a national treasure, dead or alive.”  The coroner hasn’t released an official cause of death:  “We’re not quite sure what happened yet, and we don’t like to speculate. “There is, however, growing evidence that Woods may have died of embarrasment after sharing an article from a liberal troll’s satire network that was both ridiculous and clearly disclaimered. And it wasn’t the first time. It’s sad, but many of that generation seem to have the same issues. Woods is just…a tater. Like the rest of the Trump supporters over 65.”  The FBI has vowed to get involved if they can confirm that Woods was the victim of a hate crime, as long as his buddy Curt Schilling, who was also dumb enough to comment on the fake article, ends up dead, too.  Schilling’s agent says he’s not sure if Curt would go for it, since he’d have to die to collect, but that he’d be happy to do three somersaults for $50.

e592fd47,"I attended a dinner party this past weekend and was intrigued by the tone of the conversations that swirled around the room. There were, of course, the typical fluff conversations that were intended to lightly touch the surface of various subjects – but then there were conversations circling around Ebola and an underlying distrust of the government.  This was actually surprising to me, since I was in the heart of Los Angeles and these people were definitely not clinging to their guns and religion. The majority of them were upper middle class – baby boomers and yuppies who would never want to be thought of as conservative, but as more libertarian in their political views.  I sat with two men and a woman who were debating the question of whether or not Ebola was something to really be concerned about, and their comments took me aback. The men were bringing up the fact that in the past few years, everything that has come out of Washington has been misleading or an out and out lie – from Obamacare, if you like your doctor, to the Department of Veterans Affairs allowing vets to die waiting for an appointment. They said that they were viewing the reassurances about Ebola coming from the CDC with a skeptical eye. Their biggest question was: Why is there no urgency to stop the disease from entering the U.S.?  At that point I jumped in with some facts I had just discovered about the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, who has been the out front spokesman on the Ebola crisis. I found an article published by the Washington Post on July 16 of this year reporting that Frieden had been called to testify on Capitol Hill about researchers at his agency that had mishandled live anthrax and other deadly pathogens in a number of mishaps over the past year or so. This came on the heels of federal officials finding forgotten smallpox samples in a storage room at the National Institute for Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. They also discovered 12 boxes and 327 vials with pathogens that included the virus behind dengue and spotted fever. When Frieden testified about the anthrax, his response was: We missed a critical pattern, and the pattern is an insufficient culture of safety. Really? And this is the guy in charge of making decisions on Ebola?

TRENDING: Voters blame Biden for border crisis, ready to punish Democrats, poll says  Upon hearing this latest evidence of the incompetence permeating our government, the conversation veered into conspiracy territory. One of the men brought up the fact that Washington has known for months if not years that we were at risk for some sort of global pandemic. According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that's just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened.  Questions were then brought up about the stockpiling of ammunition and weapons by Homeland Security over the past couple of years and the $1 billion worth of disposable FEMA coffins supposedly stored in Georgia. Why was there preparation being made for FEMA camps to house people in isolation? These were the questions being seriously discussed.  Recent polls show that there is a crisis of confidence among the people. When the people lose all trust in their government because of the lies they have been told over and over again, theories begin to emerge about all sorts of things. We desperately need someone to rebuild the trust and restore faith in this government. The damage that has been done is almost irreparable.  My fear is that this has all been orchestrated from the very beginning. Who knows?

The FBI, in conjunction with the US Capitol Marshals Service, delivered the warrant to Pelosi’s office to search for “anything and everything pertinent to the investigation into the Deep State shadow government.”  Pelosi, who was already drunk by 9 AM, threw a little temper tantrum and had to be detained “for her own protection as well as those around her.” The warrant was executed and Pelosi was released without incident.  According to the Marshals’ office, they logged 14 boxes of material evidence deemed to be conducive to the ongoing investigation.

Despite its tremendous impact, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has remained mysterious and controversial. The natural origin theory, although widely accepted, lacks substantial support. The alternative theory that the virus may have come from a research laboratory is, however, strictly censored on peer-reviewed scientific journals. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 shows biological characteristics that are inconsistent with a naturally occurring, zoonotic virus. In this report, we describe the genomic, structural, medical, and literature evidence, which, when considered together, strongly contradicts the natural origin theory. The evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 should be a laboratory product created by using bat coronaviruses ZC45 and/or ZXC21 as a template and/or backbone. Building upon the evidence, we further postulate a synthetic route for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the laboratory-creation of this coronavirus is convenient and can be accomplished in approximately six months. Our work emphasizes the need for an independent investigation into the relevant research laboratories. It also argues for a critical look into certain recently published data, which, albeit problematic, was used to support and claim a natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. From a public health perspective, these actions are necessary as knowledge of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and of how the virus entered the human population are of pivotal importance in the fundamental control of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as in preventing similar, future pandemics.",Unusual Features of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Suggesting Sophisticated Laboratory Modification Rather Than Natural Evolution and Delineation of Its Probable Synthetic Route,FALSE

The initial bill passed through the House of Representatives in November. Local New Hartford congresswoman Claudia Tenney worked first hand with the bill for the past several months.  She said the initial blueprint to the bill was unacceptable and needed to be refined.  “We were able to get a ten thousand dollar deduction for property tax, which in our area would cover houses which cost up to three hundred and fifty thousand dollars” said Tenney.  She said this deduction is for those state employees such as firefighters and police officers who are retired and live off a pension. Tenney said this is what led her to vote “yes” on the bill.  Tenney also said, for middle class Americans this potential tax cut could be tremendous. Tenney mentioned, the Child Care Tax Credit which has been increased to $1,600 per child, however she said she hopes this section of the bill will be increased even further to $2,500.  “It isn’t where I would like to see it,” said Tenney. “There were some things I liked in the House bill that weren’t in the senate bill and some things I liked in the Senate bill that weren’t in the House bill.”  The next plan in the process is for both the senate and the house to meet tomorrow to start the compromising process.  “It’s going to be a very contentious next few weeks to get this passed before Christmas, but I do believe were on track to get it done,” said Tenney.",Tenney Speaks on Tax Bill,partially false
bda56511,"By Peter Andrews , Irish science journalist and writer based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics  It has been revealed that the standard tests being used in the US to diagnose Covid-19 cases are far too sensitive, with the vast majority of people marked down as being positive actually turning out to be negative.  Top US virologists have been stunned by revelations about the laxity of the US Covid testing regimen. It turns out that tests that deliver a simple binary “positive or negative” result are not fit for purpose, as they tell us nothing about the contagiousness of each person.  Data from three US states – New York, Nevada and Massachusetts – shows that when the amount of the virus found in a person is taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who have tested positive should actually have been negative, as they are carrying only tiny amounts of the virus, are not contagious, pose no risk to others, and have no need to isolate.  This means that only a fraction of the daily “cases” being reported so hysterically in the mainstream media are actual, bona fide Covid-19 sufferers, and need treatment and to separate themselves from others.  Also on rt.com White House rejects ‘corrupt’ WHO concerns over Covid-19 vaccine development  It’s a sensitive issue  So how could this have happened? The answer has to do with the sensitivity of PCR Polymerase chain reaction tests for Covid, which it turns out can be ramped up according to the taste of the testing companies. Most testing companies have chosen the outrageously high sensitivity limit of 40 PCR cycles – meaning that the DNA in a sample is exponentially increased 40 times in order to amplify its signal.  Read more  But using such a ridiculously sensitive test means that the faintest traces of a dead virus, or even leftovers from previous infections, can result in a positive. Professor Juliet Morrison, a University of California virologist, said that even a limit of 35 PCR cycles is too high, let alone 40. She said she was “shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive.” But apparently, pretty much everyone in the US Covid brain trust took exactly that on faith.  So the scale of the pandemic ‘problem’ is actually much smaller than we’ve been led to believe – about a tenth of what all the politicians and media have been using to justify the lockdowns, the quarantines, the mass testing. Some may be shocked that the scale of the problem is so much smaller than assumed. But for a seasoned ignorer of any and all statistics that contain Covid ‘cases’, there are no surprises here. The truth is, there was never any reason to be confident in such figures. The FDA has only now been forced to concede that they have no idea how different testing companies determine which the positive and negative tests are: they just accept whatever data they are given.  What these findings bring is absolute assurance that the testing to this point has been an utter waste of time, and that not one statistic concerning this pandemic – from cases to deaths to infection rates – can be believed. But it should not have taken some journalist to ask the right question to discover this: a bit of common sense would have been enough. What is it going to take for these professional virologists to drop their assumptions and models, and just start acting based on the facts at hand?  Also on rt.com We might have to wait forever for science to show the Covid threat is over, so let’s use our common sense & get back to normal  Scrap test and trace  It’s a virus so deadly, you need a test to tell whether you have it or not. So goes the refrain of many lockdown skeptics, Covidiots and anti-maskers, of whom I am an indignant supporter. Something has gone… not just wrong, but totally haywire... when the might of the world’s scientific establishment is trained with the zeal of a Witchfinder General on one particular microscopic particle. Not even a particularly dangerous particle; the latest data show it is the eighth most common cause of death in England, and it doesn’t make the top ten in Wales.  Meanwhile, in Wuhan, the original source of this disease, the pool parties are in full swing. They don’t seem to be too worried about PCR tests or contact tracing, or even the virus itself. The Chinese government says that their supreme lockdown was so awesome that they now have zero Covid: a biological impossibility. Maybe they just stopped testing, and decided to get on with their lives. Everyone else should take a leaf out of their book.  Think your friends would be interested?

A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night.  Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.  Her statement made the general explode, our source said.  “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said.  Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress.  “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.  Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”  Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”  Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.  “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that.

f3d06c7d,"The biggest ever rise in public dissatisfaction with the NHS was recorded last year, according to a long-running survey.  The British Social Attitudes Survey has been tracking satisfaction since 1983.  The 2015 poll of nearly 2,200 people showed satisfaction with the NHS at 60% - down from a peak of 70% in 2010.  Some 23% said they were actively dissatisfied - a rise of eight percentage points on the year before and the biggest single jump in a year. Graph on NHS satisfaction  Waiting times were cited as the biggest reason for dissatisfaction - mentioned by over half of people - followed by there being not enough staff.  The findings come amid growing pressure on waiting times for cancer care, A&E and routine operations, such as knee and hip operations.  Patients reported highest satisfaction rates for GP services and lowest for social care, which is run by local authorities and covers home help for tasks such as washing and dressing, and care homes.  The survey - carried out by NatCen Social Research - covered Scotland, Wales and England. The differences between the three nations were not considered to be statistically significant. Graph on NHS satisfaction Graph on NHS satisfaction  Chris Ham, chief executive of the King's Fund think-tank, said that while overall satisfaction levels were still high by historical standards, the findings should act as a real wake up call.  What's gone wrong is the public's perception of the NHS under growing pressure. Money is tight, waiting times are getting longer, people are concerned that when they need the NHS it might not be there for them.  Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, agreed the public needed reassurance about the future of the NHS.  But he said the most important set of results were on social care. He said the satisfaction levels were deeply concerning and said the system needed greater funding.  A spokesman for the Department of Health in England said: There is pressure on the NHS as our population ages, and that's why the government is investing record amounts to transform care.

907e767b,"If you stack up the orange bars until 1/22, you get 444 cases. Now add up all the grey bars. They add up to ~12,000 cases. So when Wuhan thought it had 444 cases, it had 27 times more. If France thinks it has 1,400 cases, it might well have tens of thousands  The same math applies to Paris. With ~30 cases inside the city, the true number of cases is likely to be in the hundreds, maybe thousands. With 300 cases in the Ile-de-France region, the total cases in the region might already exceed tens of thousands.  Spain and Madrid  Spain has very similar numbers as France 1,200 cases vs. 1,400, and both have 30 deaths. That means the same rules are valid: Spain has probably upwards of 20k true cases already.  In the Comunidad de Madrid region, with 600 official cases and 17 deaths, the true number of cases is likely between 10,000 and 60,000.  If you read these data and tell yourself: “Impossible, this can’t be true”, just think this: With this number of cases, Wuhan was already in lockdown.  With the number of cases we see today in countries like the US, Spain, France, Iran, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden or Switzerland, Wuhan was already in lockdown.  And if you’re telling yourself: “Well, Hubei is just one region”, let me remind you that it has nearly 60 million people, bigger than Spain and about the size of France.  2. What Will Happen When These Coronavirus Cases Materialize?  So the coronavirus is already here. It’s hidden, and it’s growing exponentially.  What will happen in our countries when it hits? It’s easy to know, because we already have several places where it’s happening. The best examples are Hubei and Italy.  Fatality Rates  The World Health Organization WHO quotes 3.4% as the fatality rate % people who contract the coronavirus and then die. This number is out of context so let me explain it.  It really depends on the country and the moment: between 0.6% in South Korea and 4.4% in Iran. So what is it? We can use a trick to figure it out.  The two ways you can calculate the fatality rate is Deaths/Total Cases and Death/Closed Cases. The first one is likely to be an underestimate, because lots of open cases can still end up in death. The second is an overestimate, because it’s likely that deaths are closed quicker than recoveries.  What I did was look at how both evolve over time. Both of these numbers will converge to the same result once all cases are closed, so if you project past trends to the future, you can make a guess on what the final fatality rate will be.  This is what you see in the data. China’s fatality rate is now between 3.6% and 6.1%. If you project that in the future, it looks like it converges towards ~3.8%-4%. This is double the current estimate, and 30 times worse than the flu.  It is made up of two completely different realities though: Hubei and the rest of China.  Hubei’s fatality rate will probably converge towards 4.8%. Meanwhile, for the rest of China, it will likely converge to ~0.9%:  I also charted the numbers for Iran, Italy and South Korea, the only countries with enough deaths to make this somewhat relevant.  Iran’s and Italy’s Deaths / Total Cases are both converging towards the 3%-4% range. My guess is their numbers will end up around that figure too.  South Korea is the most interesting example, because these 2 numbers are completely disconnected: deaths / total cases is only 0.6%, but deaths / closed cases is a whopping 48%. My take on it is that a few unique things are happening there. First, they’re testing everybody with so many open cases, the death rate seems low, and leaving the cases open for longer so they close cases quickly when the patient is dead. Second, they have a lot of hospital beds see chart 17.b. There might also be other reasons we don’t know. What is relevant is that deaths/cases has hovered around 0.5% since the beginning, suggesting it will stay there, likely heavily influenced by the healthcare system and crisis management.  The last relevant example is the Diamond Princess cruise: with 706 cases, 6 deaths and 100 recoveries, the fatality rate will be between 1% and 6.5%.  Note that the age distribution in each country will also have an impact: Since mortality is much higher for older people, countries with an aging population like Japan will be harder hit on average than younger countries like Nigeria. There are also weather factors, especially humidity and temperature, but it’s still unclear how this will impact transmission and fatality rates.  This is what you can conclude:  Excluding these, countries that are prepared will see a fatality rate of ~0.5% South Korea to 0.9% rest of China.  Countries that are overwhelmed will have a fatality rate between ~3%-5%  Put in another way: Countries that act fast can reduce the number of deaths by a factor of ten. And that’s just counting the fatality rate. Acting fast also drastically reduces the cases, making this even more of a no-brainer.  Countries that act fast reduce the number of deaths at least by 10x.  So what does a country need to be prepared?  What Will Be the Pressure on the System  Around 20% of cases require hospitalization, 5% of cases require the Intensive Care Unit ICU, and around 2.5% require very intensive help, with items such as ventilators or ECMO extra-corporeal oxygenation.  The problem is that items such as ventilators and ECMO can’t be produced or bought easily. A few years ago, the US had a total of 250 ECMO machines, for example.  So if you suddenly have 100,000 people infected, many of them will want to go get tested. Around 20,000 will require hospitalization, 5,000 will need the ICU, and 1,000 will need machines that we don’t have enough of today. And that’s just with 100,000 cases.  That is without taking into account issues such as masks. A country like the US has only 1% of the masks it needs to cover the needs of its healthcare workers 12M N95, 30M surgical vs. 3.5B needed. If a lot of cases appear at once, there will be masks for only 2 weeks.  Countries like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong or Singapore, as well as Chinese regions outside of Hubei, have been prepared and given the care that patients need.  But the rest of Western countries are rather going in the direction of Hubei and Italy. So what is happening there?  What an Overwhelmed Healthcare System Looks Like  The stories that happened in Hubei and those in Italy are starting to become eerily similar. Hubei built two hospitals in ten days, but even then, it was completely overwhelmed.  Both complained that patients inundated their hospitals. They had to be taken care of anywhere: in hallways, in waiting rooms…  I heavily recommend this short Twitter thread. It paints a pretty stark picture of Italy today  Healthcare workers spend hours in a single piece of protective gear, because there’s not enough of them. As a result, they can’t leave the infected areas for hours. When they do, they crumble, dehydrated and exhausted. Shifts don’t exist anymore. People are driven back from retirement to cover needs. People who have no idea about nursing are trained overnight to fulfill critical roles. Everybody is on call, always.  Francesca Mangiatordi, an Italian nurse that crumbled in the middle of the war with the Coronavirus  That is, until they become sick. Which happens a lot, because they’re in constant exposure to the virus, without enough protective gear. When that happens, they need to be in quarantine for 14 days, during which they can’t help. Best case scenario, 2 weeks are lost. Worst case, they’re dead.  The worst is in the ICUs, when patients need to share ventilators or ECMOs. These are in fact impossible to share, so the healthcare workers must determine what patient will use it. That really means, which one lives and which one dies.  “After a few days, we have to choose. […] Not everyone can be intubated. We decide based on age and state of health.” —Christian Salaroli, Italian MD.  Medical workers wear protective suits to attend to people sickened by the novel coronavirus, in the intensive care unit of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 6. China Daily/Reuters, via Washington Post  All of this is what drives a system to have a fatality rate of ~4% instead of ~0.5%. If you want your city or your country to be part of the 4%, don’t do anything today.  Satellite images show Behesht Masoumeh cemetery in the Iranian city of Qom. Photograph: ©2020 Maxar Technologies. Via The Guardian and the The New York Times.  3. What Should You Do?  Flatten the Curve  This is a pandemic now. It can’t be eliminated. But what we can do is reduce its impact.  Some countries have been exemplary at this. The best one is Taiwan, which is extremely connected with China and yet still has as of today fewer than 50 cases. This recent paper explain all the measures they took early on, which were focused on containment.  They have been able to contain it, but most countries lacked this expertise and didn’t. Now, they’re playing a different game: mitigation. They need to make this virus as inoffensive as possible.  If we reduce the infections as much as possible, our healthcare system will be able to handle cases much better, driving the fatality rate down. And, if we spread this over time, we will reach a point where the rest of society can be vaccinated, eliminating the risk altogether. So our goal is not to eliminate coronavirus contagions. It’s to postpone them.  The more we postpone cases, the better the healthcare system can function, the lower the mortality rate, and the higher the share of the population that will be vaccinated before it gets infected.  How do we flatten the curve?  Social Distancing  There is one very simple thing that we can do and that works: social distancing.  If you go back to the Wuhan graph, you will remember that as soon as there was a lockdown, cases went down. That’s because people didn’t interact with each other, and the virus didn’t spread.  The current scientific consensus is that this virus can be spread within 2 meters 6 feet if somebody coughs. Otherwise, the droplets fall to the ground and don’t infect you.  The worst infection then becomes through surfaces: The virus survives for up to 9 days on different surfaces such as metal, ceramics and plastics. That means things like doorknobs, tables, or elevator buttons can be terrible infection vectors.  The only way to truly reduce that is with social distancing: Keeping people home as much as possible, for as long as possible until this recedes.  This has already been proven in the past. Namely, in the 1918 flu pandemic.  Learnings from the 1918 Flu Pandemic  You can see how Philadelphia didn’t act quickly, and had a massive peak in death rates. Compare that with St Louis, which did.  Then look at Denver, which enacted measures and then loosened them. They had a double peak, with the 2nd one higher than the first.  If you generalize, this is what you find:  This chart shows, for the 1918 flu in the US, how many more deaths there were per city depending on how fast measures were taken. For example, a city like St Louis took measures 6 days before Pittsburgh, and had less than half the deaths per citizen. On average, taking measures 20 days earlier halved the death rate.  Italy has finally figured this out. They first locked down Lombardy on Sunday, and one day later, on Monday, they realized their mistake and decided they had to lock down the entire country.  Hopefully, we will see results in the coming days. However, it will take one to two weeks to see. Remember the Wuhan graph: there was a delay of 12 days between the moment when the lockdown was announced and the moment when official cases orange started going down.  How Can Politicians Contribute to Social Distancing?  The question politicians are asking themselves today is not whether they should do something, but rather what’s the appropriate action to take.  There are several stages to control an epidemic, starting with anticipation and ending with eradication. But it’s too late for most options today. With this level of cases, the only options politicians have in front of them are containment, mitigation or suppression.  Containment  Containment is making sure all the cases are identified, controlled, and isolated. It’s what Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan are doing so well: They very quickly limit people coming in, identify the sick, immediately isolate them, use heavy protective gear to protect their health workers, track all their contacts, quarantine them… This works extremely well when you’re prepared and you do it early on, and don’t need to grind your economy to a halt to make it happen.  I’ve already touted Taiwan’s approach. But China’s is good too. The lengths at which it went to contain the virus are mind-boggling. For example, they had up to 1,800 teams of 5 people each tracking every infected person, everybody they got interacted with, then everybody those people interacted with, and isolating the bunch. That’s how they were able to contain the virus across a billion-people country.  This is not what Western countries have done. And now it’s too late. The recent US announcement that most travel from Europe was banned is a containment measure for a country that has, as of today, 3 times the cases that Hubei had when it shut down, growing exponentially. How can we know if it’s enough? It turns out, we can know by looking at the Wuhan travel ban.",Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now,TRUE
402cad4f,"By Cassandra Fairbanks and Jim Hoft  On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes. This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat present during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.

c5bc6ccd,"The grandparents of a three-year-old girl have been blocked from adopting her because they are ‘too old’, it emerged last night.  They had been left in charge of the child after her mother – who has a history of mental health problems – was sectioned.  But the youngster, their only grandchild, was taken away from them and handed to foster parents.  Cuddles: The three-year-old girl, left, with her grandmother, right, faces have been pixelated for legal reasons  The adoption will go ahead on July 31 unless they win the right to appeal.  The grandmother, 58, and grandfather, 70, have even been told by social workers to mark the occasion with a ‘party’ and bring a cake – a suggestion they described as ‘insulting’.  If the appeal fails the only contact they will have with their granddaughter is two letters they are allowed to send each year until she is 18.  Their daughter will be allowed to see photos of her once a year but cannot keep copies.  Last night the ‘emotionally traumatised’ grandmother, a shop assistant, said: ‘I don’t feel old at all. I work two days a week. It’s just awful they could take her away from us.  ‘It is devastating and so silly. Women have children older and older these days anyway.’  Close: The little girl with her grandfather in a pirate hat. The retired firefighter says the family has been 'kicked in the teeth'  The grandfather, a retired firefighter, described his family’s treatment as ‘wicked’ and said he was amazed it could happen ‘in a civilised society’.  ‘We would be 100 per cent capable of caring for her and we would be over the moon to have her,' he said.  We have been kicked in the teeth by social workers. It is shocking they have that much power to take a family apart Grandfather, 70, retired firefighter  ‘But we have been kicked in the teeth by social workers. It is shocking they have that much power to take a family apart.’  Many women older than 58 have become mothers around the world and Britain’s oldest mother, Sue Tollefsen, gave birth to her only child, Freya, in 2008 when she was 57.  The girl at the centre of the adoption wrangle, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was born to the couple’s daughter, who is now in her 30s and is no longer in a relationship with the girl’s father. The child’s mother was sectioned in January after self-harming.  One week later, a social worker appeared at the grandparents’ home in Shoeburyness, Essex, demanding they hand the child over.  They did not see her again until March and even then were allowed to see her only once a week.  The grandfather said: ‘A social worker came round saying she’d come to pick up her clothes because they were taking her into foster care.  Southend-on-Sea Borough Council pictured above has put the child up for adoption and a lawyer who has taken on the case expressed concern that workers were 'pursuing adoption targets that generate income'  'We didn’t know what was going on but they’d applied for a court order with a view to adoption.’  The social worker showed them a form which they have since learned the mother had been persuaded to sign from her specialist mental health hospital bed – with no legal representative present – consenting to her daughter being taken into care.  THE BIAS OF SOCIAL WORKERS: GRANDPARENTS' BATTLE TO BRING UP CHILDREN AND THE OBSTACLES THEY FACE Grandparents are legally allowed to bring up children in place of the parents – but can face obstacles when social workers become involved. The Children Act of 1989 says that ‘private fostering’ – which is an informal arrangement with the parents – does not need to be reported to social workers or considered by a court if the carers are close relatives, including grandparents. Grandparents can choose to go to court to get an adoption order so that they are legally responsible for their grandchild without needing the approval of a state-recognised adoption agency. They can also take out a Special Guardianship order, which means the child remains formally under control of his or her natural parents, but is legally in the everyday charge of the guardian. But if social workers are involved in the case, they can rule that the grandparents are ‘unfit’ to bring up the child – and it seems they are often quick to do so. Last year a family court judge publicly condemned social workers who he said were ‘visibly biased’ against the grandparents of a two-year-old boy. Advertisement  At Chelmsford family court on June 17, a judge ruled adoption should go ahead but the grandparents could not be candidates.  They attended court but were unable to argue their case as they could not afford legal representation.  Grandparents are not entitled to legal aid in care cases. The assessment claiming they are not suitable to care for the toddler is not available to the public.  But the Daily Mail understands it claimed the couple would be incapable of acting as her guardians when she reached adolescence.  It initially gave their ages incorrectly. The error was corrected but the judge said they were too old as the grandfather would be 82 and the grandmother 70 when the girl turned 15.  The couple said they were also accused of not caring for their own daughter properly, a claim never previously made.  A lawyer who has now taken up their case pro bono yesterday expressed concern that social workers at Southend Council were pursuing adoption targets that generate income.  Karina Chetwynd, of John Copland and Son solicitors, said: ‘In my view, adoption is a cash cow. There is a lot of money paid for each adoption and each local authority has targets.’  Miss Chetwynd is hoping to be granted the right to appeal by arguing that the grandparents’ human rights were breached and they are entitled to a fair hearing and to a family life.  Anne Jones, the Southend councillor responsible for child welfare, said: ‘Age is not the deciding factor in our assessments. We have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of the children.",Grandparents blocked from adopting granddaughter hit out at 'wicked' treatment,FALSE

2a83bbb5,"Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly “enjoyed to boast” about “carrying out a sex act on George Clooney,” according to Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre.  The U.K. Sun reported that this claim was made by Giuffre in a manuscript of a book called “The Billionaire’s Playboy Club.” Giuffre wrote that Maxwell “enjoyed to boast about her rendezvous with numerous lovers”.  “When she came back giddy as a schoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the develop up and enjoyment in her voice you ‘d think she was the next crown princess,” Giuffre composed. “But she had actually offered George Cooney a b ***** b in the restroom at some random occasion. She never let that one down.”  Clooney has yet to talk about the claims made by Giuffre, who has actually also claimed that she was required to have sex with Prince Andrew on three different occasions. In this exact same manuscript, Giuffre explained the supposed fetishes of the British royal.  “He liked my feet and even licked in between my toes,”Giuffre wrote of Andrew. Nevertheless, she went on to claim that “there was the lack of passion in the intimacy we shared, to him I was simply another lady, and to me, he was simply another job.”Epstein committed suicide in federal custody last summer while awaiting trial on various sex charges. Maxwell was jailed last month, and she has actually been remanded to a prison in New york city City up until her trial, which is arranged to occur next July. A judge purchased the 58-year-old British socialite to be remanded after figuring out that she positioned a considerable flight danger, offered her immense wealth and global connections.  Giuffre has actually implicated Maxwell of personally undressing her when she initially fulfilled Epstein as a teen.  “I was so scared thinking about disturbing and frustrating them, I do not know, it’s a strange situation without a doubt and I was anticipated to lick his nipples … and give him foreplay while he desired to fondle me,” she said. “Then at the end, I was told by Ghislaine to get on leading and straddle Jeffrey sexually, and when we were done, we went and had a shower in the room and Jeffrey told me to wash him up and down.”  This piece originally appeared in UpliftingToday.com and is utilized by approval.

99e1ce77,"This article has been updated to include more context about the directive as well as the commission’s defense of its policy. A new report points out that an executive branch agency called the Wisconsin Election Commission issued a directive in October telling local county election clerks that they can “fix” ballots by filling in missing addresses for witnesses. According to one former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice, the policy, which has been in place since October 2016, may violate a Wisconsin law requiring ballots to have a witness address to be validated. The commission has defended its policy, however, stating that the law “does not specify who affixes the address.” Wisconsin Statute 6.876d states, “If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted.” But in August, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a memo telling clerks they could fill in the address of the voter: To make sure your ballot is counted, double check the following before you return it: Your voter information: this section is usually completed by your clerk and includes the date of the election, the county and municipality in which you are registered, your name, the address where you are registered, city, and zip code. Voter Signature: you or your assistant must sign in the Certification of Voter section. Witness Signature and Address: your witness must sign and provide their full address, street number, street name, city in the Certification of Witness section. Make sure your ballot is in your envelope and make sure the envelope is sealed properly. If any of the required information above is missing, your ballot will not be counted. In October, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a directive to the state’s county clerks that seemed to allow them to fix incomplete or “spoiled” ballots missing witness signatures, writing, “Please note that the clerk should attempt to resolve any missing witness address information prior to Election Day if possible and this can be done through reliable information personal knowledge, voter registration information, through a phone call with the voter or witness. The witness does not need to appear to add a missing address.” As noted by Wisconsin Election Commission public information officer Reid Magney, the guidance has been in place since October 2016. “The guidance has been in effect for 11 statewide elections, including the 2016 presidential and presidential recount, and no one has objected to it until now,” said Magney, as reported by USA Today. An Oct. 18, 2016 memo from the commission reads in part formatting adjusted: [T]he Commission’s guidance is that municipal clerks shall do all that they can reasonably do to obtain any missing part of the witness address. Those steps may include one or more of the following options: 1. The clerk is able to reasonably discern the missing address or address component by information appearing on the envelope or from some other source, such as: The voter has provided his or her complete address and the clerk has personal knowledge that the witness resides at the same address as the voter. The clerk has personal knowledge of the witness and knows his/or her address. The voter’s complete address appears on the address label, and the witness indicates the same street address as the voter. The clerk is able to utilize lists or databases at his or her disposal to determine the witness’s address. 2. The voter or witness may wish to appear in person to add the missing information, or provide the address information by phone, fax, email or mail. The voter may provide the address separately as an alternative to returning the certificate envelope and having the voter mail it back again as outlined below. 3. The voter may request that the clerk return the certificate envelope so the voter can personally add the witness address. […] 4. The voter may wish to spoil the original ballot and vote a new one. Derek Muller, a professor of law at the Iowa School of Law, told Just The News, “This is a complication thing about elections like this. I’ve seen it in a lot of jurisdictions, what might be sort of a technical violation of the statute, in this case encouragement to county clerks about how to use their judgment on whether or not to cure a ballot.” Retired Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman told WISN, “The statute is very, very clear. If an absentee ballot does not have a witness address on it, it’s not valid. That ballot is not valid.” “In defiance of and direct contradiction to the statute, the Wisconsin Elections Commission gave guidance — that is, cover —to all 72 county clerks and turned the statute on its head,” said Gableman. “They said, ‘Gee, we know the law says an absentee ballot without the witness address is not valid, but county clerk, you have a duty to go ahead and look up on your own the witness’ address if there’s no address on the absentee ballot.’” The Wisconsin Election Commission, however, maintains that its policies are not in violation of the law, asserting that the law “does not specify who affixes the address” and noting that the addresses have been added to the certificates rather than the ballots themselves, as AFP reports.

Almost overnight, after months and months away from her constituents, she tries to trick us into believing she’s spent the past two decades in Washington representing us, as opposed to representing donors in California and New York who try to impose their agenda on the Badger State.  Senator Baldwin has made this deceitful campaign of tricking the people of our great state her focus. Wisconsin deserves better, and voters won’t fall for it again.

Senator Baldwin and her colleagues in Washington were given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform an outdated, broken and costly tax code that discouraged job growth and investment in America, failed to reward the middle-class or boost economic growth, and lined the pockets of Washington D.C. special interests, all at the expense of hard-working citizens and small businesses. She claims to support a “Buy America” philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words.  Instead of doing the right thing and voting for legislation that would have improved the lives of so many whose voices she is supposed to represent in Washington, Senator Baldwin did what she has done so often during her almost 30 years in public office: She played politics with the well-being and wallets of Wisconsin citizens. It was a desperate attempt to score cheap political points — and not so cheap campaign contributions — from her radical, far left supporters in faraway states.  Here in Wisconsin, it is estimated that a family of four will receive more than $2,500 per year in tax relief from the bill Senator Baldwin voted against. That extra $200 plus per month might not mean much to the liberal millionaires from New York and California whom she relies on to bankroll her campaigns, but it could change the lives of folks from Beloit to Superior, and everywhere in between.  Given the senator’s long history of only supporting policies championed by the far left and the coastal elite, it is no surprise she voted against a tax bill that will help so many Wisconsinites. In fact, she proudly joined large numbers from California, New York and New Jersey’s Congressional delegations in voting against more money in the pockets of Wisconsin families.  I have no doubt that Ms. Baldwin will soon be back to embark on one of her semiannual election-year tours, masquerading as “Wisconsin’s” senator. As she travels our great state, she ought to take the time and ask voters what they think about the extra income they’re receiving as a result of the tax bill. Senator Baldwin won’t like the answer, but least she’ll know a little bit more about the people of Wisconsin.

5cc316ba,"HOUSTON — In Texas, marijuana is illegal, and a Duke University study says using it can make you less smart.  For decades, researchers studied more than 1,000 people in New Zealand. They found teenagers who use marijuana at least four days a week lost 8 IQ points between the ages of 13 and 38.  Here's the key: that same thing didn't happen for people who heavily smoked marijuana only as adults. Heavy pot smokers did show deficits in memory, concentration and just overall brainpower. But all those effects were much worse among those who started lighting up as teens.  So is an 8-point IQ loss significant? Researchers say you bet. A person's long-term job prospects, job performance an income could be impacted, too.  Researchers can't say for certain marijuana is the sole reason those IQs took a hit. A competing study found a person's socioeconomic status could also be to blame for the IQ slide.  RELATED: Could marijuana law reform come to Texas this year?

cda49fa7,"Vaccine manufacturer Merck has abandoned development of two coronavirus vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing antibodies. The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection. The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482. The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus. “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug. Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed. Chief Marketing Officer Michael Nally recently told Bloomberg that Merck is aiming to produce some 20 million courses of the MK-4482 drug, an oral antiviral which patients will take twice a day for five days. Meanwhile, in related news, German scientists have claimed that the UK Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is less than 8% effective in over 65s, prompting the vaccine developers to hit back, rubbishing the claims. The German media published the claims, alleging it had been ‘confirmed’ by ‘multiple’ unnamed senior German government sources. UK government ministers have suggested that the claim could be related to the ongoing dispute over delivery of the vaccine between the European Union and AstraZeneca. The EU, which is yet to approve the vaccine, has threatened to block exports of shots to Britain, in a move that has been branded ‘spiteful’ by British government sources. In an effort to make sure its member states get their ‘fair share’ of vaccines, the EU has also threatened to block the delivery of Pfizer vaccines to the UK, demanding that drug companies provide detailed information on when they plan to export Covid jabs to countries outside the bloc.",Merck Scraps COVID Vaccines; Says It’s More Effective To Get The Virus And Recover,other

2e431d37,"Dr. Richard Bartlett, a Dallas MD who previously advised Governor Rick Perry for 7 years has a lifesaving COVID breakthrough, that Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Iceland are also using. The breakthrough is an inexpensive generic drug used to help asthmatics for more than 20 years, but the US and most of the world’s governments are using the WHO’s blind acceptance of the failed China strategy.  The deaths in every state, and every country could almost stop overnight if health professionals changed course immediately. For some reason, the NIH and CDC want to act as slow as molasses, but a small number of doctors are already doing this with their patients and they are seeing immediate success.  Will it work for every single patient? That remains to be seen, but many people who have used this protocol saw immediate results. This is the same path taken by Taiwan 24 million people, 7 deaths, Japan 126 million, 977 deaths, Singapore 5.6 million, 26 deaths Iceland 341,000 population, 10 deaths.  The Doctor and His Successes  Dr. Richard Bartlett has been practicing in Texas for 28 years. Gov. Perry asked him to be on the Health Disparities Task Force for two years, and he stayed for seven years. He is a regular CBS-TV health expert. He is also a medical author, who undertakes medical missions around the world.  Dr Bartlett says he is giving his COVID-19 patients an inhaled steroid, a standard asthma treatment. Not only is this treatment working, he says many of his patients see immediate results. For best effect, this generic medicine is administered through a nebulizer machine, not an inhaler.  100% of Dr. Bartlett’s patients are alive, and he has been using it since March, almost four months.  The Virus and The Medicine  COVID is a respiratory inflammatory disease so an effective medicine must address respiratory inflammation.  The medicine used by Dr. Bartlett is administered as part of a trio. First, there is an inhaled asthma medication, a steroid that costs $200 for the complete treatment. It is administered through a nebulizer, and it takes about 5 minutes. In addition, Dr. Bartlett gives an antibiotic to protect from secondary infection of pneumonia, and also zinc, which fights against virus multiplication.  Here is how Dr. Bartlett explains it. “You plug in the machine, put the pre-mixed, pre-measured medicine from the pharmacy into the [machine] reservoir and push the ‘on’ button. You breathe it for 5 minutes.”  “Patients tell me they feel better during the first treatment. Their chest pain goes away. Their shortness of breath goes away. Then their fever breaks.”  This very safe medicine has been used on millions of people, including premature babies and also fragile people in nursing homes, for more than 20 years. It has no cardiac risk.  Why This Works  Dr. Bertlett says “COVID is a respiratory virus that goes into the lungs, and binds with ACE receptors in the lungs. That triggers a cytokine storm inflammatory chemicals and enzymes all over the body.”  COVID kills some people if they are not treated. 50% of people get COVID but they don’t even know. For the 20% at risk, there are treatments that are already valid and working. Unfortunately, there are also failed protocols that are being used and repeated, killing people who did not need to die, had the right approach been taken, as Dr. Bartlett’s work shows.  “There is a lot of research on this medicine already and it is very safe,” Dr. Bartlett says.  The Patients  One of Dr. Bartlett’s patients has 2 types of lymphoma and is on chemotherapy. After being in bed at home with a fever for 5 days, she called him and he started her on the treatment that night. By the morning, her fever broke. She recovered over the weekend and worked a full day on Monday, and has since had two negative COVID tests.  Another of his patients has a 50-year history of smoking, and had quadruple bypass surgery. Even with high blood pressure and thyroid disease, this patient also had a positive result.  Why Repeat The Failed China Strategy?  The failed China strategy is being followed because the World Health Organization is promoting it. Some countries have already realized the failure and changed to the same winning strategy used by Dr. Bartlett.  Although the treatment used by Dr. Bartlett, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan works, and it is very low cost, the CDC and NIH allow very expensive experimental pharmaceuticals to be used by doctors.  The strategy Dr. Bartlett talks about is “Early Testing. Early Treatment.” This is the same strategy the U.S. uses for cancer, heart disease, stroke and other infections.  That is not the strategy promoted by WHO, which has praised the failed China strategy. Italy followed their strategy and more than 30,000 people died there.  The failed Chinese strategy is “wait until the house is burned 2/3 down and then seek help.” The USA, Australia , the UK and most other countries are currently using the failed China strategy of lockdown and late intervention. The US, at least has massively ramped up its testing regime.  Health Authority Advice  The advice of many health authorities is “Don’t seek help if you have mild-to-moderate symptoms. Wait until you have severe symptoms,” Dr Bartlett says.  Bartlett says some people go to the ER because they feel bad, but they are sent home with a positive test, and are told “Take Tylenol and tough it out at home.”  “That’s a terrible plan for any healthcare problem, especially one that can kill you,” Bartlett says.  Waiting For A Useless Vaccine  Dr. Fauci, the NIH, the CDC and governments around the world are pinning their hopes on a vaccine. That is a strategy doomed to failure because, just like influenza, viruses mutate all the time, and every year, the flu vaccine is changed. This is the reason entities like the Gates Foundation and Big Pharma love vaccines so much. They can make massive amounts of money, because it never ends – it is recurring income.  COVID-19 is just like the ‘flu that kills more than a million people every year. It is an inflammatory respiratory disease and there are already proven safe protocols to keep that kind of medical problem under control.  The fact that the course of action proposed by Dr. Bartlett costs $200 and some of the untested antivirals cost $30,000 plus a hospital stay says a lot about why some people push for a vaccine. People have been conditioned to believe an annual vaccine is the answer to every problem.  Dr. Bartlett’s Paper  In an effort to attract attention to this breakthrough information, Dr. Bartlett has written a paper that cites 51 other articles. The problem is that papers take months to be peer-reviewed and published. In the meantime, people continue to die. Doctors could use this safe protocol now, without waiting, if they knew about it. That’s the reason for this story – one more possibility of getting the information into the hands of people who can make a difference.  Dr. Bartlett isn’t sitting idle, either. He is doing his best to get this information out, but governments work very slowly. They always have and likely always will. While governments around the world dither, people die. Politicians are often protected from information like this, thanks to their staff, who decide what they see. We’re trying to get past those gatekeepers, and would appreciate your help.  This protocol may not work in every case, but the halting of new deaths in Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore shows that it is thousands of times better than what is happening in the U.S. and most other countries today. The key is early action.  To hear the complete interview with Dr. Richard Bartlett by Debbie Georgatos on “America Can We Talk,” watch the video below.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Tens of thousands of families face being made homeless and thrown into poverty because of the new benefits cap, campaigners warn.  From tomorrow the total amount of benefits a household can receive will be cut from £26,000 to £23,000 in London and to £20,000 in the rest of the country.  Charities have warned the new measures will leave 112,000 families responsible for 320,000 children up to £115 a week worse off.  The reduction in the cap will also hit an estimated 42,000 single parents.  The Children’s Society says the harsher rules could lead to more families being made homeless and forced to move away from their children’s friends and schools.  “There are already 3.9million children living in poverty across Britain and the new cap is likely to cause that total to rise. Children’s health, well-being and mental health could all be put at risk,” the Society says.  More than one in ten families affected by the cap are unable to work because of caring responsibilities or disability or long-term sickness.  Matthew Reed, Chief Executive of The Children’s Society, said: “Given the Prime Minister’s aspiration of making Britain a country that works for everyone, it is deeply disappointing that the Government is pushing ahead with an ongoing agenda of cuts to financial support for children in low-income families.  Making savings by cutting help for the poorest children is unnecessary and unfair.  Image: Getty Images  “This is a blunt instrument trying to solve a complex problem.  The policy is targeted at workless adults, but the reality is that children are considerably more likely than adults to lose out and there is nothing fair about trying to balance the books on the backs of poor children.  “We fully support efforts to make work pay, but it is not right to achieve this by putting more children on the breadline.  Even at this late stage we would urge ministers to exclude children’s benefits from the cap so that children and their already struggling families do not suffer even more hardship.  “At the same time the Government should provide better incentives for families to move into work by reversing recent cuts to support for working families in Universal Credit.”  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams MP said: “Despite Theresa May’s warm words on the steps of No 10, when she said she wanted to help families who are ‘just managing’, she is allowing the reduction of the so-called ‘benefit cap’ to go ahead. From 7th November, more than 116,000 households will be affected including 320,000 children.  “Charities are warning of an escalation of homelessness which currently includes over 100,000 children living in temporary accommodation. Widows and widowers, veterans and disabled people up and down the country will lose up to £100 per week.”  Rehana Azam, the national secretary of the GMB union, added: “Just four months ago, Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street promising to fight injustice and to ensure every person regardless of their background would be given the chance to be all they want to be.  Today she is unleashing a monstrous new assault on 40,000 single mothers, which risks shattering the life chances of children up and down our country.”  Image: REUTERS  “This has echoes of the staggering hypocrisy and chilling callousness that saw the victimisation of single mothers in the bad old days of the early 1990s. Theresa May once said she would change the ‘nasty party’ but the mask has slipped again.”  A Department for Work and Pensions pointed to statistics showing that more than 23,000 households who previously had their benefits capped had since found work.  Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green said: “Each statistic represents a person who has moved into employment and can now enjoy the security and dignity that works brings.  “By making sure that those people who are out of work are faced with the same choices as those who are in work, the benefit cap has been a real success.  “By lowering the cap today, we are ensuring the values of this Government continue to chime with those of ordinary working people and delivering on our commitment to make sure work pays more than welfare”.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies IFS economic think tank said the new benefit cap would “almost exclusively affects families with large numbers of children or very high rents or both.”  The IFS also said more than half of those affected would have “at least four children.”  “For those families who are affected, the impact can be large. Households who are already capped will lose a further £3,000 per year in London or £6,000 per year elsewhere,” the IFS said.  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: “Theresa May said one thing on Downing Street and is now robbing some of the poorest families of £6,000. She just mislead the British public and is now clobbering those who can afford it least. It’s makes her party look like hypocrites.  “How can the Conservatives do this and call themselves the workers party? It’s disgraceful.”",Benefit cap will leave tens of thousands more children in poverty in 'monstrous new assault' on families,FALSE
1aab4af3,"No matter how strictly mask laws are enforced nor the level of mask compliance the population follows, cases all fall and rise around the same time.  Masks have become a political tool and a talisman. When COVID-19 hit, governments panicked and created enormous fear. The Centers for Disease Control currently estimates a COVID-19 survival rate of 99.99 percent for people younger than 50, but the damage created by the panic was too great to undo.  It is likely that some politicians eventually realized their mistake and needed a way to back-pedal without admitting their lockdowns were a policy disaster. Their solution was for people to put any old piece of cloth across their face and magically believe that it’s okay to go out shopping again.  Masks are not merely a small inconvenience. They have inadvertently become a key impediment to returning to a more normal life, a desirable goal for those seeking to twist the pandemic for political and electoral purposes.  Masks dehumanize us, and ironically serve as a constant reminder that we should be afraid. People can now be spotted wearing masks while camping by themselves in the woods or on a solo sailing trip. They have become a cruel device on young children everywhere, kindergarten students covered by masks and isolated by Plexiglas, struggling to understand the social expressions of their peers. Face coverings are causing real harm to the American psyche, provide little to no medical benefit, and distract us from more important health policy issues.  The mask dogma had many cracks in it from the start. For one, the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control both previously said that “masks are NOT effective in preventing [the] general public from catching coronavirus,” so they were already starting with a credibility deficit. Furthermore, many officials have been frequently caught without masks when they think the cameras are off them. Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, has been caught doing this multiple times.  Chicago’s mayor and local media were all caught taking off their masks and violating social distancing as soon as a press conference ended. This was caught in a now deleted YouTube video that was shared by a now deleted Twitter account after being retweeted more than 26,000 times. As of the date of this publication, it is still available to view in a crude video of a video that has yet to be deleted on YouTube.  Clearly, some people do not want you to see what politicians do behind the scenes. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a strong advocate for mandatory masking, was caught off camera laughing about how wearing masks is an act of “political theater.”  Faking ‘Science’ to Achieve Political Goals  These same politicians and health officials are so desperate to make people believe in masks that they doctor charts to make their case, even when their own data actually undermines them. So what is the actual science behind masks? Let’s begin by reviewing the leading scientific studies.  The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University summarized six international studies which “showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.” Oxford went on to say that “that despite two decades of pandemic preparedness, there is considerable uncertainty as to the value of wearing masks.” They prophetically warned that this has “left the field wide open for the play of opinions, radical views and political influence.”  A study of health-care workers in more than 1,600 hospitals showed that cloth masks only filtered out 3 percent of particles. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine stated, “[W]earing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection” and that “[T]he desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.”  There are many other credible studies showing lack of mask efficacy, such as studies published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Cambridge University Press, Oxford Clinical Infectious Diseases, and Influenza Journal, just to name a few.  Studies do show masks can help in the case of direct respiratory droplets, which would matter if somebody is coughing, breathing, or sneezing directly on your face. That happens normally in a tight and highly confined space.  But the plentiful evidence we have indicates masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission, where two people are just in the same area, or even the same room. This is because the two people end up breathing the same air, with or without a mask, as visually demonstrated in this video.  Now for Graphs about International Mask Mandates  Historical scientific studies do not make a compelling case that universal masking would meaningfully help, so let’s explore real-world situations to see where data leads us.  Austria was one of the first governments to require masks, and it did so about 10 days after its cases began to go down. The level of downtrend did not change or improve after masks were required. After the nation’s people wearing masks for an extended period, cases are currently four times where they were when Austria mandated masks, and cases continue to climb.  Germany mandated masks about halfway down its original recovery. Their cases are now similarly climbing quickly.  The French now have around 1,000 percent more daily cases they had when they mandated masks, despite having one of the highest mask compliance levels in the world.  Spain was not far behind its French neighbor with a mandate. Spain required masks when cases were near zero and has the highest compliance with mask-wearing in all Europe. Now Spain is at around 1,500 percent the level of cases compared to when it mandated masks.  After three months of requiring masks, the United Kingdom is at around 1,500 percent more cases despite having one of the highest mask compliance records in Europe.  Belgium required masks shortly after the British did, and now possibly has the highest rate of cases in the world.  Italy had extremely high levels of mask-wearing despite no national mandate. Recently skyrocketing cases finally compelled them to create one of the strictest mask laws in the world, but the results have predictably failed to slow the rise in coronavirus cases. In fact, cases skyrocketed immediately after the mask mandate went into effect.  Similar results have been found in Ireland, Portugal, Israel, and many other countries. No matter how strictly mask laws are enforced nor the level of mask compliance the population follows, cases all fall and rise around the same time.  How about the United States? Americans have proven to be highly compliant with mask wearing, even higher than the Germans.  It is therefore no surprise that the same trends found in Europe are also found in U.S. states. For example, California required masks in June but cases still went up by more than 300 percent and the state remains heavily locked down four months later with still higher cases.  Hawaii suffered one of the most economically devastating lockdowns of all the U.S. states. It was also an early mover on mandating masks both indoors and outdoors, but cases still went up by almost 1,000 percent.  With and without mask mandates, Texas and Georgia followed nearly identical case development.  For those more interested in comparing deaths than cases, we again don’t see a pattern of masks meaningfully helping.  Why Don’t Masks Work?  Why don’t masks work on the general public? For one, if you read the fine print on most consumer masks you will see something along the line of “not intended for medical purposes and has not been tested to reduce the transmission of disease.” Masks can work well when they’re fully sealed, properly fitted, changed often, and have a filter designed for virus-sized particles. This represents none of the common masks available on the consumer market, making universal masking much more of a confidence trick than a medical solution.  If we actually wanted effective masks, then manufacturers should be conducting scientific tests evaluating masks specifically for their ability to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration and CDC should be making recommendations on which masks to use and approving masks based on their scientific efficacy rather than promoting the wrapping of any piece of miscellaneous cloth around your face.  Many powerful institutions have too much political capital invested in the mask narrative at this point, so the dogma is perpetuated.  Effective masks, if they exist, should then be distributed to highly vulnerable groups for use only in rare and extenuating circumstances. There would be little point for the population at large to wear masks all the time because while focused protection may be possible, it is not possible to eradicate the virus at this point or stop its spread.  Our universal use of unscientific face coverings is therefore closer to medieval superstition than it is to science, but many powerful institutions have too much political capital invested in the mask narrative at this point, so the dogma is perpetuated. The narrative says that if cases go down it’s because masks succeeded. It says that if cases go up it’s because masks succeeded in preventing more cases. The narrative simply assumes rather than proves that masks work, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.  The narrative further ignores places like Sweden and Georgia, which never required masks in the first place, and it suppresses new scientific evidence if it doesn’t support desired political results, such as data from the world’s only randomized trial investigating if masks actually protect from COVID-19. Even a Nobel laureate has been canceled because his COVID charts and data were found to be undesirable.  History does not bode well for times that politics meddles with science. Martin Kulldorff, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in disease surveillance methods and infectious disease outbreaks, describes the current COVID scientific environment this way: “After 300 years, the Age of Enlightenment has ended.”  In the end, it will be the loss of credibility in our scientific institutions, and the unnecessary division they have sowed among us, for which masks will be remembered.",These 12 Graphs Show Mask Mandates Do Nothing To Stop COVID,FALSE
c9c6869b,"Washington – U.S. Congressman David Cicilline D-RI, who has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act in the House, today called on House Republicans to help close the wage gap that still exists between women and men in the workforce.  “Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace. It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market,” said Cicilline.  In January 2009, the Democratic-led 111th Congress sent to the President’s desk the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act – and it became the first bill signed into law by President Obama. This Act, a great victory for women, restores the right of women to challenge unfair pay in court – but virtually all House Republicans rejected this critical measure for women. Cicilline, who was sworn into office in January 2011, has continued to press for additional measures to protect equal pay for women.  “While the Lilly Ledbetter Act marked a significant achievement there is still more work to be done. I am a proud cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would enhance the remedies available under the Equal Pay Act to better to better equip women fighting against wage discrimination. Although the House Republican leadership has failed to consider this measure, I will continue to stand up with the other members of our state’s delegation to promote progress for Rhode Island women and their families,” added Cicilline.  This year, Equal Pay Day also falls on Tax Day. Just as Cicilline is fighting to achieve equal pay for women in the workforce, he is also fighting for basic fairness in the tax code. While women are struggling in the workplace with unfair pay, it adds insult to injury that many workers with modest incomes are actually paying a higher tax rate than their well-paid bosses. That is why Congressman Cicilline, who authored a letter to Speaker Boehner last week urging the House to enact a “Buffett Rule,” today reiterated the importance of ensuring that multimillion dollar earners no longer pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than middle class Rhode Island families.",Cicilline Marks Equal Pay Day By Stressing Importance of Closing Wage Gap Between Women and Men,partially false

fbbca6e5,"The Amish are a group of traditional Christian people with Swiss origins. They rarely receive vaccines, and they rarely come down with diseases like cancer, autism or heart disease. Coincidence? Let’s dig deeper and find out.  All parents want best for their children, and I think we can all agree that we should be raising the absolute healthiest and brightest children we possibly can. Afterall, children are our future, so we owe it to them and to humanity to take an honest, logical look at this issue.  Getting Real About Vaccines  For me there are a number of things I see happening with the vaccine industry that make me skeptical of their products, intentions and competency when it comes to human health.  Here are a few red flags for me when it comes to vaccines:  Flu shots contain multiple neurotoxins at very high concentrations.  Influenza Virus Vaccine contains 25,000x higher levels of mercury than what the EPA says is safe in drinking water.  Flu shots are not backed by any safety trials or efficacy data.  Patients are not given the potential risks associated with vaccines  Pharmaceutical companies pushing vaccines have absolute legal immunity against anybody claming their products caused damage. Yikes!  By this logic, adding snake venom to vaccines would make them even healthier. Sorry but I don’t buy it!  The fact that we’re injecting neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals into the youngest and most vulnerable among us – our children – dozens of times before they reach the age of 6 is particularly concerning. Medical frauds are not uncommon – is it far fetched at all to suggest we’re witnessing another one take place?  If the government and vaccine industries truly cared about our health, wouldn’t vaccines contain things like vitamins, ocean mineral blends, flavonoids and other plant extracts that have been proven to boost immunity rather than infected animal tissue and harsh poisons like mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum?  The Rising Epidemic of Autism  Sharp increases in the number of vaccines given to children over the past two decades have occurred in direct proportion to increased cases of autism spectrum disorder ASD. Every jab contributes to increased accumulation of poisons in the brain of children, causing widespread brain and bodily damage that is often labelled and officially diagnosed as autism.  Vaccines Synergize with Glyphosate Sprays on Food  Another thing to be aware of is the synergistic negative effects these chemicals have when combined with genetically modified foods containing the active ingredient roundup.  Studies have shown that glyphosate inhibits every single one of the 50 cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for detoxification in the human body.  For people eating the standard American diet, it’s almost impossible to avoid eating these poisons sprayed on GMO food. When a person receives vaccines, then consumes glyphosate-containing herbicide sprays, the excretion of the chemicals from both the vaccines and from food will be inhibited, maximizing and extending the duration of their harmful effects.  The Amish Opt Out of Vaccines and Rarely Develop Autism  When you compare Autism rates among the Amish community to the US national average, you can expect to find about 200 children with Autism. Yet if you take a trip to the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, you wouldn’t even find yourself 6 Amish children with autism.  Why not? Because to date, there are only 3 diagnosed cases of autism among the Amish, and one of those cases is in a child who was adopted from China. Another Amish child diagnosed with autism was diagnosed after being vaccinated.  Let’s take a look at some of the worldwide and US national statistics regarding Autism to learn more about this recent phenomenon:  Autism affects over 20 million people worldwide  Autism occurs in boys four to five times more often than in girls  One of every 68 children has some form of ASD in the US  US Autism rates have increased 38% since 2012.  Researchers like Dr. Stephanie Senoff of MIT have predicted rates of autism will be 1 in 2 in the US by 2025.  This spike in the number of cases of autism over the past two decades in the US coincide directly with the vaccine schedule increase, by quantity and frequency, that is being enforced by the CDC.  Today, US children receive an alarming 50 innoculations before age 7, many of them containing various combinations of diseases, mercury, formaldehyde, known neurotoxins like monosodium glutamate and aluminum.  Flu shots contain the highest levels of mercury of all jabs – up to 25,000 times greater than what the EPA allows in drinking water or in fish sold as food. Are you aware that the CDC’s own statistics have shown that children who receive mercury-containing vaccinations in the form of thimerosal are 27 times more likely to develop autism than those who don’t get jabs?  Formaldehyde is a carcinogen that coroners soak dead people in to ensure their body’s don’t decay. Do you really want to inject this into yourself or your child?  You may be confused why your family doctor would recommend vaccines and claim they are safe and effective despite all of this – unfortunately, doctor’s are human too and they only know what they’ve been taught. Always do your own research, think for yourself and come to your own conclusions.  For Religious Reasons, the Amish opt out of all vaccines  The Amish are lucky because opting out of all vaccines means they’ve avoided three highly-controversial vaccines involved in the biggest medical cover-up in history – hepatitis B, HPV and the MMR.  Here’s the cole’s notes version for the Hep B vaccine cover-up: The CDC claimed that thimerosal 50% mercury was removed from the multi-dose version of the hepatitis B vaccine, but they lied.  The vulnerable central nervous systems of the young Amish are spared the onslaught of this volatile toxin thanks to their parent’s unwillingness to believe unquestioningly what they’re told by authorities. As a result, Amish children rarely experience learning disabilities, as well as common US diseases like cancer, heart disease and diabetes.  Of course, there are a number of factors, like eating cleaner food that’s not soaked in toxic herbicides containing glyphosate and others and generally they tend to avoid pharmaceutical drugs. Why won’t the government fund a study comparing Amish health with non-Amish health?  Despite the reality we see around us, and the many red flags when it comes to vaccine safety and efficacy, the CDC refuses to regulate the vaccine industry. As a result, the health of our children and our neighbor’s children are put in the hands of the immoral few in the upper class of society.  Conclusion  Our best strategy to find the truth about vaccines is to compare the health of groups of people who have received vaccines with groups of people who have not. The Amish are a shining example of health and they are almost exclusively unvaccinated. Therefore, it’s plain to see that vaccines are not only not helping people, but based on the long list of severe side effects, including brain damage, autism spectrum disorder ASD, paralysis, and death, that the existing vaccines being pushed hard by the government and corporations profiting from them are, overall, doing far more harm than good.  Considering some of the most potent anti-carcinogens, contained within common foods like oranges or coconuts, are readily absorbed and available through dietary means, even if we were to formulate the absolute best nutrient-based vaccines, vaccines probably still wouldn’t be needed.  If you truly want immunity, eating clean foods raised with maximum nutrition in mind is a good starting point. Even better, make it your goal to make your escape from the destructive, toxic city life and begin growing as much of your own food as possible for yourself and your family.

Donald Trump is a great man that has done the most of any president for black people. Black unemployment is way down, crime is lower, everything is better under Trump.

Despite an increase in employment, in-work poverty has gone up because of low pay and not enough hours of work/  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation JRF’s ‘state of the nation’ report on poverty found 56% of people in poverty are in a working family, compared to 39% 20 years ago.  Poverty has also increased for children and pensioners over the last five years, according to the research group.  The JRF research shows 14m people are living in poverty, including 4m children and 2m pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years.  Union leaders said the findings showed a pressing need to ban zero-hour contracts and increase the minimum wage and head teachers said the country’s record on poverty was “truly shocking.”  Are you a struggling parent? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk  The highest poverty rates were in London, the North of England, the Midlands and Wales, and lowest were in the South, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the study.  The differences in poverty rates were often driven by the availability of good quality jobs and housing costs.  People were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.  JRF is urging the government to improve job security and quality, see the benefits system as an essential public service that loosens the grip of poverty, and help make more low-cost housing available.  Image: Julian Hamilton/Daily Mirror  Claire Ainsley, JRF executive director, said: “The new Government has an historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s.  “Past successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.  “Millions of families care for each other, raise their children and work hard without any guarantee that they will escape poverty, governments, employers and landlords all have a role to play in changing this.  “It’s not right that so many are unable to build a firm foundation to their lives because their jobs are insecure or they can’t find a home they can afford.  “Without a better deal for working families, and a social security system that provides a public service for all of us, the UK faces further division and deeper poverty.  “That better deal needs to encompass the basics we all need, from building new homes to funding social security and bringing better jobs to all parts of the country.”  Image: Getty Images  Frances O’Grady, TUC general secretary, said: “The Government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs.  “Zero hours contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least £10 an hour right away.”  JRF said the poverty indicator it used is when a family has an income of less than 60% of median income for their family type, after housing costs.  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, which found in a poll of members last year that 83% had seen an increase in the number of children coming to school hungry in the last five years, said: “School leaders are seeing more and more hardworking families struggling, and more children living in poverty.  “This country’s record on child poverty is truly shocking. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds have disproportionately suffered from cuts not just to education, but to all the wider services that should be there to help them.  “Successive governments have failed to invest in those who need it the most. This government must have the confidence to change that record.  “Schools are at the centre of efforts to improve equality of opportunity. But the issues that underpin inequality reach far beyond the school gates and exist throughout the communities that schools serve. Inequality will remain entrenched in the UK unless the government takes urgent action to break the grip of poverty.”",Britain's shame as poverty skyrockets with children and pensioners worst hit,FALSE

Last night retailers reported that sales had soared by nearly 50 per cent as consumers snap up any remaining stock in the run-up to the Brussels diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts.  Many stores and websites have already run out of the most powerful models, with one reporting its busiest day for sales in more than a decade.  Scroll down for video  Stampede: Shoppers are panic-buying powerful vacuum cleaners to beat an EU ban coming into force next week. Above, some of models that will be affected by the ban  The buying frenzy looks set to intensify today and tomorrow, before the official ban on importing or manufacturing the machines takes effect on Monday.  And Brussels is now considering measures to ban the most powerful hairdryers, lawn mowers and electric kettles, it was revealed.  A list of up to 30 high-wattage household devices could be banned next spring following a draft EU report which examined ways to reduce power consumption.  Consumer magazine Which? said the new rules on vacuum cleaners would outlaw some of the best machines, which owe their strong suction ability to their high power consumption.  A previous story on the Brussels ban, as reported in the Mail on August 23, 2014  From September 1, companies will be prohibited from manufacturing or importing any vacuum cleaners above the 1,600-watt limit as part of a drive to reduce domestic electricity use.  Tesco yesterday said it saw sales rocket by 44 per cent over the past two weeks as panicked customers rushed to get their hands on popular 2,000-watt models.  The Cooperative Electrical shop reported a rise of 38 per cent, while at Currys some models of powerful vacuums were sold out.  Online electrical retailer ao.com said sales were up 40 per cent last week compared with the same period last year and last Friday it had its best ever day for vacuum cleaner sales in the 14 years it has been trading.  Tesco planning manager Louise Rix said: ‘The EU ban has been a much debated topic over the last few days – it’s certainly provoked a lot of interest amongst consumers and manufacturers.  ‘We’ve seen huge sales increases of vacuums and we expect the high demand to continue over the next two days before the ban comes into place.’  The ban from Monday on powerful vacuum cleaners has angered manufacturers, who say it will do nothing to make machines more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the home.  Critics say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power but householders will have to use them for longer – so they are likely to use the same amount of electricity in the long run.  For the first time, vacuum cleaners will have to carry ratings from A to G for energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors, and dust emissions.  Measures: The buying frenzy looks set to intensify today and tomorrow, before the official ban on importing or manufacturing powerful vacuum cleaners left takes effect on Monday. And Brussels is now considering measures to ban the most powerful hairdryers, lawn mowers right, file picture and electric kettles, it was revealed  Yesterday, there was evidence that consumers are stockpiling their favourite models to use in the decades to come.  Chris Wesson, posted a photograph on Twitter of two 2,000-watt Panasonic vacuums which he said his mother had bought.  He tweeted the comment: ‘Only my mum would stock up on powerful vacuum cleaners before this ban comes into effect. We now have five in our house...’  But Leanne Beswick, of ao.com, said there was no need to panic buy – and that lower wattage does not necessarily equate to a poorer performing machine.  ‘We have seen a significant surge in sales of corded vacuums over 1600 watts over the weekend as the deadline for meeting new EU legislation looms on September 1,’ she said. ‘However, consumers need not panic buy.  Consumers are snapping up any remaining stock in the run-up to the diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts. Above, the European Commission's headquarters  ‘Even though these particular models will eventually be off the market, this doesn’t mean that new and other existing models are any less effective – they are not. Although they may need to lose power to conform to the new regulations, they won’t lose performance.’  A Currys & PC World spokesperson said: 'We still have a good stocks of high powered vacuum cleaners at great prices. We will however be adding new products to our range with the best technology that adhere to the new energy and performance ruling.  'These new ranges are built with state of the art engineering with the same high standards to ensure customers reap the benefits without compromising quality.'  While the ban comes into place on Monday, retailers will still be able to sell their remaining stock after this date.  We expect the high demand to continue over the next two days before the ban comes into place Louise Rix, Tesco  Last week consumer watchdog Which? warned that many of the best models that appear in its Best Buy tables will be taken off the market as a result of the new EU rule.  Of seven awarded ‘Best Buy’ status since January 2013, five have motors with a power of more than 1,600 watts, it said.  The maximum wattage will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017. Current cleaners have an average wattage of 1,800.  Which? said: ‘If you’re in the market for a powerful vacuum, you should act quickly, before all of the models currently available sell out. A best buy 2,200-watt vac costs around £27 a year to run in electricity – only £8 more than the best-scoring 1,600-watt we’ve tested.’  Marlene Holzner, the European Commission’s energy spokesman, said the amount of wattage does not automatically indicate how well a vacuum will perform.",Vacuums panic buying hits shops as deadline looms for Brussels ban,partially false

4c911969,"Texas state Rep. Dan FlynnR has proposed a bill called the Teacher’s Protection Act H.B.868. It would allow teachers to use deadly force on school property, a school bus, or at an event sponsored by a school either in self-defense or defense of students at the school. Teachers would also be allowed to use guns while defending school property. In addition, teachers who shot someone under such circumstances would be granted “civil immunity,” which means they could not be held liable if the student they shot was injured or killed. Teachers in Texas already have the right to keep guns in the classroom.  Flynn is a strong supporter of gun rights. He has worked on pieces of legislation that permitted people to have guns on college campuses and that reduced the required minimum number of hours of training for a concealed handgun license.  Gun advocates have been demanding that teachers be armed ever since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 that resulted in 20 fatalities. Gun control advocates, however, state that easy access to guns increases crime. Psychologists also note that easy access to guns increases the chance of somebody getting shot during an emotionally charged confrontation.  Civil rights organizations also oppose the bill. They point out that black and Latino students are already more likely to be disciplined harshly at school than are their white classmates. They are more likely to be suspended or expelled. Civil rights activists worry that since students of color are already being targeted for their behavior by school authorities, they would be more likely to be the victims of gun-wielding teachers than their white peers.

8e1c39c2,"FEMA “Smart” Guillotines Placed in FEMA Internment Camps video  % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.  If all information is accurate, the Deep State, using FEMA as its agent of evil, is expediting plans to herd humans into internment camps. The acquisition of smart guillotines is a portent of the Deep State’s hatred of America, the American people, and of the document—the Constitution—our forefathers authored to protect us from the wicked machinations of the very government we elected into office.  “All states have them, but Texas got the majority right now,” our source said.  The 500 units were sent to FEMA camps near Austin, a New World Orderin Waco, and a FEMA internment camp disguised as a water treatment facility in Carrolton.  “FEMA’s main focus is on Texas. All eyes on Texas. If there’s going to be a public insurrection, they know the battle lines will be dawn in Texas. They know the patriot community is thick in Texas. That’s why Texas is receiving more of these smart guillotines than any other state. FEMA’s first strike will occur in Texas,” our source said.  The Andrews AFB shipment—over 500 smart guillotines–was distributed by rail to FEMA zone six, an area encompassing Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Belgrade, and Arkansas, primarily “red” states likely to resist a declaration of Martial Law or a military incursion against the American people.  After Obama left office, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security kept the smart guillotine project alive, using slush funds and black project money to fund three thousand of the villainous devices, each of which reportedly cost seventeen million dollars. FEMA ordered them from the Chinese, our source added, because the agency “felt guilty” about using Made-in-America products to execute Americans. In addition, the Chinese versions are less costly.  “The Deep State, and by association FEMA, recognized that some of its own people’s heads might accidentally wind up on the chopping block. They had to devise a way to stop the blade from lopping off friendly heads. So, when a person is face down waiting for the blade to fall, the computer scans the face and iris. If it matches a friendly face stored in a database, the blade won’t fall, and the person is set free,” our source said.  If a person resists, arm and leg restraints spring forth from recessed compartments, rendering the victim immobile. Moreover, the smart guillotines employ biometric scanning, including facial recognition technology to exonerate persons mistakenly placed on the guillotine for execution.  For example, the headrest has motion sensors and pressure plates that detect the presence of a human neck. No operator is needed; a computer drops and retracts a razor-sharp weighted titanium blade, which, our source said, can sever several hundred heads per sharpening.  The condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame, positioning the neck directly below the blade. The blade is then released, to quickly fall and forcefully decapitate the victim with a single, clean pass so that the head falls into a basket below. The smart guillotine retains the basic design while adding several scientific advancements.  The guillotine gained popularity during the French Revolution. The device consists of a tall, upright frame in which a weighted and angled blade is raised to the top and suspended.  He said the smart guillotine project was commissioned in 2011, at the request of former president Barrack Hussein Obama, who had hoped during his term toand use the deadly apparatus against patriots and freedom fighters that challenged his one-world government agenda. The guillotine, he added, is the ideal method of execution for instilling fear among the masses.  The technologically advanced guillotines, he said, are being manufactured in Beijing before being flown exclusively to US airbases. Then, the military distributes the guillotines to FEMA camps nationwide.  A United States Air force C-17 cargo plane arrived at Andrews Air Force Base loaded with crates of “smart” guillotines, says a White House insider speaking under condition of anonymity.

701c81d1,"NEW REPORT AHEAD OF TAX DAY: Corporations Hit More Than $250 Billion In Stock Buybacks in 2018, Overwhelmingly Benefitting Executives And Wealthy Shareholders—Not Workers  As millions of Americans finish preparing their taxes, corporate executives are laughing all the way to the bank thanks to the Republican tax bill. In 2018 alone, major corporations have authorized more than $250 billion in corporate stock buyback schemes .

c70fd1b6,"Science once again catching up with what many already knew – but this is progress: A new scientific study has investigated the toxicity of various drugs and found Marijuana the clear winner. It’s been found significantly less toxic than all the other substances on the list – including not only illegal drugs but the LEGAL alcohol and tobacco. Here’s our full report.  Claims on marijuana’s medicinal values have been widely debated despite support from medical research and study. Federal legislations that govern marijuana use aim to restrict rather than regulate – and this has posed a problem to people seeking the medicinal and recreational effects of the herb, very far from intentions of abusing its effects. What is it about marijuana that scares the government – and the public – so much?  Marijuana Use in the United States  Marijuana, colloquially referred to as weed or pot, is made up of dried leaves and flowers of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. Statistics released by the National Institute of Drug Abuse reveal that in respondents aged 18 to 25, more than half exactly 51.90 percent have used marijuana. Percentages are lower in the other two age groups, with 16.40 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 and 45.70 percent of respondents aged 26 and older reporting marijuana use. [1]  Laws in more than half the number of states in the US prohibit marijuana use, whether recreationally or medically. Currently 2015, only 21 states plus the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws MMLs that recognize and permit the medicinal use of the herb. [2]  Numerous studies have reported the positive medicinal effects of marijuana on pain, sleep, and overall comfort. A survey conducted by Trip, et. al. 2014 revealed that marijuana use was effective in improving mood, pain, muscle spasms, and sleep quality in patient with prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. [3] The data collected from a more recent study in 2015 by Degenhardt, et. al. revealed that marijuana use in conjunction with prescribed opioids were able to induce effective pain relief in respondents experiencing chronic non-cancer pain. [4] These studies further support the popularity of marijuana use among people experiencing acute and chronic pain.  On the other hand, there have also been studies on the adverse effects of marijuana. One of these was published in mid-2014, focusing the negative health effects of smoking marijuana, particularly on the increased risk for lung cancer. [5] Of course, the study was only able to reveal how it was smoke not cannabis itself that damages lung tissue. This problem could easily be solved by changing the method in which marijuana is administered.  Risk Assessment of Marijuana and Other Substances  But is marijuana use as dangerous as the law makes it out to be? The intoxicating effects of marijuana, although different, are not thought more severe than that of mild to moderate alcohol intake – a substance that is not illegal anywhere in the United States, or most countries all over the world. A study published in January 2015 by Lechenmeier and Rehm [6] assessed the comparative risk between different “mind-altering” substances, specifically alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drugs like heroin. Surprisingly, the study revealed that cannabis was the least risky substance, belonging to the other end of the spectrum. Do you know what substance was revealed the most risky? Alcohol.  How is this possible? The study used an approach called the Margin of Exposure MOE which is drastically different from other studies that simply attempted to find causational relationship between two factors – 1 substance use/abuse and 2 mortality. MOE is different; it’s a ratio between the estimated average human intake and the benchmark dose or toxicological threshold. Basically, it’s a ratio between how much humans typically intake and the dose at which the substance becomes dangerous – which is a better judge of how risky a substance can be. The higher the MOE is, the higher its spot on the list.  The results of the study were conclusive: The highest spot belonged to alcohol, while the succeeding spots were filled by heroin, cocaine, nicotine, MDMA, methamphetamine, methadone, amphetamine, diazepam, and THC or marijuana. With marijuana in the lowest spot over 100 times less toxic than alcohol, it can be surmised that its effects on health and society have been largely overestimated. If there was a plant that couldn’t be more misunderstood – or was it perhaps intentionally maligned – it has to be marijuana.  It’s important to note that the study measured toxic effects and does not consider any social effects of the use of the drug. However, this result is a clear indication that policies on marijuana are outdated and need re-evaluation – which is something that is gradually happening. It’s good news for the herband for the use of herbs in general.  References:  [1] National Institute of Drug Abuse 2014. Marijuana.

cd978f09,"RFK, Jr.: Gardasil “The Science” Video and Other Facts  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.—“Many of the things I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they weren’t true. And, if they are not true, then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that. And they won’t do that because in the United States, truth is an absolute defense against slander.”  This must-watch video details the many problems with the development and safety of Merck’s third-highest grossing product, Gardasil. Children’s Health Defense CHD and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CHD’s Chairman and Chief Legal Counsel, ask that you watch and share this video so that you, and others, may make an informed decision of whether or not to give your child, boy or girl, a Gardasil vaccine. It can also be a useful tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine, that is actually causing health problems with young people, could have been approved by FDA and then recommended by CDC. The video is full of jaw-dropping facts about Gardasil and the clinical trials leading up to its release upon an unsuspecting public.  Transcript of “The Science” presentation:  Download “The Science” Transcript  Children’s Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Science Day Presentation for Gardasil  Hi, I’m Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and I’m making this video for the sake of parents who are trying to make an informed decision of whether or not to give their child, their boy or girl the Gardasil vaccine.  I’m also making this video as a tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine—if it’s actually causing all of these problems with young girls—could have been approved by FDA and then mandated by CDC.  Virtually all of the things that I’m going to talk about in this video are available to the public on public documents as I’m going to show.  Finally, I want to say this about Merck which is the company that makes the Gardasil vaccine.  Many of the things that I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they were not true. And if they’re not true then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that and they won’t do it because in the United States truth is an absolute defense to slander. And second of all Merck knows that if they sue me, I’m going to immediately file a discovery request, and many, many, more documents are going to emerge that illustrate even more fraud by this company on the American public and the people all over the world.  Finally, as a footnote I’m not going to talk today about the specific biological mechanisms that allow this vaccine to cause harm in human beings. That information is out there it’s in dozens of peer-reviewed, published scientific documents. Many of these are described on our website and I urge people to go to the Children’s Health Defense website to educate themselves on those issues.  Today we’re going to talk about the clinical trial about Merck’s fraud in that process…and this is Merck’s claim:  The HPV vaccine will “eliminate cervical cancers and other HPV associated cancers.”  The danger of dying from HPV cancer in this country is 1 death in 43.5 thousand people.  Imagine you have a deck of cards but instead of 50 cards. There’s 43,500 on a on a big, big table and one of those cards is a black card. If you get that, you die.  So, Merck’s deal is that it’s going to remove that black card from the deck. But in order to play the game and make sure that Merck removes the black card, everybody who participates has to put in $420 because that’s the cost of the three-dose Gardasil vaccine.  So, here’s Gardasil by the numbers. So, the cost of the three-jab series average is about $420. There are 76 million children who essentially have been mandated by CDC to receive these vaccines. A blockbuster product from Merck, and global revenues from this vaccine today are about $2.3 billion dollars. It’s the third largest product in the company’s inventory.  The cost of saving one American life is 18.3 million dollars. People could argue whether or not that’s a reasonable value of a human life. What I would say was is that the criteria that we should use for evaluating reasonableness—is there a cheaper way to save more lives? And people would argue that Pap smears are the most effective way that 80 percent of cervical cancer deaths have already been eliminated by Pap smears. And this is the most effective technology.  Incidentally in another context HHS has already put a value on human life and the value is $250k. That is the maximum number that the vaccine compensation program will pay for killing an American citizen.  Prior to marketing the vaccine, the FDA licenses the vaccine, and in that licensing process Merck had to show that the vaccine was safe. According to Federal regulations the word “safety” means “relative freedom from harmful effects, taking into consideration the character of the product in relationship to the condition of the recipient at that time.”  So, what is the condition of the recipients of that target group for this vaccine. And this vaccine targets millions of preteens and teens, for whom the risk of dying from cervical cancer is practically zero. Cervical cancer’s median age of death is 58. It is first diagnosed at age 50 median.  A teenage girl or boy has zero chance of dying of this illness. Which means the threshold for giving this medication is very, very high.  Secondly it is mandated in some jurisdictions So the government is actually—government officials are actually—coming in and ordering people to take this medical intervention. So, we have to be sure that the threshold for risk, “the risk profile” for that medical intervention should be very, very low.  Third, unlike other medical interventions Gardasil recipients are perfectly healthy. So, when you give medication to a healthy individual you have to make sure that the risk profile is practically zero. And in order to determine risk, there is a standardized protocol. And it’s called double-blind placebo studies. What does that mean?  It means that the drug company that’s trying to license this product gives the medication to one group of people, maybe 5,000 or 10,000 people, and gives a placebo, an inert placebo, either an identical looking pill that is inert—it’s either saline or sugar—to a similarly situated group of 5,000 or 10,000 people and it’s double blind meaning that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who got the placebo and who got the actual medication.  And you can see here, here’s what the NIH says about the National Institute for Health placebos: an inactive substance that looks like a drug.  So here are typical examples:  Lipitor was given during its study phase to about 17k subjects. Half of them received Lipitor half of them received a sugar pill that looked identical to Lipitor and they were observed and studied for up to 3.3 years.  Why for so long? Because many of the injuries that are caused by medication are latent—they don’t show up for two or three or four or five years cancer for example may not show up for four or five years after the exposure. Autoimmune diseases and allergies and these kind of things take a long time to diagnose. Enbrel for that reason was delayed for 6.6 years and against a control group that received a saline injection.  Botox, there was a national emergency to get Botox to market so people could get their wrinkles cured, was studied for 51 weeks and it was studied against a saline injection.  Now I’m going to show you one of the really outrageous frauds that Merck committed during the clinical trials. This is an insert that is part of every vaccine package. And you can go on the Internet right now and look up that Merck product and search and find these two tables.  In the initial table you can see a there are three columns and this is a table that just looks at injuries at the vaccine site for redness and itching and bruising and pain at the vaccine site and they use one…there were 5,000 girls—5,088 girls who got the Gardasil vaccine.  Number two, there were 3,470 girls who got the AAHS control, what is that? That is the adjuvant in the vaccine. That is a toxic neurotoxin, that’s put in the vaccine to make it more long-lasting to provoke an immune response in the subject of the vaccine.  And most people believe that it is that aluminum adjuvant that is causing all of these injuries in the girls who are getting the vaccine. And there were 3,470 people who received just the neurotoxin with no antigens and no other vaccine components.  And you have a third group which is the placebo group. What I want you to look at is at these numbers. That in the Gardasil and AAHS control there is virtually the same number of injuries.  And when you get to the saline placebo, that injury rate is cut in half.  Now let’s go to the table where they talk about real systemic injuries…autoimmune diseases, and instead of showing us real science, which is to show us what happened to the saline group, they hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your pediatrician and the regulatory agency by compressing it into the aluminum group and they never tell us. They say this is a combination of the aluminum adjuvant and the saline placebo. They don’t tell us how many in each category were compressed there. The real thing that you need to watch here is what happened.  These are all very, very serious injuries. These are injuries that in some cases people would feel were worse than death—and that affect people and debilitate for a lifetime in many cases.  And if you look at the bottom of the Gardasil group an astonishing 2.3 percent of the girls in the clinical study who received the Gardasil vaccine got ill from autoimmune diseases, many within seven months of taking the vaccine.  And look what happened in the aluminum group—the same number exactly. 2.3 percent.  Nobody, no parent would allow their daughter to take a substance that had a one-in-40 chance of giving them a lifetime disability.  World Health Organization says that using a spiked placebo, or a faux-cebo as Merck did with Gardasil, puts you at a methodological disadvantage that “it may be difficult or impossible to assess vaccine safety.”  Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed the polio vaccine…who developed the pertussis vaccine, who developed the rotavirus vaccine—the Stanley Plotkin award is the Nobel Prize of vaccinology it’s given to the top vaccinologist every year—and what he says is:  Unless you have a true control group you are in LA LA LAND.  Finally, the American Medical Association says the absence of double-blind placebo testing and short-term studies of chronic disease are “the indicia of marketing masquerading as science.”  And that’s what Merck gave us.  The Cochrane Collaboration—thirty thousand scientists from all over the world who came together to create an independent assessment of medical protocols which they saw as being increasingly controlled by the industry—The Cochrane Collaboration said the use of active comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms and the comparative group thereby masking harms created by the HPV vaccine.  And that indeed was Merck’s point…to hide those harms.  So, if you do the math women are 100 times more likely to suffer serious adverse events from the Gardasil vaccine than they are to be protected from cervical cancer.  So now we have a very different bargain in this card game that we’re playing with Merck.  If 43 thousand cards and the black card—the death card is gone—but now, there are a thousand blue cards which if you pick one of those by mistake you have a good chance of getting an autoimmune disease. Nobody would take that bargain.  So, in order to get the FDA license to market this vaccine Merck did a number of studies, which are called protocols. We don’t know how many they did because they’re not telling us they never disclosed it.  The one we’re most concerned with is protocol 18. The reason protocol 18 is critical is because that was the basis for FDA giving Merck the license to produce and market the vaccine.  Why is that? Because protocol 18 is the only one in which the target audience for this vaccine. 11- and 12-year old girls was actually tested, and had a control group. The other ones looked at big cohorts of women were 16 to 25-year old and 16 to 26-year old women.  Protocol 18 looked at girls and boys from ages 9 to 15. It was a total of 1200 children. and almost 600 controls. That is a very, very, tiny group of people to study in order to determine the safety of a product is going to be marketed to billions of children around the world.  Now I’m going to show you one of the key fraudulent flimflams that Merck used to get this license. FDA said they approved Gardasil based on protocol 18 because protocol 18 was of particular interest because it’s the only protocol in which Merck used a true saline placebo instead of the aluminum adjuvant as a control.  That’s what Merck told FDA and the CDC but Merck was lying. It actually did not use a true saline placebo. It used what Merck called the “carrier solution.” Which is all of the components of the vaccine except for the aluminum and the viral particles the antigen.  Among the compounds that we know were in the carrier solution are Polysorbate 80 which we have no idea what the safety profile is because it’s never been tested for safety independently in vaccines. Sodium borate which is borax which is banned by FDA in food products and all food products in the United States, and is banned altogether in Europe, genetically modified yeast, there’s no safety test ever been done on it in vaccines L-histidine, the same, and possibly DNA fragments.  I say possibly because we know there are DNA fragments in the final vaccine, we don’t know how they got there. And Merck has lied about the DNA fragments from the outset.  And despite these potentially toxic components of compounds that are in the vaccine, the 596 children that were given the carrier solution fared much better in the other than any other cohort in the study. The girls and boys who receive the carrier solution were the only significant cohorts with no serious adverse events for the first 15 days.  And here’s another one of the gravamen of the fraud that Merck committed in its Gardasil trials, but it turns out in the protocol 18 study, it appears Merck cut the amount of aluminum that was given to the vaccine group in half. They tested a completely different formulation. If true, we theorize that they took the aluminum out to reduce the number of injuries and to mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine.  And since the protocol 18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial itself constitutes rank scientific fraud.  Here’s another bag of tricks that was used by Merck in order to skew the clinical trials results in favor of Gardasil.  Merck and its researchers use what they call exclusion criteria—for example people who had zero allergies, people who had prior genital infections were thrown out of the clinical trials. People who had over four sex partners in their entire lives were excluded from the trials. Anybody who had a history of immunological or nervous system disorders, people with chronic illnesses and seizure disorders, people with other medical conditions, people who had reactions to vaccine ingredients including the aluminum, yeast and the benzonase. or anybody with a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  If you really wanted to know whether the vaccine was helping people—if it was effective—wouldn’t you want those people in your study wouldn’t you want people who had a genetic vulnerability to cancer in your study to see if it actually was capable of preventing cancer.  Then Merck had one catch all exclusion category which was any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Well, that gave Merck and its paid investigators complete control to throw people out of the study who they thought might make the study look not successful. All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit the study to people who were like All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit this study to people who were like an elite club of superheroes…the people who get the vaccine are not the same people they tested on. They tested it on the Avengers. They didn’t test it on, you know, Joe Bag-of-Donuts … the people are actually receiving this vaccine in day to day life. And by doing that they were able to mask whatever injury might show up in a larger and more vulnerable population who are actually receiving the vaccine.  Experts used an arsenal of sloppy protocols to again, hide vaccine injuries. Among these, Merck gave report cards—the daily journal report cards— only to 10 percent of the people who they tested the vaccine on and told those people only make reports for 14 days after the injection. And the report cards were only designed to collect jab site information. So, redness, itching, bruising, fever.  And they ignored altogether the autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems and pain and dizziness and seizures and all of the other things that we’ve now seen are associated with the vaccine. In fact, there are numerous girls who report that they were injured that they attempted to report those injuries to Merck, and that Merck rebuffed them.  Furthermore, Merck gave extraordinary discretion to its researchers to determine what was a vaccine injury in what was not a vaccine injury and because there was no inert placebo, it was completely within their discretion. If a girl came back with seizures or autoimmune disease or menstrual cycle problems they could just say to the girl, well that’s not related to the vaccine.  In some cases, we know that Merck actively covered up and lied about injuries that it had a duty to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. For example, in the case of Christina Tarsell, a Maryland girl, who died from the Gardasil vaccine, Merck lied about that death in its official reports of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It told the system that Christina’s doctor had told Merck that her death was the result of a virus.  And the doctor adamantly denies that. Merck has refused to remove the misinformation from the VAERS system.  Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls who participated in these studies, telling them No.1, that the placebo was saline and that it contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe.  What did this do for Merck? It made it so the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine. Because they believed that the vaccine that they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries they did experience maybe a month or two months or three months after the vaccine must be simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine.  Despite all of these efforts by Merck to discourage those from reporting vaccine injuries during the clinical trials, half of the girls in the Gardasil group and half of them in the aluminum adjuvant group reported serious injuries after receiving the vaccine.  In order to conceal the link between these injuries and the vaccine, Merck invented a brand new medical metric that had never been heard of before called “new medical conditions” and it dismissed all of these new injuries which affected 50 percent of the girls who received the vaccine and the adjuvant as “new medical conditions”, unrelated to the vaccines, simply sad coincidences.  Many of these diseases were serious diseases—blood lymphatic diseases, anemia, endocrine diseases, autoimmune diseases, G.I., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, vaginal infections musculoskeletal injuries, arthritis, neoplasm, Hodgkin’s disease, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, depression, reproductive and breast disorders, menstrual irregularities, and pain. Over 3 percent of the girls—1 in 30—in both groups required surgical and medical procedures.  So, this card game that we’re playing with Merck has now become a really bad bet.  Merck has removed the one black card but you now have a 1 in 40 chance of drawing a blue card and getting an autoimmune disease that may afflict you for the rest of your life and you have a 1 in 2 chance of having some other serious medical condition.  So now let’s look at Merck’s central claim which is that the Gardasil vaccine will prevent cervical cancer.  Merck’s in a sweet position here, let’s face it because the target group vaccine is 11-year olds, and the median age of death for cervical cancer is age 58. Merck essentially is making this bargain.  It’s telling the 11-year old girl if you take our vaccine 47 years from now you won’t die of cervical cancer. And of course, that truth is you can’t make a vaccine that proves that it’s going to prevent cancer 47 years from now. There’s no way to test for that.  So, Merck used a shortcut. It said we’re going to prove that it prevents these what it called surrogate end points. The best thing that Merck had come up with was CIN2 and CIN3 lesions which it called precancerous lesions even though most of those lesions never mature into cancer.  So how can you call something precancerous when it was never going to turn into cancer?  And here’s what a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology said about Merck’s scheme: CIN3 is an imperfect diagnosis of precancer, and an intermediate surrogate for cancer.  Their own attorneys told them for these products, the indication is the surrogate, not the ultimate. Promotion cannot make any claim, vis-a-vis the ultimate end point, based upon the fate of a surrogate endpoint.  Merck has another problem. Recent peer reviewed scientific studies indicate that perhaps only a third of cervical cancer cases are even associated with the HPV vaccine. That would completely put the lie to Merck’s claims that Gardasil is going to eliminate cervical cancer altogether.  So now we have a really dubious deal because we need to put that black card back in the deck because now, we have doubts about whether or not this vaccine can prevent cervical cancer at all.  But the news gets worse. Gardasil may actually cause cancer. Gardasil’s insert states Gardasil has never been evaluated for potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. And Gardasil’s ingredients include possible carcinogens including human DNA.  And look at this…This is Merck’s own pre-clinical trial records and those records show that girls or women, who already had HPV—had been exposed at some point in their life to it—actually had a negative efficacy of 44.6 percent.  What is negative efficacy? It means those girls had a 44.6 increased risk of getting those precancerous lesions. To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomena of what is known as type replacement—some 200 different strands of HPV, some of them are more cancerous than others, and the current HPV vaccine goes after 9 of those 200 viral types. What these studies indicate is by eliminating those particular strains of the virus it opens up an ecological niche in the woman so that more lethal and virulent viruses can actually colonize that spot and dramatically increase the risk of cervical cancer.  So now Merck’s deal is looking really grim. Not only do we have a one-in-40 chance of getting an autoimmune disease and a 50 percent chance of getting some serious medical condition but now the cancer risk has been reinserted and actually amplified.  And now let’s look at some of the non-cancer injuries that Merck found in its preclinical studies.  The miscarriage rate in the preclinical studies after Gardasil doubled the background rate. The birth defects in the Gardasil group were five times the rate of birth defects from the control group. As to reproductive disorders an astonishing 10.9 percent of the women in the pool group reported reproductive disorders within seven months of receiving Gardasil compared to 1.2 percent in the placebo group. The death rate in the Gardasil group and the clinical trials was 8.5 per 10 thousand.  Death risk from this vaccine according to Merck’s own studies is 37 times the risk of dying from cervical cancer.  Oh, now look at the deal that Merck has offered us they’ve actually increased our risk of dying by 37 times.  So now let’s look at post-licensing surveillance. So, Merck can argue that we might have missed something in our pre-licensing studies but surely if there were any injuries being caused by this vaccine we would see them in post-licensing surveillance.  And the problem with that is that the post-licensing surveillance system, the principle one, is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The system is a voluntary system that simply does not work. It’s broken. In fact, in 2010 HHS hired another federal agency the agency for healthcare research quality and a group of Harvard researchers to study Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and those researchers found fewer than 1 percent of adverse events of vaccines are ever reported.  But even under that system, Gardasil has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented.  In fact, when you compare it to Menactra which is a meningitis vaccine that’s given to the same age group—teenagers—Gardasil had an 8.5 times more emergency room visits, 12.5 times more hospitalizations, 10 times more life-threatening events and 26.5 times more disabilities than Menactra.  The vaccine court which is within HHS has made awards for numerous deaths and very, very serious injuries from the Gardasil vaccine. So, HHS itself admits that this vaccine kills people and it’s given compensation to the families that were injured.  The same wave of serious injuries and deaths that have been seen in nations around the globe, when they adopt mandates for the Gardasil vaccine. Even Gardasil’s own insert, the package insert that the company provides, acknowledges that the injuries that can be caused by this vaccine include death, pancreatitis, fatigue, malaise, immune system disorders, autoimmune diseases, anaphylaxis, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, that’s brain injuries, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neuron diseases, paralysis, seizures, Transverse myelitis, and vascular disorders.  In Australia, in 2015, the Australian Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration reported that the adverse rates in girls is 17 times the incidental rate for cervical cancer throughout their lifespan. The country only looked at a handful of conditions including demyelinating disorders, complex regional pain syndrome and premature ovarian failure. There are many, many other injuries that included hospitalizations that were not subject to that study.  India suspended its Gardasil trials after numerous deaths and serious injuries.  A south Asian Journal of Cancer found that “a healthy 16-year old is at zero immediate risk of dying from cervical cancer but is faced with a small, but real risk of death or serious disability from a vaccine that has yet to prevent a single case of cervical cancer.”  Japan de-recommended Gardasil three months after it had added the vaccine to the immunization schedule. Japan’s health ministry discovered adverse events reported after Gardasil’s approval were many times higher than other vaccines on the recommended schedule—these included seizures severe headaches partial paralysis complex regional pain syndrome and an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination.  Japanese researchers found that the adverse event rate for the HPV vaccine was as high as nine percent and that pregnant women injected with the vaccine aborted or miscarried 30 percent of their babies.  In 2015 the Japanese Association for Medical Sciences issued official guidelines for managing symptoms of injuries caused by the Gardasil vaccine and the association announced there was no proof that this vaccine even prevents cervical cancer.  Alarmingly Merck’s own studies indicate that the Gardasil vaccine may disproportionately impact Asian women. For example, in protocol 19 there were 8 deaths among 3800 women and 7 those were Asians. That was 87 percent for Asian women, while only 31 percent of study participants were Asian.  Denmark in 2015 announced the opening of five new HPV clinics to treat women who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine. The day that they announced that opening there were 1300 applicants for treatment in those clinics.  In Colombia in 2014 800 girls in the town Carmen de Bolivar were grievously injured by Gardasil vaccine. Protests erupted all over Columbia. The attorney general of Colombia ordered the National Health Service of that country to immediately begin treating girls who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine and 2017 Colombia’s highest Constitutional Court ruled that the HPV vaccine would no longer be considered mandatory in Colombia and ordered that girls who showed symptoms after receiving the vaccine be given appropriate medical care.  Pompilio Martinez, who now teaches at the National University of Colombia, described the HPV vaccine as “a crime against humanity.”  Recent studies have shown that in nations with robust HPV vaccination programs and heavily vaccinated populations—in the UK and Sweden and Australia—were actually seeing dramatic upticks rises in the rate of cervical cancer rather than the downtrends that Merck promised everybody.  Now I’m going to show you some of the reasons why your pediatrician is insisting despite all of this evidence that your daughter or son gets the HPV vaccine. And the reason is the pediatrician is getting his information from agencies that have compromised through financial entanglements with Merck.  This is what the FDA is telling the public about vaccine safety: it says that vaccines are regulated by FDA and undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety efficacy and purity and potency of these products.  But this is a very different story the FDA is acknowledging in-house, and this comes from a 2007 document—this is the year that Gardasil got its license from the FDA, FDA’s inability to keep up with scientific advances mean that American lives are at risk. FDA is evaluations and methods have remained largely unchanged over the last half century. The world looks to FDA as a leader today. Not only can the agency not lead, it cannot even keep up with the advances in science.  But, the most troubling problem at FDA is it has nothing to do with incompetence. It has to do with corruption. The panel within FDA that licenses new vaccines and anoints them as safe is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the acronym is VRBPAC. And in 2000 Congress investigated VRBPAC because of charges of corruption from outside the agency.  And here’s what the congressional committee found: the overwhelming majority of members, both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Conflicts of interest rules employed by FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax. Committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies are given waivers to participate in committee proceedings. In many cases significant conflicts of interest are deemed to be in conflict at all.  And here are some specific examples of the conflict of the advisory committee that approves vaccines:  Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December of 1997 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.  One of the five voting members had a 9 plus million dollar contract for a rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop the rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members received approximately a million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development.  Once they get by FDA, vaccine companies then go to CDC, where another committee, which is called ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will then take that vaccine that FDA has licensed and they will put it on the recommended list which means it becomes essentially mandatory for 76 million American children.  A listing on CDC’s recommended list is the holy grail for vaccine companies. It ","RFK, Jr.: Gardasil “The Science” Video and Other Facts • Children's Health Defense",other

Another deadly attack in London. Britain’s prime minister condemns an evil ideology.  BEGIN VIDEOTAPE  WALLACE: We’ll get the latest in live reports from London and we’ll discuss what it means for the U.S. with Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Then, President Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord and starts a global debate.  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.  WALLACE: We’ll discuss the impact on the environment, the U.S. economy and America's place in the world with Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.  And critics attack President Trump for leaving the climate deal, pointing to long-lasting consequences.  EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: Make our planet great again.  REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., MINORITY LEADER: How was he ever going to explain to his grandchildren what he did to the air they breathe?  WALLACE: We’ll talk with one of the world's leading advocate on climate change, former Vice President Al Gore, who calls the president's withdrawal reckless and indefensible.  Pruitt and Al Gore, live, only on Fox News Sunday.  Plus, former FBI Director James Comey testifies before Congress this week about his conversations with Mr. Trump. We’ll ask our Sunday panel about what promises to be a moment of high drama.  All, right now, on Fox News Sunday.  END VIDEOTAPE  WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  We begin with breaking news out of London, at least seven are dead and dozens injured after another terror attack targeted Britain's capital. This comes less than two weeks after a suicide bomber hit a pop concert in Manchester, England.  In a few minutes, we’ll talk with Senator Roy Blunt, member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  But we begin with Fox team coverage, Catherine Herridge on what the intelligence community is saying. But, first, senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot live from our London bureau -- Greg.  GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, for the third time in three months, terror hits the U.K. and once again, it is ugly. It was on a busy Saturday night in London as the attackers spread across London Bridge in a rented van, driving up on the walkway, smashing into pedestrians. They then ditched that vehicle a few blocks away, and armed with long knives stabbed their way through bars and restaurants nearby, with some putting up a fight.  All told, at least seven people were killed, 48 injured, many critically, including an off-duty police officer. Along with British citizens from France, Australia and elsewhere were targeted. No word yet on whether any Americans were involved.  Now, police caught up with the attackers just eight minutes later, shooting that all three, at least one had a beard, camouflage pants and a fake suicide vest. When one attack he reportedly screamed out: Praise to Allah -- the Arabic word for God.  Here is what U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had to say today.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: As a country, our response must be what it has always been, when we have been confronted by violence. We must come together, we must pull together and united we will take on and defeat our enemies.  END VIDEO CLIP  PALKOT: Police now say they have arrested 12 people following raids in eastern London, said to be the home of one of the attackers. It is a sign that authorities might be on the trail of the terrorist. Police also doing a thorough forensic search of the entire terrorist site, but what is next?  Prime Minister Theresa May also said today terror breeds terror -- Chris.  WALLACE: Greg Palkot, reporting from London -- Greg, thanks for that.  Now, let's bring in chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with the latest on who was behind the attack -- Catherine.  CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Chris, no group is claiming responsibility this morning. But within minutes of the attack, a senior ISIS affiliated social media account pushed out slick propaganda on using vehicles as weapons, threatening more violence. It's not clear whether the ISIS posts were opportunistic or the terror group played a role. This morning, U.S. and U.K. intelligence are focused on the suspects and whether they acted alone or had a terror network behind them.  British security sources reporting that very early indications suggest the attack may have been pulled together at short notice. With the rising homegrown threat, British police are trained to quickly neutralize suspects as they did last night.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  CRESSIDA DICK, LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER: That vehicle continued to drive from London Bridge to the borough market. The suspects then left the vehicle and a number of people were stabbed. The suspects were shot dead by armed officers.  END VIDEO CLIP  HERRIDGE: Homeland Security is saying that at this time they have no information to indicate if specific credible threat to the United States. Secretary Kelly told Fox last night he worries we are, quote, right around the corner from having a similar attack but for the efforts of DHS and law enforcement agencies.  President Trump was briefed last night and spoke with the British prime minister, expressing his condolences and praising the heroic response of London police and first responders.  The president also seeming to make a political point that the attack bolstered his travel ban: We need to be smart, vigilant and tough, he tweeted. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban extra level of security -- safety.  Questions are being raised this morning about a possible intelligence failure after the British government recently lower the threat level, Chris.  WALLACE: Catherine, thank you.  HERRIDGE: You’re welcome.  WALLACE: Joining me now, Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Senator, welcome back.  SEN. ROY BLUNT, R-MISSOURI: Good to be with you.  WALLACE: What can you add to what we just heard from Catherine Herridge?  BLUNT: Well, you know, I think what we are seeing is such a broad band of potential attacks. We hear from our own intelligence community and have for years, more threats for more directions than ever before. You see the terrible Manchester bombing, those young people, mostly young women, young girls, with a fairly sophisticated bomb, based on published reports on that.  These guys have a van and kitchen knives. We think other groups are looking at more advanced kinds of attacks. So, clearly, this is from all directions, is tends to take credit for the things that you can steal a truck, get your van, drive in a car, terrorized people with very little planning or backup. Other groups we believe are looking at other things and we are constantly have to be vigilant, I think Secretary Kelly is right when he says that only because we have been fortunate and worked hard to prevent this have we not had these kinds of attacks here.  WALLACE: I want to play a clip from British Prime Minister May today. Here it is.  BGEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MAY: While the recent attacks are not connected by common networks, they are connected in one important sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Any explanation as to why we have seen three fatal terror attacks in Britain in less than three months?  BLUNT: I don't know if there's any real explanation for that, but in Paris and London and Western Europe, generally, it got people who came there to do jobs that were allowed to stay in enclaves, never became part of the society. You see the second generation of those families often turning to what the prime minister mentioned, you know, we need to say, we need to talk about it, our friends who are Muslim need to admit that this extreme sense of Islam that results in these attacks has to be called for what it is and we have to try to do what we can to intervene.  WALLACE: Do we have -- I’ve heard the argument that because we are beginning to roll back ISIS in the so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria, that there is an increased emphasis on these attacks, these kind of low technology attacks in the West. Do you think our success in one place is creating more of a threat?  BLUNT: I think you can. You know, somebody made the observation that long ago that sometimes countries implode. Syria seems to have exploded. That as things change in Syria, people have access to Europe in ways that you would otherwise want to try and do something about.  There's no way to do background checks on people that come in from communities that no longer exist, jobs that were jobs months or years ago. And so, I think we do see that. And, you know, like so many of the things that happened in Northern Africa, what people initially thought would be the result would turn out to be just the opposite.  WALLACE: As a member of the Senate Intelligence committee, any indication of an increased terror threat here in the U.S.?  BLUNT: I think the terror threat is real. You know, one of the things -- when we've seen things like San Bernardino, more often than not, U.S. officials, the FBI and others talk to these people, after months of surveillance decided they no longer needed to be under the level of watch they were and then suddenly these kinds of things happen.  I do think, again, that you've got some groups that are looking at a big play like taking down an airliner. You've got others who need very little support, very little planning, and can do incredible damage, which is actually in many ways almost more of terrorism because you go anywhere, do anything, you wonder what could happen at any moment. It could happen here --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: -- in London Bridge on a Saturday night.  BLUNT: London Bridge, the Westminster Bridge, the concert.  WALLACE: The concert, yes.  BLUNT: All of these things are true terror targets. They’re not -- it's not like going after the U.S. embassy.  WALLACE: Right.  BLUNT: They are true terror targets.  WALLACE: As Catherine mentioned just after the news broke about this terror attack, President Trump tweeted another call for his travel ban. That case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Do you think the justices should pay attention to the kind of thing that is happening in England and other parts of the world as they make that decision?  I mean, the fact is, in Britain, most of these terrorists have been homegrown. They've been U.K. citizens.  BLUNT: They have been. And, you know, looking at where people like that who come to our country have been is important. I’m not nearly as concerned as a lot of people are about the visa waiver program, because the visa waiver program just triggers that you can spend more time on people who you have reason to believe may have been in Libya, may have been in Syria, may have become radicalized.  I don’t know what the court will decide. I’m not a lawyer. I think my view is the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting. And, Christ, it’s been four -- it's been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place. I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.  WALLACE: I want to talk to you about another hat as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. A lot of anticipation about the testimony this week from FBI -- former FBI Director James Comey, what you expect to hear from him? What questions do you have for him?  BLUNT: Well, I think it's important that we talk to everybody who should be talk to about this. I do believe that the Senate Intelligence Committee is the most likely place to bring this investigation to conclusion with whatever the conclusion turns out to be. You know, we used to dealing with each other on issues like this, so we are used to classify documents, we’re used to coming together to protect the country. Hopefully, that's what we will be able to do --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: What are you looking to ask ph from Comey?  BLUNT: We -- what Comey says and how he says that I think will be important. I haven't frankly understood much of what Comey has done since about a year ago. And his decisions have been, I think, highly questionable. We’ll see what -- why he was prepared for that meeting the way he was, said he had a round of murder board kind of questions before he went to see the president, why he thought it was important to immediately download that, and what other meetings he had that frankly he didn't think were so important to download what happen.  WALLACE: Finally, do you think that President Trump has a legitimate claim to executive privilege to block Comey from testifying? And as a practical matter, do you think he should invoke it?  BLUNT: I think the president is better served by getting all this information out. Sooner rather than later, let's find out what happened and bring this to a conclusion. You don't do that I think by invoking executive privilege on a conversation you had apparently with nobody else in the room. You know, most stories have two sides to them. At some point, we’ll hear the president’s side. But I frankly think we need to hear Mr. Comey's side and find out what other questions we need to ask after he answers the questions this week.  WALLACE: Senator Blunt, thank you. Thanks for your time this Sunday. And thank you for coming in on short notice.  BLUNT: Glad to be here.  WALLACE: Up next, President Trump's dramatic decision this week to pull out of the Paris climate accord. We’ll talk with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a key player in the president's deliberations.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Pittsburgh. The president said he's looking out for residents of the former steel town in pulling out of the Paris climate deal.  International leaders, business executives and people around the world are still reacting to President Trump's decision this week. In a few minutes, we’ll talk with former Vice President Al Gore, a leading advocate on climate change.  Joining me now is Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump's administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency and a key player in the president's decision.  Mr. Pruitt, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.  SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: Good morning, Chris.  WALLACE: I want to start with a question that you were asked repeatedly on Friday. Here it is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS: Yes or no, does the president believe that the climate change is real and a threat to the United States?  PHILIP RUCKER, WASHINGTON POST: Does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax?  PRUITT: What's interesting about all the discussions we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue: is Paris good or not for this country?  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Let me get this straight, you and the president spent weeks discussing whether he should pull out of the Paris climate deal and you never discussed climate change?  PRUITT: It was about the merits and demerits of the deal, Chris.  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: That’s what the focus.  Look, when you look at what this country has achieved since the late 1990s-2000 time frame, we've seen an 18 percent reduction in CO2 footprint from 2000 to 2014. We’re at pre-1994 levels.  You know, what's interesting about all this criticism from the left, environment left, is if you go back to the time when the Paris deal was cut, those same groups -- in fact, James Hansen, former national scientist, called it a fake and a fraud. The general counsel of the Sierra Club was critical of what was achieved in Paris because it didn't hold China, it did not hold India accountable, and the United States agreed to 26 percent to 28 percent reductions, in CHD ph.  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: We’re going to get into all of that, but what I’m asking you is, as the president’s EPA administrator, as his point person on the environment, isn’t that a conversation that over the last few months that you have to have, whether or not climate change is real or a hoax, as the president suggested, and whether or not human activity contributes to it? Are you saying you've never had that conversation with him?  PRUITT: The focus of the last several weeks was centered --  WALLACE: I’m asking you over the last few months --  PRUITT: -- was centered on the merits and demerits of the Paris agreement. The president said -- said actually back during the campaign, that climate change occurs. I’ve said -- I’ve said during my confirmation process that climate change is occurring. That human activity contributes to it.  WALLACE: He also said it was a hoax.  PRUITT: Well, Chris, the point here, and to your question, this is something over the last several weeks, the president has received much information about the impact on jobs and also the impact on the environment. You know, we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country with respect to what we've done in reducing our CO2 footprint. It’s also --  WALLACE: I don’t want to be a --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: -- but you’re not going to tell me whether or not the president believes climate change is a hoax and whether or not human activity -- it's a simple question.  PRUITT: The president has indicated that the climate changes. It's always changing. I’ve indicated the same.  WALLACE: Well, that’s the same --  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: What's important, Chris, here -- what’s important is what the president did on Thursday is put America first and say to the United States and say to the world that we’re going to remain engaged, but we’re also going to make sure that as we remain engage, we put America’s interest first.  WALLACE: As you pointed out, the president justified pulling out of the Paris deal largely on economic terms. Here he is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: The American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But the study that the president cited was funded by two groups that are dramatically opposed to environmental regulation and the study itself acknowledges it does -- this is a quote from the study -- it does not take into account the potential benefits from avoided emissions. The study results are not a benefit-cost analysis of climate change.  PRUITT: Well, there were several --  WALLACE: Administrator, it is a worst-case scenario.  PRUITT: There were several studies that were actually published in response to Paris. NERA, the Heritage study, the Global Policy publication --  WALLACE: You specifically quoted NERA.  PRUITT: There were several and -- that were sourced aspects as part of the speech.  And what we know from the Paris agreement objectively is that it was a $2.5 trillion contraction to our economy over ten years. What we do know is it impacted up to 400,000 jobs in this country. What we do know is it impacted both the manufacturing base and energy sector jobs.  You know, since last -- the fourth quarter of 2016, Chris, we've had almost 50,000 jobs created in the mining and coal sector alone. In fact, in the month of May, almost 7,000 jobs.  So, these individuals that are -- I think what’s also being missed here is that when you look at how we generate electricity in this country, the power grid. We need to feel diversity. We need coal, natural gas, hydro, renewables, nuclear, as part of that mix, because it provides stability and strength to our grid and lower cost. Our price per kilowatt compared to Germany, our price per kilowatt compared to Europe is far better and it helps us grow jobs in this country.  WALLACE: Mr. Pruitt, aren’t you focusing on the wrong thing?  I want to put up some, I’m going to say, surprising statistics. Take a look at this -- the U.S. now employs more than double the number of people in the solar industry than it does in coal. Aren’t you and the president talking about protecting the horse and buggy business just as cars come online?  PRUITT: Absolutely not, because as I just indicated, we need hydro -- we need hydrocarbon stored on-site at utility companies across this country to address something, attacks on our grid, attacks on infrastructure, if we have peaked demand needs, you want a diversity of fuels that generate electricity. It is bad business -- it is bad business for a country to limit the --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: President Trump talks about protecting the people of Pittsburgh. The mayor of Pittsburgh said we’re not a steel town anymore, we’re a green town and, in fact, he rejected what the president said. And the mayor of Pittsburgh, the city he specifically cited, said, we’re going to comply with the Paris climate accord.  PRUITT: This president has said that we truly need an all-of-the-above approach. We should not penalize sectors of our economy, Chris. Government regulation shouldn't be used to pick winners and losers. The past administration declared a war on coal and there were several coal facilities across the country shut down because of their past efforts. That is not what government regulation should be about.  Government regulation should be about making things regular, not picking winners and losers, and making sure we have fuel diversity and generating electricity in this country. And as I indicated, the jobs numbers show already, already, that this president's deregulatory agenda, his leadership in the energy space is making a difference for jobs across this country, almost 50,000 in the coal sector --  WALLACE: I want to go to another issue, because the president also said that the Paris climate accord and pulling out of it isn't going to make all that much difference on the environment. Here he is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: With total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that, this much.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But the people behind the MIT study, that study that he just cited say that he took a number from 2014 before the targets for the Paris accord were even reached. And the cofounder of the program said this about the White House: They found a number that made the point they want to make. It’s kind of a debate trick.  The people behind the study the president cited say, look, Paris isn’t going to solve everything. It isn’t going to solve global warming, but it makes an important contribution.  PRUITT: What short memories these folks have. What short memories they have.  James Hansen, former NASA scientist, the father of climate change, he's been called, called Paris a fake and a fraud, because of the very things the president cited. Two-tenths of one -- there are other studies. The Global Policy publication came out criticizing --  WALLACE: Are you going to speak to what the MIT authors --  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: Look, it’s very fishy to me that MIT updated their study or their results after we started citing it. No one is questioning their methodology. Nobody’s questioning their findings.  WALLACE: Well, in fact, you didn’t cite their study after Paris. You cited their study before Paris, in 2014.  PRUITT: What's interesting, Chris, is during the time before Paris, before Paris, this country reduce their CO2 footprint by over 18 percent, from 2000 to 2014. What does that demonstrate? It demonstrates that American innovation, American technology is leading the way with respect to reducing the CO2 footprint, not government mandate.  If China and India want to reduce their CO2 footprint, they should learn from us.  WALLACE: Well --  PRUITT: India, by the way, in the Paris agreement, talk about the merits of the deal, Chris, conditioned any steps that they would take on receiving $2.5 trillion of aid. China agreed to make no steps until the year 2030. They’re the largest polluters in the world.  WALLACE: Let me -- let me pick up on that because you've taken me exactly where I want to go.  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: Yes, this is working together.  The president had one more big complaint about Paris and he said that it treats the U.S. unfairly.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But here again, sir, the reality is different, is very different from what the president said. China has canceled plans for more than 100 coal plants and promises 20 percent of its energy consumption will be green by 2030. India has pledged 40 percent of its energy will be renewable by 2030. And it’s set to pass Japan this year as the world's third-largest market for solar power.  So, it may not mandate it in the Paris agreement, but, in fact, China and India are going green already.  PRUITT: You know, what’s interesting -- one of the keywords that was up on the screen was plans. China was actually building over 360 new coal generation facilities and had 800 planned, Chris. So, maybe they've drawn back on the number that are planned, but they’re burning coal. And they’re going to continue to burn coal.  WALLACE: Well, we are burning coal.  PRUITT: Just for foreseeable future.  We’ve got a contraction with respect to our grid, quite substantially. We used to be well above 40 percent. We’re now down around 30 percent, if not less.  So, this country has frontloaded its costs. The rest of the world said, hey, we’ll get to that later. They applauded when -- when we joined Paris, the rest of the world applauded, not because of climate reductions, but because it put this country at an economic disadvantage. We -- the Clean Power Plan alone, the Clean Power Plan alone represented almost $300 million of compliance cost to our economy.  So, why wouldn’t Paris -- excuse me, why wouldn’t France and these other countries want us to stay in that kind of deal? It's a bad deal for this country. The president didn't say, by the way, that we weren’t going to continue engagement. The president -- he said Paris represents a bad deal for this country.  WALLACE: He also said we’re going to renegotiate and all of the leaders around the world, certainly in Europe, said: forget it.  PRUITT: Well, then, he also said, either a new deal or as part of the Paris agreement.  But we’re already part -- look, we are the United States, Chris. We don't lose our seat at the table. We joined the treaty in 1992, called the UNFCCC, with respect to climate change.  WALLACE: All right.  PRUITT: And that is still there. We’re going to remain engaged internationally, but we’re going to make sure that as we make deals, that we put the interest of America first. This was applauded by small business.  You know, it was interesting. The New York Times yesterday had an article that a small business that applauded --  WALLACE: I don't want you to filibuster so we can't get to Al Gore. We want to get to him.  PRUITT: OK.  WALLACE: You brought up a lot of legitimate points I’m going to ask him about.  Mr. Pruitt, thank you for your time. Always good to talk with you.  PRUITT: Thank you.  WALLACE: And thank you for answering our questions.  PRUITT: Thanks, Chris.  WALLACE: That's what it's all about.  Up next, former Vice President Al Gore on Mr. Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before Congress this week about his conversations with the president.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: I hope this hearing doesn't become a hitch on President Trump. There's a cloud over the presidency that needs to be removed.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel what to expect.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: Former Vice President Al Gore's breakthrough documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, brought the topic of climate change to the forefront. Not surprisingly, he is one of the sharpest critics of Mr. Trump's decision this week. We welcome him for what we believe is his first appearance on Fox News since the 2000 campaign.  Mr. Vice President, good to have you back.  AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Great to be back, Chris. Thank you for inviting me.  WALLACE: Before we get to climate change, I want to ask you about this terrible attack in London. How do we stop these attacks on the west and is President Trump's travel been part of the answer?  GORE: Well, most of the attacks, both in England and here in the United States, have been by homegrown terrorists. And, of course, the courts will deal with the travel ban. They've already been struck down. We’ll see what the Supreme Court does.  This surge of terrorism, we -- we have to defeat it, but we have to defeat it not only with the force of arms, but with the force of our values. And I truly believe that giving people around the world a sense that the world’s got our act together and we’re going to move forward to a bright future is one of the important tasks at hand.  WALLACE: Let's turn to the subject at hand.  You met with President-elect Trump during the transition to discuss climate change and afterwards you said this.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GORE: I had a -- a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: You also talked with Mr. Trump, we’re told, last month about staying in the Paris climate deal. Did you misjudge the president?  GORE: Well, I've kept my communications with him confidential. I think that's the right way to handle it. But none of it would surprise you. I did my best to persuade him it was in our country's best interest to stay in the Paris agreement. I -- I thought there was a chance that he would do that. I'm sorry that he made the other decision.  WALLACE: How do you explain it?  GORE: Well, you’d have to ask him for the explanation. It makes no sense to me. I think that it was a reckless decision, and indefensible decision. I think it undermines our nations standing in the world and isolates us and threatens to harm humanity's ability to solve this crisis in time.  But, make no mistake about it, the -- this country is going to continue to solve the climate crisis. Governors like Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo, Jay Inslee, many others, mayors, Mike Bloomberg’s doing a great job rallying mayors around the country. We are going to continue reducing emissions. Atlanta just decided to go 100 percent renewable and there are many, many others.  WALLACE: Let’s talk -- and I -- you heard me challenge Scott Pruitt. I’m going to challenge you. Let's talk about some of the concerns that people have about Paris. President Trump talked about one.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: It includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called green climate fund, nice name.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Under the Paris Accord, 37 developed countries agreed to provide $100 billion to developing countries. Why is that fair?  GORE: Well, you know, when the Marshall Plan was launched by the United States after World War II, it ended up benefiting us tremendously, as well as making the world a better place. We would have been -- we would be 11th on the list of nations per capita in -- in helping the country to meet this climate challenge. And, by the way, one of the opportunities for us is to export our products and create more jobs here. You showed some jobs in the solar industry earlier. Solar jobs are now growing 17 times faster than other jobs. It's the brightest spot. If we get out there in the economy, if we get out there and help lead the sustainability revolution, it benefits our economy.  WALLACE: But here's the thing -- problem I think a lot of people have. Countries like the U.S., which have been developing an industrial economy since the 19th century, the argument is that somehow we owe something to countries that didn't.  GORE: Well, it’s a global challenge in the world community as a whole has to -- has to face up to it. This administration has said there's no such thing as a global community. Actually, there is, because we, as a civilization, are putting 110 million tons of heat trapping global warming pollution up into the sky every day as if it's an open sewer.  And, you know, the climate crisis is real, Chris. I -- I’m -- I'm sure you know that.

289d959a,"By Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Jostein Solheim, CEO of Ben & Jerry’s  Employers can often be hesitant to hire someone with a criminal conviction. Unsubstantiated rumors of increased violence in the workplace, theft, or incompetence often stand in the way of giving someone with a record a chance. Yet employers that do hire formerly incarcerated individuals end up reaping the benefits: loyal employees with higher retention rates, tax benefits, and increased economic mobility for their staff.  70 million Americans have a criminal record—that’s 1 in 3 adults. There are currently 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, 95 percent of whom will reenter our communities. 640,000 people are released from prison each year, creating a huge untapped workforce available to fill jobs. Yet, in New York State, 53 percent of people on parole have yet to find a job. Employers are often uncomfortable hiring people who have been convicted of a crime—one study found that, in New York City, a criminal record reduced the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent.  This is a problem. Joblessness is the number one predictor of recidivism—the less likely it is for a formerly incarcerated person to find a job, the more likely it is that they end up back in prison, with all the costs associated with incarceration, including a price tag of $60,000 per inmate per year in New York. These barriers to reentry have a negative trickle effect not only on the lives of these individuals, preventing them from providing for themselves and their families, but on society as a whole. Studies have shown that excluding formerly incarcerated individuals from the workforce results in a GDP loss of $78-87 billion thanks to lost tax revenue, and that if states can reduce recidivism rates by just 10 percent, they could save an average of $635 million annually.  That’s why my administration has launched the Work for Success Pledge—an online pledge in which companies, like Ben and Jerry’s or VICE Media, whose VICE Apprenticeship Program hires and trains formerly incarcerated people for production, editorial and creative jobs at the company, commit to consider hiring qualified candidates with criminal convictions. New York is the first state in the nation to develop such a pledge. So far, 80 companies have signed on and shown their commitment to hiring those with a criminal conviction—but we need more to pledge their support! It just makes good business sense.  Companies like Ben & Jerry’s recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business, our culture, and our bottom line. Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees—they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record, saving companies costs associated with hiring and training, which can be as much as $4,000 per employee. Additionally, companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit WOTC, which provides a maximum tax credit of $2,400 per employee.  Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work. A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history, a testament to their dedication and motivation.  Ben & Jerry’s is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers. It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which, through its open hiring process, has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity. It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we’ve made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications, not the mistakes of the past. There is no doubt, with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime, if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting, we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process. That’s just a bad business decision.  Across New York, the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions. In 2012, we launched the Work for Success Program, which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings. In the last five years, we have placed more than 18,000 people in jobs, and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program.  In 2015, the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting “fair chance hiring” for New York State agencies, meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant’s criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her. As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016, New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions.  These are small steps that can make a huge difference. Together, by signing the Work for Success Pledge, businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities, but to also improve our bottom line. New York State is dedicated to creating a true “state of opportunity” for everyone.",Employers are often unwilling to hire someone convicted of a crime. That's a problem — and it needs to change.,partially false
74604cc9,"There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.  These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.  This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here . In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.  Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.  A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.  Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.  The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking.  On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented 2.3 per cent.  This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients , of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.  Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for.","Smoke fags, save lives",other
46c63178,"Israeli research has found that just 0.04 per cent of those vaccinated with both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine went on to develop coronavirus  Almost all cases of Covid are prevented with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, research suggests.  Data gathered in Israel – which is leading the world in the vaccine rollout – found that just 0.04 per cent of those vaccinated with both doses went on to develop coronavirus.  Of 700,000 people who were vaccinated, just 300 later contracted the virus, with only 16 requiring hospital treatment, according to preliminary data released by Israeli health officials.  The vaccine also protects against the more infectious UK variant of Covid-19, the research suggests.  Professor Eyal Leshem, an Israeli infectious diseases specialist, said the reports were 'very good news'. He added: 'The initial findings are quite incredible.  Almost all cases of Covid are prevented with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, research suggests. Data gathered in Israel – which is leading the world in the vaccine rollout – found that just 0.04 per cent of those vaccinated with both doses went on to develop coronavirus.

'Time will tell, we still need to accumulate data but these are very encouraging preliminary reports.'  More than 30 per cent of Israel's population has received a vaccine, with several studies into its effectiveness under way.  Professor Leshem added: 'On one hand, we're seeing very high community transmission rates with 1,000s of cases every day - the highest rates we've experienced since the beginning of the outbreak.  'But when we look specifically at these hundreds of thousands of Israelis that are vaccinated, they don't get infected.

'It's what we call real life, ecologic evidence of vaccine efficacy - the high efficacy of the vaccine.'  The majority of those vaccinated were over 60, making the results even more remarkable, he added.  Initial studies have also found a significant reduction in cases among those who have had one dose of the vaccine.

074f1245,"After his unsuccessful run for President against Barack Obama, Mitt Romney hasn’t exactly acted like the Republican’s Republican. He’s voted against several pieces of GOP legislation while representing the state of Utah in the Senate, and he was the only voice of the conservative right to correctly recommend that Donald Trump be charged and prosecuted for crimes during his historic impeachment trial. Now, however, his seemingly turncoat antics may have gone too far. Like someone giving Melania Trump an American Express Gold Card at the Bunny Ranch.  Just this morning, at the Brigham Young pagoda of Utah’s Sandy Batt Fellowship Hall, the Informin’ Mormon told a gathered press corps that he would be endorsing candidate Joe Biden for the 2020 Presidential election over incumbent and fellow Republican Donald Trump. His ten minute long speech excoriated the beleaguered pandemic-botching fumbletwat and left supporters cold:  “I cannot, in good faith, and with hands raised to Heavenly Father, throw any manner of assistance towards the President and risk having four more years of his ineptitude and sheer criminality screwing over our country.

I intend to contribute my, and my State’s efforts to the rising Joementum movement in order to save America from a severely mentally handicapped evil gorilla and his pea-brained followers.

d2d3b970,"Some schools rated outstanding may no longer be as good as their rating suggests, Ofsted has said amid official criticism of its work in England.  A National Audit Office report found 1,620 schools, mostly outstanding, had not been inspected for six years or more, and 290 for a decade or more.  Outstanding schools were decreed exempt from routine inspections in 2011.  Ofsted bosses said there was no way of telling if these schools had since fallen into a mediocre category.  Although, inspections can be triggered at any school if a safeguarding concern is raised, or if there is a significant drop in results.  It no longer goes into these top-rated schools on a regular basis. 'Effectiveness reduced'  Ofsted's director of corporate strategy, Luke Tryl, said: What we can't tell is if the levels of education in those schools judged outstanding 10 years ago are the same or whether it has changed to become middling, or mediocre or coasting.  When asked by reporters if he was saying that some outstanding schools aren't really outstanding, he replied: Yes.  However, many schools will have their outstanding label highlighted on their websites and on banners outside their premises.  And many parents base at least their initial views of such schools on these Ofsted rankings. data pic  The NAO found the inspectorate's effectiveness has reduced as a result of the decision by the Department for Education and Ofsted to end routine inspections for outstanding and good schools.  Ofsted said it had since been lobbying the DfE to reinstate routine inspections every six years for a primary schools and every five or seven years for a secondary.  Schools minister Nick Gibb said: If Ofsted has reason to believe a school is no longer meeting its previous high standards, we would expect it to use its powers to carry out a full inspection - this has always been the case - and remains so.  He added that the inspectorate was given £40m a year to provide a school inspection regime that is focused on the schools that need the most improvement. Lack of inspectors  Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said most parents were savvy enough to look at a range of evidence on school effectiveness and did not just rely on Ofsted rankings.  His organisation has also been arguing for inspections of outstanding schools to be reinstated, calling for one every five years or so. Pupils in science classimage copyrightGetty Images  The schools inspectorate was also found to have missed its own targets on the re-inspection of the weakest schools - those rated inadequate.  The target of 24 months for such a re-inspection had been missed in 6% of cases, 78 schools, between 2012 and 2016, the NAO said.  These schools would have weak teaching, weak leadership and possibly some behaviour issues, Ofsted said.  The NAO report said: Ofsted has extended some of the targets to allow schools more time to improve.  This has also allowed Ofsted to spread re-inspections over a longer period.  But Ofsted told the NAO it had found it difficult to meet its inspection targets because of cuts to its budget and because it did not have enough inspectors.  In 2015, it took a decision to bring all its inspectors in house after a string of complaints about inspections that had been contracted out to private companies.  This had left it with a shortfall of inspectors, although this had improved in 2016-17, the NAO said. 'Cuts and shifts'  Matthew Coffey, Ofsted's chief operations officer, defended the decision to effectively reduce the number of inspectors, saying it was taken on quality grounds.  But he added that some of its most senior inspectors, HMIs her majesty's inspectors, had left to run some of the numerous multi-academy trust chains being formed at the time.  He said: Becoming an HMI used to be a traditional end of career role, and it's not like that any more.  It was a challenge, he said, to compete with academy trusts able to pay salaries of £100,000 or more.  HMIs were paid about £70,000, he said.  Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: The fact that Ofsted has been subject to constant cuts over more than a decade, and regular shifts in focus, speaks volumes.  It indicates a lack of clarity about how best to obtain assurance about the quality of schools.  The department needs to be mindful that cheaper inspection is not necessarily better inspection.  To demonstrate its commitment, the department needs a clear vision for school inspection and to resource it accordingly.  Nick Brook, NAHT deputy general secretary, said it was essential to hold schools to account, but the current system was muddled.  Schools and parents alike will be concerned to read that the NAO has concluded that the level of independent assurance about schools' effectiveness has reduced. Confidence in the quality and reliability of inspection is of paramount importance to all.  ",Ofsted admits some 'outstanding schools aren't that good',TRUE
1ea1d474,"Parents in England who refuse to pay a penalty after their children play truant will have their child benefit docked, the prime minister has said.  A civil penalty of up to £120 would be claimed through child benefit if the fine is not paid after 28 days. Currently, just over half of fines are paid in that period.  David Cameron told BBC Breakfast it was about making sure children get the great start in life that they need.  Teaching unions said docking child benefit could end up hurting children.  Follow live coverage of the Conservative Party conference  The existing system sees non-payment of the £60 civil penalty in England being doubled to £120 after 21 days, and subject to prosecution after 28 days. But many parents do not end up in court because councils do not take legal action.  David Cameron said the system must be changed because truancy was harmful to children's life chances.  All the evidence is that if children consistently miss school, they get a worse education, they get worse results and as a result they have less good prospects for the rest of their lives, he told BBC Breakfast.  So this is about making sure our children get the great future and the great start in life that they need. A police officer talking to a youthimage copyrightMet Police  At the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, he is expected to say: There is nothing responsible about allowing your child to go without an education.  So for parents who let their child play truant and refuse to pay truancy penalties, we will deduct it from their child benefit. Care requests  The Press Association says it obtained figures earlier this year which showed 16,430 people in England were prosecuted last year for failing to ensure that a child went to school.  About three-quarters - 12,479 - of these were found guilty, and courts issued 9,214 parents with fines worth an average of £172.  Mr Cameron first spoke of the idea of cutting benefits for parents of regular truants in September 2011.  And a key government adviser on school behaviour called for the same measure in April 2012.  But Chris Keates, general secretary of the teachers union NASUWT, said docking benefits was not the answer.  For some families all that this will do, of course, is increase the chaos and it will increase the deprivation, she said.  It won't actually solve the problem and in the middle of all of this is a child who's not getting their entitlement to education...  Meanwhile, the prime minister will also announce a new right for parents in England to request that schools provide breakfast and after-school clubs or holiday care.

5331f61c,"Joe Arpaio, former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, has died at the age of 89. Best known for being sued for various violations of the Constitution, not investigating sexual crimes against children, buying a tank, ignoring court orders, being incoherent at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and spying on a Federal judge’s wife, the former Sheriff was seeking to be back in the public eye.  The former sheriff was focused on being re-elected, believing the voters of the county to be gullible fools who missed him. Since Arizona voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he definitely had a chance.  Arpaio reportedly collapsed when he tried to chase a brown person out of his neighborhood in the Maryvale district of Phoenix.  County coroner Joe Barron performed the autopsy and spoke with our own Glenn Stanley,  “We were floored. We were thinking heart attack. We couldn’t find a heart, nor any evidence that there ever was a heart in Arpaio’s body.  It turns out that the actual cause of death was due to a lack of anyone paying attention to him. After he was pardoned by Trump for investigating a judge, he had a laughable run for Senate.  After everyone was done laughing at him, he faded into fatal obscurity.”  The burial of the Sheriff is expected to be attended by 3 or 4 people, including David Duke and Pamela Geller, who are afraid of the same things that Arpaio also hated.  President Trump reached out with a note to Joe Arpaio to get well but then retracted saying, “I like former sheriffs that didn’t die.”","Joe Arpaio, America’s Toughest Sheriff, Dead at 89",FALSE
e01f532a,"Rosemary Frei and Patrick Corbett  A high-profile European pathologist is reporting that he and his colleagues across Europe have not found any evidence of any deaths from the novel coronavirus on that continent.  Dr. Stoian Alexov called the World Health Organization WHO a “criminal medical organization” for creating worldwide fear and chaos without providing objectively verifiable proof of a pandemic.  Another stunning revelation from Bulgarian Pathology Association BPA president Dr. Alexov is that he believes it’s currently “impossible” to create a vaccine against the virus.  He also revealed that European pathologists haven’t identified any antibodies that are specific for SARS-CoV-2.  These stunning statements raise major questions, including about officials’ and scientists’ claims regarding the many vaccines they’re rushing into clinical trials around the world.  They also raise doubt about the veracity of claims of discovery of anti-novel-coronavirus antibodies which are beginning to be used to treat patients.  Novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies are supposedly the basis for the expensive serology test kits being used in many countries some of which have been found to be unacceptably inaccurate.  And they’re purportedly key to the immunity certificates coveted by Bill Gates that are about to go into widespread use — in the form of the COVI-PASS — in 15 countries including the UK, US, and Canada.  Dr. Alexov made his jaw-dropping observations in a video interview summarizing the consensus of participants in a May 8, 2020, European Society of Pathology ESP webinar on COVID-19.  The May 13 video interview of Dr. Alexov was conducted by Dr. Stoycho Katsarov, chair of the Center for Protection of Citizens’ Rights in Sofia and a former Bulgarian deputy minister of health. The video is on the BPA’s website, which also highlights some of Dr. Alexov’s main points.  We asked a native Bulgarian speaker with a science background to orally translate the video interview into English. We then transcribed her translation. The video is here and our English transcript is here.  Among the major bombshells Dr. Alexov dropped is that the leaders of the May 8 ESP webinar said no novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies have been found.  The body forms antibodies specific to pathogens it encounters. These specific antibodies are known as monoclonal antibodies and are a key tool in pathology. This is done via immunohistochemistry, which involves tagging antibodies with colours and then coating the biopsy- or autopsy-tissue slides with them. After giving the antibodies time to bind to the pathogens they’re specific for, the pathologists can look at the slides under a microscope and see the specific places where the coloured antibodies — and therefore the pathogens they’re bound to – are located.  Therefore, in the absence of monoclonal antibodies to the novel coronavirus, pathologists cannot verify whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the body, or whether the diseases and deaths attributed to it indeed were caused by the virus rather than by something else.  It would be easy to dismiss Dr. Alexov as just another crank ‘conspiracy theorist.’ After all many people believe they’re everywhere these days, spreading dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 and other issues.  In addition, little of what Dr. Alexov alleges was the consensus from the May 8 webinar is in the publicly viewable parts of the proceedings.  But keep in mind that whistleblowers often stand alone because the vast majority of people are afraid to speak out publicly.  Also, Dr. Alexov has an unimpugnable record and reputation. He’s been a physician for 30 years. He’s president of the BPA, a member of the ESP’s Advisory Board and head of the histopathology department at the Oncology Hospital in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.  On top of that, there’s other support for what Dr. Alexov is saying.  For example, the director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany said in media interviews that there’s a striking dearth of solid evidence for COVID-19’s lethality.  “COVID-19 is a fatal disease only in exceptional cases, but in most cases it is a predominantly harmless viral infection,” Dr. Klaus Püschel told a German paper in April. Adding in another interview:  In quite a few cases, we have also found that the current corona infection has nothing whatsoever to do with the fatal outcome because other causes of death are present, for example, a brain hemorrhage or a heart attack […] [COVID-19 is] not particularly dangerous viral disease […] All speculation about individual deaths that have not been expertly examined only fuel anxiety.”  Also, one of us Rosemary and another journalist, Amory Devereux, documented in a June 9 Off-Guardian article that the novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch’s postulates.  These postulates are scientific steps used to prove whether a virus exists and has a one-to-one relationship with a specific disease. We showed that to date no one has proven SARS-CoV-2 causes a discrete illness matching the characteristics of all the people who ostensibly died from COVID-19. Nor has the virus has been isolated, reproduced and then shown to cause this discrete illness.  In addition, in a June 27 Off-Guardian article two more journalists, Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter, added to the evidence that “the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.”  The pair also confirmed “there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences [deemed to match that of the novel coronavirus] are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.”  Dr. Alexov stated in the May 13 interview that:  the main conclusion [of those of us who participated in the May 8 webinar] was that the autopsies that were conducted in Germany, Italy, Spain, France and Sweden do not show that the virus is deadly.”  He added that:  What all of the pathologists said is that there’s no one who has died from the coronavirus. I will repeat that: no one has died from the coronavirus.”  Dr. Alexov also observed there is no proof from autopsies that anyone deemed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus died only from an inflammatory reaction sparked by the virus presenting as interstitial pneumonia rather than from other potentially fatal diseases.  Another revelation of his is that:  “We need to see exactly how the law will deal with immunization and that vaccine that we’re all talking about, because I’m certain it’s [currently] not possible to create a vaccine against COVID. I’m not sure what exactly Bill Gates is doing with his laboratories – is it really a vaccine he’s producing, or something else?”  As pointed to above, the inability to identify monoclonal antibodies for the virus suggests there is no basis for the vaccines, serological testing and immunity certificates being rolled out around the globe at unprecedented speed and cost. In fact, there is no solid evidence the virus exists.  Dr. Alexov made still more important points. For example, he noted that, in contrast to the seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 hasn’t been proven to kill youth:  [With the flu] we can find one virus which can cause a young person to die with no other illness present […] In other words, the coronavirus infection is an infection that does not lead to death. And the flu can lead to death.”  There have been reports of severe maladies such as Kawasaki-like disease and stroke in young people who were deemed to have a novel-coronavirus infection. However, the majority of published papers on these cases are very short and include only one or only a small handful of patients. Moreover, commenters on the papers note it’s impossible to determine the role of the virus because the papers’ authors did not control sufficiently, if at all, for confounding factors. It’s most likely that children’s deaths attributed to COVID-19 in fact are from multiple organ failure resulting from the combination of the drug cocktail and ventilation that these children are subjected to.  Dr. Alexov therefore asserted that:  the WHO is creating worldwide chaos, with no real facts behind what they’re saying.”  Among the myriad ways the WHO is creating that chaos is by prohibiting almost all autopsies of people deemed to have died from COVID-19. As a result, reported Dr. Alexov, by May 13 only three such autopsies had been conducted in Bulgaria.  Also, the WHO is dictating that everyone said to be infected with the novel coronavirus who subsequently dies must have their deaths attributed to COVID-19.  “That’s quite stressful for us, and for me in particular, because we have protocols and procedures which we need to use,” he told Dr. Katsarov. “…And another pathologist 100 years from now is going to say, ‘Hey, those pathologists didn’t know what they were doing [when they said the cause of death was COVID-19]!’ So we need to be really strict with our diagnoses, because they could be proven [or disproven], and they could be checked again later.”  He disclosed that pathologists in several countries in Europe, as well as in China, Australia and Canada are strongly resisting the pressure on them to attribute deaths to COVID-19 alone:  I’m really sad that we need to follow the [WHO’s] instructions without even thinking about them. But in Germany, France, Italy and England they’re starting to think that we shouldn’t follow the WHO so strictly, and [instead] when we’re writing the cause of death we should have some pathology [results to back that up] and we should follow the protocol. [That’s because] when we say something we need to be able to prove it.”  He added that autopsies could have helped confirm or disprove the theory that many of the people deemed to have died of COVID-19 in Italy had previously received the H1N1 flu vaccine. Because, as he noted, the vaccine suppresses adults’ immune systems and therefore may have been a significant contributor to their deaths by making them much more susceptible to infection.  Drs. Alexov and Katsarov agreed that yet another aspect of the WHO-caused chaos and its fatal consequences is many people are likely to die soon from diseases such as cancer because the lockdowns, combined with the emptying of hospitals ostensibly to make room for COVID-19 patients, halted all but the most pressing procedures and treatments.  They also observed these diseases are being exacerbated by the fear and chaos surrounding COVID-19.  We know that stress significantly suppresses the immune system, so I can really claim 200% that all the chronic diseases will be more severe and more acute per se. Specifically in situ carcinoma – over 50% of these are going to become more invasive […] So I will say that this epidemic isn’t so much an epidemic of the virus, it’s an epidemic of giving people a lot of fear and stress.”  In addition, posited Dr. Alexov, as another direct and dire result of the pandemic panic many people are losing faith in physicians.  Because in my opinion the coronavirus isn’t that dangerous, and how are people going to have trust in me doing cancer pathology, much of which is related to viruses as well? But nobody is talking about that.”  We emailed Dr. Alexov several questions, including asking why he believes it’s impossible to create a vaccine against COVID-19.  He didn’t answer the questions directly. Dr. Alexov instead responded:  We also emailed five of Dr. Alexov’s colleagues in the ESP asking them to confirm Dr. Alexov’s revelations. We followed up by telephone with two of them. None responded.  Why didn’t Dr. Alexov or his five colleagues answer our questions?  We doubt it’s due to lack of English proficiency.  It’s more likely because of the pressure on pathologists to follow the WHO’s directives and not speak out publicly. And, on top of that, pathology departments depend on governments for their funding.  Nonetheless, pathologists like Drs. Alexov and Püschel appear to be willing to step out and say that no one has died from a novel-coronavirus infection.  Perhaps that’s because pathologists’ records and reputations are based on hard physical evidence rather than on subjective interpretation of tests, signs and symptoms. And there is no hard physical evidence that COVID-19 is deadly.

3c791c29,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to devastate the world in ways no one ever imagined, some are questioning whether China is lying about the extent of COVID-19’s impact on its own country.  Officially, China reported nearly 82,000 cases of the coronavirus and around 3,300 deaths, with only a handful of new cases each day, and announced the country is largely in recovery as China ended its lockdown of Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the outbreak began. In comparison, the United States reported nearly 500,000 cases of the coronavirus around the country and more than 18,000 deaths by the disease – a figure some officials even believe is under-reported, despite grossly surpassing the numbers coming out of China.    Advertisement    So when major cellphone carriers in China reported a loss in nearly 21 million subscriptions in January and February, some skeptics theorized that the number of phone numbers that disappeared from the original hotspot of the disease may correlate to the real number of lives lost to the novel coronavirus.  According to data published by the mobile carriers, China Mobile Ltd. saw a drop of nearly 7.25 million subscribers and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. lost 7.8 million subscribers in January and February, while China Telecom Corp. lost 5.6 million subscribers in February alone, the Associated Press reported.  China affairs expert Tang Jinyuan explained that having a cellphone and a cell subscription is married to daily life in China. “Dealing with the government for pensions and social security, buying train tickets, shopping … no matter what people want to do, they are required to use cellphones,” she said in an interview with the Epoch Times.    Advertisement    So does the sudden drop in subscribers necessarily point to the number of coronavirus-related fatalities in China? Dr. Samantha Hoffman, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says no.  “I don’t think those pieces of information prove anything at this point,” Hoffman told InsideEdition.com. “There are a lot of indicators that the numbers are wrong, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the telephone … data is proof of anything. I think that it’s too early to answer those questions.”  The number of cell phone subscribers could have dropped as businesses shuttered and work phone plans were cancelled, according to the Associated Press. Or, migrant workers may have cancelled their phone subscription for the region in which they worked when they weren’t able to return after leaving for their home region for Lunar New Year holidays, an analyst told Bloomberg.      Advertisement    However, Hoffman does believe that the state-released data is most likely not reflective of the real number of cases and deaths related to the coronavirus. “I think that the likelihood of these numbers being falsified is pretty high in my view,” she said. “To what degree? I’m not sure.”  She is not alone in believing that China’s data is falsified. U.S. intelligence officials also reported that China concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, according to both the New York Times and Fortune Magazine.  Hoffman explained factors other than the drop in cell phone subscriptions point to her conclusion, the most obvious one being China’s “long history of lying about death tolls.”        Another reason she believed the numbers were falsified goes back to the failures of China’s social credit system, a ranking system based on the reputation of each citizen and business. “It’s a system that uses technology to augment existing forms of social and political control,” Hoffman said.  Similar to how each person has a credit score in the United States, a Chinese citizen’s social credit score can move up and down depending on their positive or negative behavior, like failing to pay debts, being convicted of crimes or even smoking in non-smoking areas. Someone with a poor social credit score could be restricted from flights or trains, barred from receiving high-speed internet or be rejected from entrance to the most elite schools, according to Business Insider.  In the wake of the coronavirus, citizens were required to report their travel and medical history, and their answer would factor into their social credit score. “In Beijing for instance, anybody returning from overseas failing to report or misreport their health condition would be included,” Hoffman explained.  However, people are also penalized in the social credit system for spreading fake news or rumors, which could be problematic in China, where there the line between the distinction of spreading rumors and alerting the public to a potential pandemic such as the coronavirus is blurred.  “Spreading rumors is such a politicized charge in the [People’s Republic of China]. Are there people spreading false rumors? Yeah, probably there are in every country … but the problem is how do you define that? And for the [Chinese Communist] Party that could just be whistle-blowing,” Hoffman said. “I think that’s actually more concerning because we already know that there were people who were trying to get the word out about the crisis back when it seemed the party was concealing the severity of the outbreak.”  For those reasons, Hoffman said, it’s hard to gauge the real number of coronavirus cases and deaths in China, despite some social media claims that the number of deaths could be as high as ten times the officially reported figure.  And the implications of China’s potential false reporting could be why we see some countries devastated by the coronavirus, Hoffman said.  “It definitely impacted a global response and how seriously governments were taking this as a threat and how serious people were taking it as a threat as they chose to continue traveling or chose to continue living their normal lives,” she said. “Those are decisions that would have potentially been changed, had information been clear earlier on.”  U.S. officials agreed. “The data set matters … [saving lives] depends on the ability to have confidence and information about what actually transpired,” U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement to press.  “The reality is we could have been better off if China has been more forthcoming,” Vice President Mike Pence told CNN.  And as America continues to grapple with its own outbreak, with an apex more imminent with each passing day, Hoffman’s concern is with the long-term effects of China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.  “In the long term, this technology for collecting data for the social credit system can be a lot more problematic and a lot more powerful,” Hoffman said. “There are a lot of risks, and all of it points to the [Chinese Communist] Party using technology to better expand its power. I think we just sort of had a glimpse of what that looks like with this crisis.”",Why Did 21 Million Phone Numbers Disappear from China After Coronavirus Outbreak?,FALSE

ae0c3741,"Senate Democrats Fail Taxpayers, Local Governments, Job Seekers, and Middle-Class Families; Instead, they Deliver for Criminals, Illegal Immigrants, and the Far Left Fringe  Crafted entirely by Democrats in total control of New York’s new one-party government, the 2019-20 state budget includes billions of dollars in new taxes and spending that will make it even more difficult for hardworking, middle-class taxpayers to provide for their families and make ends meet.  The budget includes a multitude of unfunded mandates that will drastically hamper the viability of local governments, and will also enact catastrophic changes to New York’s criminal justice system which will enhance the rights of dangerous criminals over law-abiding citizens.  “After months of warning about the disastrous effects of one-party government, New York’s worst nightmare has been realized with the 2019-20 state budget. Not only have Senate Democrats betrayed the hardworking taxpayers they are supposed to represent – they have focused virtually all of their energy on delivering for criminals and illegal immigrants, and appeasing the radical, socialist fringe that now controls their party. By voting for this disastrous spending plan, Democrats have totally turned their backs on local governments and middle-class families struggling through New York’s growing affordability crisis. Our great state deserves a much better budget,” said Senate Republican Leader John J. Flanagan.  New taxes and fees to be enacted by Senate Democrats in the state budget include:  A new tax on internet purchases, with an overwhelming majority of the revenue raised to be funneled to fund New York City priorities;  A new tax on prescription drugs and medications, which would harm seniors and our most vulnerable populations;  A new commuter tax that will hurt motorists in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island;  A new tax on driving that will devastate Upstate New York’s tourism industry;  A new tax on real estate transactions;  A new grocery bag tax, which will require anyone who needs food or other basic necessities to dig a little deeper into their pockets; and  A planned taxpayer-funded political campaign system, AKA “welfare for politicians,” through actions to be implemented by a commission which will ultimately require taxpayer dollars to fund negative campaign mailers and robocalls.  Senate Democrats once promised they wouldn’t raise taxes, but instead picked up right where they left off in 2009-10, when they raised taxes and fees 124 times, totaling $14 billion in just two years. The fiscally irresponsible trend continues today with the imminent passage of the state budget, as Senate Democrats are approving billions in new taxes that are still being tabulated. On top of accelerating the affordability crisis plaguing millions of New Yorkers who have been forced to leave for more affordable areas of the country, the spending plan does nothing to address the Senate Democrats’ outright rejection of the Amazon HQ2 plan, which cost New York 25,000 new jobs and $27 billion in new revenue.  The budget includes no increase in CHIPs funding and cuts to extreme winter recovery funds by $65 million, while fronting the MTA $100 million to pave the way for implementation of the new commuter tax. It also cuts AIM funding by $59 million, and for the first time ever, the budget awards Governor Cuomo with $5 million in bullet aid.  Since the beginning of the 2019 session, Senate Republicans have offered various amendments and proposals to these job-killing tax-and-spend policies, including:  Balancing the budget without raising or creating new taxes and fees;  Enshrining the state spending cap into law, which would ensure that Democrats can never again blow past fiscally responsible levels concerning how they spend the taxpayer dollar;  Accelerating and protecting the historic Middle Class Income Tax Cut previously enacted by Senate Republicans, which has already saved New Yorkers $770 million, and is one of the largest and most important tax cuts in state history;  Implementing significant business and energy tax cuts and regulatory reforms, so that there are fewer obstacles to creating new jobs in New York;  Reforming the voting procedure for the Public Authorities Control Board to require a majority vote on economic development projects, so that any one Senator can never again single-handedly cost New York thousands of jobs and billions in new revenue due to political considerations.  Despite many assurances by the Governor and Democrats in the Legislature, the state budget fails to reject various unfunded mandates, and most notably excludes adequate funding needed to implement the state’s early voting mandate. The New York State Board of Elections estimates that early voting will cost $175 million, a number far greater than the $25 million local governments will receive from the state. This reckless action will put additional pressure on towns, villages, and counties to raise taxes or cut essential services.  “We’re one of the few states experiencing a decrease in population and, in a recent survey, nearly half of our young people said they are on their way out. Our next generation of entrepreneurs, local leaders, and families are set to flee the state and this budget will not change their minds. The budget increases taxes, does nothing to help struggling small businesses, ignores our upstate roads, and slaps more unfunded mandates on local governments. Improving affordability and boosting economic development were my priorities at the start of the budget process and this plan falls flat on both concerns,” said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Republican Senator James L. Seward.  Passed annually, the New York State Budget is supposed to be as much a reflection of policy values as it is about being fiscally responsible with taxpayer money. Because of the new one-party government in New York, other Democrat-driven priorities that made it into the final budget include:  Fully funding an initiative to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrants, while rejecting an increase in Tuition Assistance Program funding that would help middle-class families afford college;  Allowing cashless bail, which will let violent, hardened criminals out onto the streets with no consequence or regard for public safety;  Disproportionately underfunding school aid, with a far greater amount dedicated to New York City schools, effectively shorting aid for every other part of the state; and  Keeping the Hollywood Film Tax Credit, despite Senate Democrats’ previous opposition to corporate incentives, such as for Amazon HQ2.  After being negotiated with little to no transparency for months by leaders of the new one-party government without garnering input from members of the minorities in both houses, passage of the 2019-20 state budget will garner an overwhelming majority of its yes votes from Democrats and New York City-located officials. The budget will create and raises taxes and spending by billions despite previous claims from the Governor’s Budget Director and Comptroller that the state was facing a multi-billion dollar deficit.",New State Budget Is New Yorkers’ Worst Nightmare,partially false
da910b12,"As a father, I have felt the heartbreak of drug abuse. My daughter Noelle suffered from addiction, and like many parents facing similar situations, her mom and I struggled to help. I have so many friends and know so many families who have faced this terrible challenge. Addiction crosses all barriers, all lines, all races and all incomes. It creates real hardship and heartbreak in families. And, it places substantial demands on government at every level. I never expected to see my precious daughter in jail. It wasn’t easy, and it became very public when I was Governor of Florida, making things even more difficult for Noelle. She went through hell, so did her mom, and so did I. It’s very debilitating when you have a loved one who is struggling, and you can’t control it. You have to love them, but you also have to make it clear you cannot enable the behavior that gets them in trouble. Showing a lot of courage, Noelle graduated from drug court. Drug courts use a restorative solution model involving multi-disciplinary coordination, including the judiciary, the prosecution, mental health specialists, social services and treatment professionals. I was the proud dad that saw Noelle finish that. She’s drug-free now. As Governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent. As President, I will lead this country to dramatically reduce drug abuse. The country’s massive heroin and illicit drug epidemic is compounded and fueled by sharp increases in the abuse of prescription painkillers. The problem is exacerbated by huge increases in the availability of cheap, highly potent heroin, primarily the result of Mexican drug cartels getting involved in the production, trafficking and distribution of heroin and other illicit drugs. Some label the drug abuse epidemic just a criminal justice issue, and some try to make it just a health care issue. Both approaches oversimplify this complex and heartbreaking challenge. It is imperative to reduce both the demand and supply if treatment and recovery programs are going to work. To win this fight across the country, I believe we need a multi-faceted strategy that: Prevents drug abuse and addiction before it begins: Drug abuse and addiction prevention efforts must start in childhood. That begins with dedicated parents, strong communities and local education. The private sector must also be committed to joining this fight to achieve success, including coalitions driven by local communities and involving health, local law enforcement and social services professionals. When I was governor of Florida, my wife Columba took a very active role in prevention efforts with children; treatment facilities focusing on women with children and struggling children; and coordination of a resource network for local communities at the county level. Strengthens criminal justice: I will ensure federal law enforcement agencies have the resources they need, support policies that distinguish pill mills from evidence-based pain clinics, and broaden access to drug courts, an alternative to the traditional punishment system so that nonviolent drug offenders obtain treatment and recovery support. I will also enact smarter sentencing laws for drug offenders, with stiff consequences for drug lords, cartels and violent drug traffickers, while ensuring nonviolent drug offenders obtain the necessary treatment and more quickly return to their communities with reduced mandatory sentences. Secures the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs: I will secure the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, given that most heroin enters the United States from Mexico. I will work with partner nations, such as Mexico, Colombia and Afghanistan, to address the source of illicit drugs and interdict illicit drug trafficking. Improves drug abuse treatment and recovery programs: I will strengthen and coordinate Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) to monitor and analyze electronic prescribing and dispensing data. I will promote innovation for a suite of treatment and recovery tools that align with individuals’ unique medical needs and beliefs. And I will conduct a rigorous evaluation of existing prevention, treatment and recovery programs to ensure funding supports evidence-based programs that consistently monitor results. Drug abuse and addiction hurts Americans from all walks of life. It is a complex problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted solution. It will take real leadership that makes solving the problem a top priority. I’ve successfully fought this epidemic as a Governor, but more importantly, I’ve experienced it as a father.

""We have received a number of calls regarding how to enter security information for a baby that has not yet been born,"" Shafer wrote. ""Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. It’s an easy process."" The newsletter then proceeds to spell out how ""the baby’s security information should be entered"" into the White House system, including such details as: ""GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as we’ll ask you to update it at the time of birth."" All of the information should be updated ""once, the baby is born,"" the newsletter instructs. ""It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth,” said Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life legislative director. “Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted. On May 17, the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 3803), which would generally prohibit abortion in the sixth month and later in the District. If the President wants to provide for the security of the unborn child immediately outside of the White House gates, as well as inside, he should endorse this bill."" Further information on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is available on the NRLC website at http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/Fetal_Pain/index.html Founded in 1968, the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), the federation of 50 state right-to-life affiliates and more than 3,000 local chapters, is the nation's oldest and largest grassroots pro-life organization.

50b510f0,"WASHINGTON, DC – The House of Representatives today voted 217-212 to pass H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Initial estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the underlying legislation will take away coverage from 24 million Americans over the next decade, including seven million Americans currently covered by their employers. The bill cuts $838 billion from Medicaid, and will dramatically increase out-of-pocket costs, particularly for lower-income families and older Americans. An ""age tax"" imposed on those ages 50-64 will force this age group to pay up to five times as much as a younger person for coverage. It also completely defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, further restricting low-income women’s access to affordable healthcare for pregnancy tests, cancer screening, and family planning. All of these cuts to middle class Americans’ health care are used to finance a $1 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest families, insurance companies, and insurance executives. The version that passed today was amended to allow states to create high risk pools instead of requiring insurance companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions. Rather than protecting those with pre-existing conditions, high-risk pools leave sick people vulnerable to skyrocketing costs, long waiting lists, and annual or lifetime caps. The bill also allows states to opt out of requirements to cover essential health benefits, like doctor and emergency room visits, mental health services, and prescription drugs. Rep. Chu voted against the bill and released the following statement: “I am incredibly saddened and outraged that Republicans ignored the expressed opposition from doctors, hospitals, patient advocates, health experts and even members of their own party to pass this heartless bill. It is unconscionable to me that they would charge ahead with – and then celebrate – a vote that they know will force millions off their insurance and raise prices for people with preexisting conditions. Worse, their rush to vote on this bill meant there wasn’t even time for the Congressional Budget Office to score the fiscal and human costs of the final version. The haste to act and then immediately hop on a bus to the White House shows that they were more concerned with helping Trump keep a campaign promise than with actually improving healthcare. “This bill will have serious consequences for the people of California in particular. One provision of this bill would deny subsidies to any healthcare plan that covers abortion. Meaning that in California, where all plans are required to cover abortion, healthcare costs will rise astronomically because Californians will be ineligible for tax credits. This bill also threatens to kick 7 million veterans off their insurance, shortens the life of Medicare, allows people aged 50-64 to be charged 5 times more than young people, and eliminates coverage for 24 million Americans, including nearly 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders across the country. It defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, and would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition. This bill creates a 'women’s tax' that would permit insurance companies to charge women more than men for essential coverage like pregnancy. Trumpcare would cut $838 billion from Medicaid, endangering care for individuals with disabilities, low-income children, and seniors in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In the midst of the worst opioid epidemic our nation has ever seen, it rips mental health and addiction services away from those who need it most. Trumpcare does all this while giving the 400 richest families in America an annual tax break of $2.8 million. “As we have said in the past, Democrats remain willing and eager to work to improve the Affordable Care Act. But this was not an improvement. This was a cruel attack on vulnerable Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. An improvement is a plan that will increase access for all Americans, keep costs down, and ensure that being sick or a woman or a senior is not an excuse to be denied coverage.”","Carbon dioxide didn't create climate crisis, says leading skeptic",partially false

Global warming so fully occupies the thinking of some that there’s no room for information that will contradict their faith. If they’d only open their minds they’d see: The U.S. hasn’t warmed since 2005. America isn’t the entire world. But the alarmists gleefully point out regional heatwaves and the “hottest day on record” when cities endure summer scorchers. So let’s look at the data. The U.S. Climate Reference Network, “a . America isn’t the entire world. But the alarmists gleefully point out regional heatwaves and the “hottest day on record” when cities endure summer scorchers. So let’s look at the data. The U.S. Climate Reference Network, “a sophisticated climate-observing network specifically designed and deployed for quantifying climate change on a national scale,” has found there’s been no warming in the U.S. going back to 2005. In fact, says meteorologist Anthony Watts, the “little known data from the state-of-the-art” operation, “(which never seems to make it into NOAA’s monthly ‘state of the climate’ reports) show that for the past nine months, six of them were below normal .” The data also tell us 2019’s average has been cooler than 2005’s, the first year of the data set. Man’s carbon dioxide emissions are not burning down the Amazon. Empty-headed celebrities and activists have had quite a virtue-signaling feast tweeting photos from fires three decades ago, fires in Europe, and fires in the U.S. Yes, we’ve seen the claims that there are 80% more fires this year than last in South America, but we’ve also seen this from the New York Times: “The majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture.” lockerdome.com is blocked Requests to the server have been blocked by an extension.

It was a turning point — the ‘greenhouse effect’ captured attention. But, in 1999 it became clear that carbon dioxide rose and fell after temperatures did . By 2003, we had better data showing the lag was 800 ± 200 years. CO2 was in the back seat.” Of course the climate crusaders have written at great length to tell us it’s all just a myth. This time, they say, the warming ( which is in doubt ) is caused by man. It just has to be. All those other warming periods, the alarmists tell us, can be explained by natural events, such as Earth’s orbit around the sun, which, incidentally, we have mentioned as one of many factors that influence climate changes Less than 5% of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by man. Web searches turn up what seems like an endless list of stories and blog posts reporting that CO2 levels in the atmosphere have reached or exceeded 415 parts per million. This has been almost universally treated as the tip of an imminent disaster, as man has pushed greenhouse gas emissions beyond a dangerous threshold. But has he? The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “agrees today’s annual human carbon dioxide emissions are 4.5 ppm (parts per million) per year and nature’s carbon dioxide emissions are 98 ppm per year,” says climate scientist Ed Berry. “Yet, the IPCC claims human emissions have caused all the increase in carbon dioxide since 1750, which is 30% of today’s total. “How can human carbon dioxide, which is less than 5% of natural carbon dioxide, cause 30% of today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide? It can’t .” Don’t like Berry’s numbers? Consider another set of figures from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, which says that of the 750 gigatons of CO2 which travel through the carbon cycle every year, only 29 gigatons, or less than 4%, are produced by man. Is it possible for such a small portion to have such a great influence? Despite what the hysterics tell us, it’s an unanswered question. There are many other unanswered questions about climate, as well. An honest person would admit that they might remain unanswered forever.

Sabbatical Officers Roisin McCallion (left), Vice President for Welfare and Equal Opportunity and Ebie Edwards Cole (right), Chair for Oxford SU Disabilities Campaign, successfully passed the motion to mandate the encouragement of silent clapping They argued that alternatives to traditional clapping have been in place to aid accessibility in some organisations since 2015. The ban on clapping would be at student union meetings and events where traditional clapping and cheering 'presents an access issue' to those with anxiety disorders. One former student, said: 'Oxford University Student Union is always seeking to be more accommodating for students. Especially for those with accessibility issues. 'But this idea will not work and is completely ludicrous.' The use of jazz hands - where students wave their hands in the air - is the British Sign Language expression for applause and is deemed a more inclusive gesture. The motion, which carried, mandates the encouragement of sign language clapping by Sabbatical Officers at union meetings and events (file photo of students at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford) It comes after the University of Manchester Students Union passed a motion to do the same thing in September last year.

6d87d9ce,"The harm from shielding steel and aluminum makers from exports will outweigh any benefits. “Trade wars,” President Donald Trump recently declared on Twitter, “are good, and easy to win.” But it’s questionable whether the president’s proposed tariffs -- a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum -- will be a war or an act of friendly fire. As I recently wrote, tariffs are generally not a good way to promote domestic industry. They encourage American producers to hunker down behind the tax’s protective wall, focusing on the captive local market instead of figuring out how to prevail in the rough-and-tumble of global competition. Forcing American consumers to use the domestic-made product might eventually result in American steel and aluminum becoming bywords for low quality. There’s also the danger that making metals more expensive will hurt a lot more U.S. manufacturers than it helps. The construction industry would take the biggest hit: Where the Pain Would Be Felt the Most Share of total U.S. steel use by industry Import taxes will tend to drive already exorbitant U.S. construction costs even higher, hurting commercial development around the country. It will also harm U.S. exporters. The U.S. makes a lot of internationally tradeable products that use steel -- aircraft, autos, appliances and industrial machinery. A lot of others use aluminum. Although the majority of what they use is produced locally -- the U.S. steel industry supplied about 70 percent of the domestic market in 2017 -- a tax on imports will allow American metal producers to charge more to companies like Boeing Co., General Motors Co. and Whirlpool Corp. Higher steel and aluminum company profits will therefore come at the expense of these other American manufacturers -- exporters like Caterpillar Inc. and Harley-Davidson Inc. are already warning that the tariff would put them at a competitive disadvantage in world markets. No wonder shares of these companies slid after the tariff plan was announced: So Trump’s ham-fisted attempts to protect one American industry seem likely to deal a blow to many others. This is the exact opposite of the increased international manufacturing prowess that Trump has promised. Defenders of the tariffs argue that steel and aluminum are important for national defense, and so need to be protected even at the cost of less martial industries. But military shipbuilders will be hurt by higher metals prices, as will makers of tanks, planes, guns and other crucial defense equipment. Nor will the tariffs bring back good jobs at steel and aluminum factories. Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily: Look Elsewhere for the Growth Story of Tomorrow Industrial production of primary metal* Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Index 2012 = 100 Doing the Same With Fewer People Employment in primary metals production Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis The reason is technology. Productivity has improved, even as demand has stayed more or less constant. Mathematically, that means fewer jobs for steel and aluminum workers. Tariffs won’t change that equation. If anything, by hurting downstream industries like car and equipment manufacturers, the new import taxes will probably kill more factory jobs than they save. So Trump’s metals tariffs look likely to be a self-inflicted wound for the U.S. -- even if they don’t spark retaliation from trading partners, and even if they don’t weaken American alliances. If Trump wants to help the steel and aluminum industries, there are better ways to do it. Instead of letting U.S. metal-makers charge higher prices to other American industries, the government could focus on helping to raise exports. The reason domestic steel production hasn’t grown isn’t because of cheap imports; it’s the fact that the U.S. market hasn’t grown. The U.S. is a mature economy with a lot of existing buildings, infrastructure and vehicles, meaning that its consumption of metal can be expected to grow only slowly. Countries in Asia and Africa, however, need lots of new steel to fuel their economic development. The U.S., which makes higher-quality steel than countries like China, could potentially be supplying much of those countries’ needs. Currently, U.S. steel companies command only 2 percent of world exports, compared with 24 percent by China. There are things the government could do to improve that situation, including export promotion, export loans and assistance for small producers looking to break into world markets. Selling more steel and aluminum abroad is a much better bet than trying to capture a bigger slice of a stagnating pie back home. So far, though, Trump has shown more interest in trade war for its own sake than in actually helping U.S. companies compete. Tariffs might make Trump and his diehard followers feel better, but they’ll hurt more American pocketbooks than they benefit.","Poor N.J. districts must receive $500M more in school funding, state Supreme Court rules",TRUE
a4514f88,"RUSH: Trump backs out of the Paris accords. Oh, do we have news on climate change today based on what happened in a courtroom in California. Let me give you the bare upshot of this. There’s a lawsuit being filed against the fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Texaco and — there’s five of ’em. And the suit has been brought by environmentalist wackos. They claim that all of these fossil fuel companies know that they are destroying the planet and are hiding the evidence. They claim in their lawsuit that they know that their business is creating the circumstances that cause climate change. So they filed this massive lawsuit. The judge in this case decided to have a little seminar before the trial actually began. And the climate change environmentalist wackos thought, “Oh, my God, this is a godsend. We’re gonna get to go in and we’re gonna rip these people a new one even before the trial begins.” But what happened was the judge is an educated and informed person when it comes to climate change, even though the judge is in California. And the upshot of it is that the environmentalist wackos were made fools of. They demonstrated they are lying. For example, one of these they said they had was a smoking gun memo, a smoking gun memo at Exxon and some of these other fossil fuel companies where they admit to themselves, internal memo, that they are destroying the planet, that they are engaging in activities causing massive amounts of C2O, causing greenhouse gases and the planet only has so much time. So the judge said, “Well, let me see. You say they’ve got it. Where is it? What does it say?” And the fossil fuel companies eagerly produced it. You know what it was? It was a slideshow from a U.N. presentation on the international committee of planetary whatever, the IPCC, whatever that stands for. It was simply a slideshow that the U.N. put together, that the environmentalist wackos have been lying about claiming it’s a smoking gun memo from the fossil fuel companies. The judge just made mincemeat of these people, demonstrated they’re lying, demonstrated they don’t know what they’re talking about and that there is no substance to their allegations at all. This is before the trial even began. And the trial has not yet begun. This was a preliminary stage. So the wackos have to go back now and reformulate their whole plan since their basic approach has just been nuked in court, since they have been exposed as lying, making things up. And, of course, everybody that believes in climate change believes what these wackos have been saying, so the world thought that these companies were gonna have their hats handed to ’em even before the trial began. And what ended up happening was the judge exposing the slime tactics of the environmentalist wackos. RUSH: I mentioned earlier in the program that the environmentalist wackos had their lunch handed to ’em in court out in California. I want to give you the details of this. ‘Cause any time there is a win, I’m gonna tell you about it. Any time there’s a reason for optimism, I’m gonna tell you about it. Any time the left takes it on the chin, I’m gonna tell you about it. Now, the Drive-Bys have reported the story, but they haven’t gone anywhere near what is really salient about it.I have here a column in the Wall Street Journal by Phelim McAleer. “Climate Alarmists May Inherit the Wind — They likened a courtroom ‘tutorial’ to the Scopes Monkey Trial. But their side got schooled.” Here’s the upshot of this story. “Five American oil companies find themselves in a San Francisco courtroom. California v. Chevron is a civil action brought by the city attorneys of San Francisco and Oakland, who accuse the defendants of creating a ‘public nuisance’ by contributing to climate change and of conspiring to cover it up so they could continue to profit.” Again, civil action, not criminal, meaning there would be damages if Big Oil is found liable here. And essentially the Drive-Bys and the environmentalist wackos thought they had stumbled across a brilliant maneuver, and that is to have global warming and climate change codified in law by having a court acknowledge that it exists and find these defendants liable. That was their plan. There was no date for the trial so far. However, on March 21st, a mere 10 to 11 days ago, “the litigants gathered for a ‘climate change tutorial'” that was ordered by the judge. The judge’s name is William Alsup. Now, the environmentalist wackos thought this was a gift from nirvana, since they don’t believe in heaven. They couldn’t believe their good luck, a climate change tutorial. You have to remember who these people are. The biggest obstacle that we’re up against in America, aside from the cultural rot, but I think the reason the cultural rot is taking place is we’re up against genuine stupidity. Too many generations have literally been taught nothing, including how to think. And so we’re up against — you may want to call it ignorance, but we’re up against genuine stupidity. And even among these environmentalist wackos and these city attorneys, they believe all of this claptrap that they have been saying about climate change all of these years, even though there isn’t any evidence for it. There isn’t any warming. All they’ve got is computer model predictions, folks. There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for their claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase. There isn’t any empirical data for that. All of this is based on the come: Oh, my God, this is terrible, we can’t afford not to wait, we have to stop it. But there isn’t any truth. Not to mention the fact the last 15 years there hasn’t been any warming. Also, NOAA has been caught cheating and altering the annual temperature charts to show more warming than there has been, but it doesn’t matter. Because all of these environmentalist wackos and everybody who believes them and their city attorneys, they literally believe this stuff, just like they literally believe all the things they hate Trump for, they literally believe this. Like they believe Russia colluded with Trump, but it didn’t happen, there isn’t any evidence, but they’re convinced, they believe it. They’ve been saying it so long, thinking it so long, it’s gotta be true. So they walk into this courtroom, and they’re thinking this is it, this is where they’re gonna win every case. They’re gonna have a firmly established by a judge now that there is climate change. And once a court says it, that ends it, it doesn’t matter what other scientists say, it’s over. And that’s what they thought they were on the verge of, they were so excited. They could not contain themselves. But they didn’t know about Judge William Alsup. The environmentalist wackos were so excited about this that they had spectators, they had a giant crowd gathered outside the courtroom at 6 a.m. on March 21st, urged on by the advocates and their websites. And there were all kinds of signs, “Buckle up, polluters! You’re in for it now.” And they said this is gonna be the equivalent of the Scopes Monkey Trial. But in the end, it did not go well for the environmentalist wackos. And not for lack of legal talent. “Steve W. Berman, who represented the cities, is a star trial lawyer who has made a career and a fortune suing corporations for large settlements, including the $200 billion-plus tobacco settlement in 1998.” He was one of those lawyers. Michael Burger of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told one of the websites getting the crowd to show up, “Until now, fossil fuel companies have been able to talk about climate science in political and media arenas where there is far less accountability to the truth.” Now, wait just a minute. Before we go further, stop and think of this line: “Until now, fossil fuel companies have been able to talk about climate science in political and media arenas where there is far less accountability to the truth.” In other words, if you want truth, do not involve journalism. If you want to find the truth, do not go anywhere near politics or journalism, because there isn’t any accountability to the truth in journalism. That, to me, is a humongous indictment, and that comes from a pro-climate change lawyer.“Judge Alsup started quietly. He flattered the plaintiffs’ first witness, Oxford physicist Myles Allen.” Judge Alsup called this physicist from Oxford a genius. He set him up. This guy’s standing there feeling his oats, he’s a genius, climate science genius, judge knows it. But then the judge reprimanded this physicist “for using a misleading illustration to represent carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and a graph ostensibly about temperature rise that did not actually show rising temperatures.” So the wackos, they brought their charts, and they brought their graphs, and their charts and graphs are made up BS. And they always have been. And the judge called an Oxford physicist, I mean, the epitome of a white lab coat scientist. And this guy was chopped off at the knees. The judge chastised this guy for using a misleading illustration to show carbon in the atmosphere. In other words, there wasn’t nearly as much in the atmosphere as this guy’s chart showed. And his graph about temperature increase did not show temperature increase. He just brought a complicated bunch of charts and graphs, said this is what it represents. The judge said, “Wait, what is that? What is that? What is that?” The judge illustrated that they were using bogus data so now they’re thinking, uh-oh, we got somebody who knows what we’re talking about here in the form of a judge. They thought, a San Francisco judge? This is gonna be a cakewalk. “Then the pointed questions began. Gary Griggs, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, struggled with the judge’s simple query: ‘What do you think caused the last Ice Age?'” Now, stick with me on this. “What caused the last Ice Age?” Remember, they are there to claim that all of these oil companies are causing uncontrollable warming. The judge says, “What do you think caused the last Ice Age?” The professor — you ready for this? — the professor said, well, there was a wobble in the earth’s orbit. And he went to describe the period, quote, “before there were humans on the planet,” which “we call hothouse Earth.” “‘That was when ‘all the ice melted. We had fossils of palm trees and alligators in the Arctic,’ Mr. Griggs told the court. He added that at one time the sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than today. Mr. Griggs then recounted ‘a period called “snow ballers,”‘ when scientists ‘think the entire Earth was frozen due to changes in things like methane released from the ocean.'” Remember, these accounts of two apocalyptic climate events occurred naturally from a witness for plaintiffs hoping to prove that oil companies are causing warming and he was forced to admit that both warming and cooling happened in catastrophic ways long before there were oil companies. They were forced to deal with their actual claims, and a judge made mincemeat of them! They finally had an opponent who was informed and not sympathetic like the media is, and they were so embarrassed, and maybe more so than they even have the ability to understand. RUSH: One more thing about this tutorial in the San Francisco court with the environmentalist wackos suing five American oil companies for causing climate change and knowing it, polluting greenhouse gases and knowing it. The judge handed lunch to these people. The environmentalist wackos were humiliated and embarrassed in one other way. The plaintiff’s lawyer made a claim that there was a smoking gun document that the oil companies had, a memo that they had sent and read, prepared for each other that admitted they were polluting, admitted that fossil fuels as a business caused climate change. So the judge asked to see it. “The plaintiffs alleged that the oil companies were in possession of ‘smoking gun’ documents that would prove their liability,” and one of the lawyers, Theodore Boutrous, “said this was simply an internal summary of the publicly available 1995 IPCC report,” which is a U.N. organization. So the environmentalist wackos claimed there is a smoking-gun document that proves the oil companies know they are polluting. The judge asked to see it. What it turns out to be is nothing more than a United Nations-written internal summary of the publicly available U.N. 1995 International Panel On Climate Change report. The oil companies didn’t write it. It’s not a smoking gun. All it was was a political document written by the U.N. that was available publicly. It was a summary, you know, like two pages to summarize what’s in 500 pages. They got caught lying! The environmentalist wackos were lying claiming there was a smoking gun memo and document when it turns out it was nothing more than a U.N. summary of a report they had written in ’95 blaming the oil companies. “The judge said he read the lawsuit’s allegations to mean ‘that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner. And I said: “OK, that’s going to be a big thing. I want to see it.” Well, it turned out it wasn’t quite that. What it was, was a slide show that somebody had gone to the IPCC and was reporting on what the IPCC had reported, and that was it. Nothing more.'”
There was no smoking-gun memo. The lawyers for the environmentalist wackos had totally made it up and lied about it. So they were on notice. The judge said, “If you want to respond, I’ll let you respond. Is there anything you want to say?” And the lawyer for the wackos said, “No.” Whereupon the judge adjourned the proceedings. This is all before the trial even starts, folks. And so they were smoked. They were exposed as the frauds that they are. It was shown how they’re making things up and lying, how the media simply regurgitates it because they even admit here, the media is nowhere to go for accountability to truth.

Video: Cannabis smoking in front of prison guards See our special report on prisons under pressure She said the government was investing an extra £100m into the prisons estate, as well as hiring 2,500 more officers. Last year, thousands of staff walked out in protest over health and safety concerns, amid claims the prison system was in meltdown because of overcrowding and staff shortages. A number of serious disturbances also erupted in jails. media captionJustice Secretary Liz Truss says dealing with prison suicides is a huge priority The MOJ figures show that in the 12 months to September 2016 there were: Seven suicides at Woodhill, in Milton Keynes - the jail with the highest number Five in Bristol and four each in Bedford, Exeter, Humber, Leeds and Manchester prisons A record 354 deaths in custody overall - up by about a third on 2015 Three apparent homicides - down from a record eight in 2015 Nearly 70 assaults every day - the number of serious attacks was up 28% 6,430 assaults on staff - up 40% on 2015. Of these, 761 were classed as serious Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said reducing the jail population was the only realistic way to make our prisons safe in the foreseeable future. Prisons in England in Wales are at 98% capacity, with 85,058 inmates, according to latest figures. The vast majority of inmates - 81,102 - are men. Mr Dawson added: We know that the worst outcomes happen in overcrowded prisons. media captionMichael Irwin was overwhelmed by a feeling of hopelessness in prison Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said suicide rates in prisons were a national scandal. The suicide rate in prisons is 10 times that in the community. So prisons are actually killing people. That shouldn't happen in our prisons. People should at least be safe, she said. Deborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest which works with inmates' families, said the prison estate was a broken system unable to deal with prisoners' problems, such as mental and physical ill health and addictions. Inquest after inquest highlights the same systemic failures, Ms Coles added. 'Desperate need' Professor Pamela Taylor, chairwoman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' forensic faculty, said that the prison estates' mental health teams were understaffed and struggling to help prisoners in desperate need. She said: In many cases there is no-one available to escort prisoners to in-prison clinics; from time to time, even when a psychiatrist goes to a prisoner's cell... there are not enough prison officers present and the cell door can't be unlocked for safety reasons. Her comments came after the Prisons Ombudsman found the criminal justice system did too little to protect a vulnerable inmate who electrocuted himself in prison. Dean Saunders, 25, died at HMP Chelmsford in Essex in January 2016. The MoJ said the rise in assaults had coincided with major changes to the prison regime, operating arrangements and culture in prisons over the last five years. It pointed to restructuring of the prison estate including staff reductions, which have reduced overall running costs, and an increasing awareness of gang culture and illicit psychoactive drugs in prisons. The ministry added: As well as the dangers to both physical and mental health, trading in these illicit drugs can lead to debt, violence and intimidation. £1.3bn plans Ms Truss said she had taken immediate action to stabilise the prison estate by tackling issues such as drugs and the use of phones that undermined security. She added: These are long-standing issues that will not be resolved in weeks or months but our wholesale reforms will lay the groundwork to transform our prisons, reduce reoffending and make our communities safer. In November, Ms Truss unveiled a White Paper detailing a £1.3bn investment in new prisons over five years, with plans for extra officers, drug tests and more autonomy for governors. The move followed calls from prison governors for an independent public inquiry into the increase in violence and suicides in jails.","Surprise, Surprise – Literally one hour after Biden was sworn in, the World Health Organization admitted that PCR testing produces  high amplification rates and results and a huge number of false positives.

0f461c45,"The number of people applying for UK university places has fallen by more than 25,000 4% on last year, data from the admissions service Ucas shows. The figures show a sharp decline in those applying to study nursing courses - down 19% - and a continued fall in the number of mature students, notably in England and Northern Ireland. The number of EU students planning to study in the UK has fallen by 5%. It is the first decline since fees were last increased in England, in 2012. Fees in England will increase to £9,250 this year, and student loans are subject to an increase in interest rates - rising from 4.6% to 6.1% from this autumn. University leaders said a number of factors could be fuelling the fall in applicants, including Brexit, higher fees and funding changes for trainee nurses and midwives. From 1 August, new nursing, midwifery and most allied health students in England will no longer receive NHS bursaries - instead, they will have access to the same student loans system as other students. Four nations The latest Ucas figures show the number of people who had applied to UK universities for the coming academic year by the 30 June deadline was 649,700 - compared with 674,890 in 2016. There have been reductions in applicants from all four countries in the UK. There were: 437,860 applications from students in England - down 5% from 459,430 last year 48,940 from Scotland - down 1% from 49,470 22,530 from Wales - down 5% from 23,740 20,290 from Northern Ireland - down 4% from 21,110 Applications from EU students fell from 51,850 in 2016 to 49,250 this year. However, applicants from overseas countries outside of the European Union are up 2%, from 69,300 in 2016 to 70,830 this year. There has been a significant drop in mature students those aged 25 and over in England and Northern Ireland - down 18% 11,190 and 13% 220 respectively. Dr Mark Corver, Ucas director of analysis and research, said: Within the figures, there are contrasting trends. How these trends translate into students at university and colleges will become clear over the next six weeks, as applicants get their results and secure their places and new applicants apply direct to Ucas's clearing process. Mature students Prof Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: The downward trend in mature student numbers is now one of the most pressing issues in fair access to higher education. Undoubtedly, the reasons behind the fall are complex and multiple, but universities and colleges should look to do what they can to reverse the decline in mature student applications, as a matter of urgency. studentsimage copyrightGetty Images Dame Julia Goodfellow, president of Universities UK, said universities recognised that there were a number of issues to address. Continuing to communicate to European applicants that they are welcome and enrich our education system is important, she said. The decline in part-time and mature student entrants must also be addressed. We recognise also the concern about the total cost of going to university. Any analysis needs to cover the cost of maintenance and the interest rate on the loans. Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said it would be a concern if EU students were being put off by the uncertainties of Brexit. It's positive that applications from overseas students outside the EU have risen slightly, he said. International students bring social and cultural diversity to our campuses and this benefits all students, and they contribute £25.8bn to the UK economy. The Department for Education pointed out that the number of 18-year-olds applying for university was at record levels despite the fall in the overall number of applicants. A spokeswoman said: Higher education reforms will give people more choice and universities will be expected to continue improving access and participation in higher education. The government is committed to supporting all young people to reach their full potential - whether that is going to university, starting an apprenticeship or taking up a technical qualification. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of MillionPlus, said the application data from Ucas was not good news. As predicted, the abolition of bursaries has depressed rather than increased applications for nursing and there will be no additional nurses trained in spite of ministers' assurances, she said. There is no doubt that the government's approach to Brexit is damaging and is creating huge uncertainties, both for EU students and UK universities.",On the Capitol: Part-time pay for part-time Legislature?,TRUE

a0d2aab0,"The number of homeless people in Japan has dropped to a 15-year low below 5,000, according to the welfare ministry, which credited municipal and prefectural efforts to help them regain independence. As of January, the ministry said Friday, 4,977 people were living in places such as riverbeds or parks, down 557 from a year ago and under 5,000 for the first time since it began surveying the ranks of the homeless in 2003. “Support measures from governments, such as counseling, are believed to have produced certain effects” that reduced the number of homeless people, a ministry official said. The survey was conducted by having local officials patrol communities to spot people without permanent dwellings. More than 90 percent of the total, or 4,607, were men and 177 were women, but the sex of the remaining 193 was left blank as they were bundled up in clothing when they were found. Three-quarters of the homeless were observed in Tokyo’s 23 wards or other major cities. Tokyo had 1,242 homeless, followed by Osaka with 1,110 and Kanagawa with 934. Six other prefectures — Aomori, Akita, Yamagata, Nara, Shimane and Nagasaki — reported no homeless people. The ministry noted, however, that the actual number could be higher because the survey was based on informal observations. A homeless person would not have been included, for example, if he or she was elsewhere when officials strolled by to scan the parks and train stations.",Dan Jarvis: Winter death toll should shame coldest of hearts,TRUE
0ee11c2b,"n a Capitol Hill hearing room two summers ago, privacy activist Christopher Soghoian organized a stunning demonstration of some new police surveillance technology. A small group of congressional staffers were handed ""clean"" cellphones and invited to start calling each other while, off to the side, a Berkeley communications researcher named Kurtis Heimerl turned on his gear. After a few minutes, Soghoian told the staffers to hang up—and then Heimerl played back their conversations. Not only that, the two men told the staffers, the digital eavesdropping equipment was capable of sucking all the data from their phones—emails, contact files, music, videos—whatever was on them. Since then, reports that federal, state and local law enforcement agencies are using such devices to track suspects and criminals without warrants have percolated in the national media, thanks largely to Soghoian, now the American Civil Liberties Union's top technologist on privacy issues. (A federal appeals court ruled June 11 that the Fourth Amendment protects people from such intrusions.) Far less well known is the use of such technology by foreign intelligence services against U.S. targets in Washington, D.C., sometimes using criminal go-betweens. It's a spy war that Q, James Bond's fictional techno-wizard, would envy. Instead of Walther PPK's and Aston Martins, the weapons are silent devices that capture cellphone signals. On one side are the world's major spy services, including those of China, Russia, Israel, France and now Iran. Arrayed against them are technical teams from the FBI and U.S. Secret Service, backed up by the NSA and the CIA. The bad guys may be winning this war, says Soghoian, a ponytailed, British-American former hacker with a Ph.D. from Indiana University. Intelligence officials worry that he's right, but won't say so publicly. And the feds don't want U.S. citizens to know about the technology, critics say, because they are shielding their use of similar devices, the most prominent of which is the StingRay. Spies With Big Ears Call it the ""IMSI catcher"" war, with the acronym standing for International Mobile Subscriber Identity. Every device that communicates with a cell tower—mobile phone, smartphone or tablet—has one. What StingRay (manufactured by Florida-based Harris Corp.) and its competitors do is act like a cellphone tower, drawing the unique IMSI signals into their grasp. Once the device is locked onto a signal, the quarry's data is ripe for the plucking. Major targets include people working for U.S. national security agencies, defense contractors and officials, including members of such congressional panels as the armed services and intelligence committees. ""This type of technology has been used in the past by foreign intelligence agencies here and abroad to target Americans, both [in the] U.S. government and corporations,"" former FBI deputy director Tim Murphy tells Newsweek. ""There's no doubt in my mind that they're using it."" Mike Janke, a former Navy SEAL and co-founder of Silent Circle, a company that sells state-of-the-art encryption software, says, ""Defense firms in the Washington, D.C. area have found IMSI catchers attached to the light poles in their parking lots. In February, one or two were found in the parking lot of a defense contractor near Washington."" He adds, ""They've also been found in Palo Alto,"" the capital of Silicon Valley. ""The FBI has been called in, but you can't track who has made it."" Keith Flannigan, who has worked for decades in law enforcement as a technical surveillance specialist, says high-tech criminal hackers, mostly in Europe, sell the information to interested parties, including spy services. Such transactions make it easier for the buyers to hide. ""That is why,"" he says of the many cases in which hacking has been detected, ""we don't know who the real ones are"" behind an electro-heist. ""They are smart enough to hire professionals to ensure that they don't get caught.""According to security experts, the main actors in electro-spying on U.S. targets are ""the big three""—China, Russia and Israel, the countries fingered by the CIA in a 2013 CIA National Intelligence Estimate on cyberthreats. Janke says Iran has also become a sophisticated player. According to a 2011 report in The Washington Post, Iran-backed Hezbollah used ""cellphone records and calling patterns"" to bust a CIA spy ring in Beirut.""It's a cat-and-mouse game,"" says Janke, a covert communications expert who ""has led and coordinated highly classified missions worldwide,"" according to Silent Circle's website. But it has ""tremendous implications,"" says James Bernazzani, who once headed the FBI's Hezbollah-tracking counterterrorism unit, partly because StingRay ""technology can defeat standard encryption."" To further complicate the electro-battlefield, there are also devices on the market that each side can use to detect when StingRays are aimed at them. ""Technological advances are most dangerous when the adversary puts 'the good guys' in a reactive and defensive position,"" Bernazzani told Newsweek. ""Technological advances need to stay ahead of those who wish us harm. That is critical."" As in all spy wars, street-level electro-espionage and counterespionage operations are largely invisible. In a rare exposure in 1998, a Russian diplomat was caught eavesdropping on the State Department's C Street headquarters. When the bust was announced, no mention was made of the technology involved, but a former CIA expert tells Newsweek the Russian was wearing ""a wired-up body vest"" that turned him into a walking, driving antenna nest. If stories like that conjure up black-and-white images of Nazi radio trucks cruising the dark streets of Paris in search of French Resistance agents, you're not far off, espionage veterans say. ""The tech officers [of foreign spy services] are always on the prowl for access points where [communications] can be secretly intercepted or sent, and that's why the opposition's tech officer's movements are of particular interest to [U.S. government] surveillance,"" the former CIA man says. ""It's rare that technical operations get exposed, since they're so carefully planned and executed."" The electro-war is ""3-D—in the air, underwater, in buildings, underground,"" the ex-spy explains. ""A tech team in a van may be targeting a U.S. official's cellphone inside a restaurant and turning on the microphone remotely. Or they may be tracking a target whose car has a beacon. ""Traditionally, the main base of…technical ops is from an embassy, consulate or military base,"" he adds. ""It's sovereign territory and safe.… The Russian Embassy, up on the hill overlooking Georgetown, has an ideal location to grab signals. Israel's embassy is next door to Intelsat,"" which operates over 50 communications satellites for U.S. and foreign clients. The Chinese Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico, has great electro-coverage of Southern California, according to the U.S. government's Intelligence Threat Handbook. It's Everywhere Now Thanks to Edward Snowden's snooping disclosures about the National Security Agency, we all know that the U.S. is listening too, mostly from the air-conditioned comfort of the NSA's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, or in American embassies. According to a recent piece by intelligence expert Matthew Aid in Foreign Policy magazine, the FBI attaches StingRay-like devices to helicopters and flies them over foreign embassies in Washington. That's a breeze compared with electro-spy vs. spy ops on the ground. ""Technical operations can get very complex and high-risk when it comes to involving the human factor and street work,"" the CIA veteran says. ""When case officers""—jargon for spy handlers—""join with tech officers and local agents, the intel wars take on a high-risk flavor."" Harris Corp. is no longer the sole source for IMSI catchers. Judging by the catalog of SafeTech, a Brazilian dealer in high-end police equipment, obtained by Newsweek, StingRays and associated equipment are easily available worldwide. (The company does not comment on its sales.) Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers have developed their own versions.
""There are several others [on the market],"" says Flannigan, director of International Dynamics Research Corp., a Virginia company that offers technical surveillance countermeasures training to private and government clients in the U.S. and abroad. ""There is a much better unit that is totally undetectable, that is good for about 1 ½ miles, that will record and resend all cell activity in that area."" One leading manufacturer is an Israeli company, Ability, which, according to its website, was ""founded in 1993 by a team of experts in military intelligence and communications, who were joined by specialists in electronics and mathematics…to devise state of the art encryption and decryption solutions…to security and intelligence agencies, military forces, police and homeland security services around the world."" ""The sword cuts both ways,"" says Murphy, who worked in technical, undercover and surveillance operations during his FBI career. ""As we advance in technology, the bad guys advance in technology, too. You're seeing that in the cyberwars.… The tools are easy to get ahold of. They're cheaper and faster, and the availability is widespread. So it wouldn't surprise me that adversarial, state-sponsored activity is going on and targeting our individuals, and at an exponential rate."" It's everywhere now, experts say. Stalkers have it. Private eyes have it. Tabloid reporters could have it (if they want to risk getting busted like Rupert Murdoch's British cellphone snoopers). Surely political ""opposition researchers"" have it. Nobody's iPhone or iPad is safe from the IMSI catchers.
In the wake of a 1996 incident in which a Florida couple ""accidentally"" eavesdropped on a conference call between key Republicans, including Newt Gingrich and future House Speaker John Boehner, federal legislation was passed to protect analog communications from interception. It didn't work. And obviously, the tech world has moved far beyond those primitive devices, privacy activists argue. In a paper to be published later this year in the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology, Soghoian and Stephanie K. Pell, a former federal prosecutor who served as counsel to the assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's National Security Division, argue that ""policy makers did not learn the right lessons from the analog cellular interception vulnerabilities of the '90s.… ""[The] communications of Americans will only be secured through the use of privacy enhancing technologies like encryption,"" they write, ""not with regulations prohibiting the use or sale of interception technology."" Try getting government officials to even talk about the need for higher encryption standards. ""In spite of the security threat posed by foreign government and criminal use of cellular interception technology,"" Soghoian and Pell write, ""U.S. government agencies continue to treat practically everything about it as a closely guarded 'source and method'""—jargon for intelligence tradecraft protected from public disclosure—""shrouding the technical capabilities, limitations and even the name of the equipment they use from public disclosure."" Indeed, the FBI, Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security all declined to comment on the security threat for Newsweek. A spokesman for the State Department said only, ""We provide briefings to our diplomats on the vulnerabilities of using cellphones and telephones while serving overseas,"" which includes reminders of ""the risks associated with revealing personal information via telephones or cellular phones."" The main feature of StingRays and the like is that one need not say anything on a cellphone to serve up valuable information. Once such devices suck data from your machine, they can find you (and your stored contacts) anywhere—even when your phone is turned off. U.S. law enforcement and spy agencies, which make extensive use of StingRays and countermeasures, refuse to talk about the security threat, especially in a public forum. Soghoian says that after his demonstration in the congressional hearing room two summers ago, ""the staff were pretty shocked…but nothing happened after. ""No hearings, no letters, nada.""",TEXAS RURAL HOSPITAL CLOSURES (1995-2015),TRUE
a5daf7ba,"It has been nearly three decades since the topic of global warming, and then climate change came on the scene as a hot (pardon the pun) topic on the pages and screens of our news media. Most people have taken sides as to whether or not humanity plays a role in determining the temperature of our planet. Whichever side you choose, it may not matter because the majority of the people will make the final decision. This decision making majority is not into the climate change debate for personal gains, political power, or social rewards. It is out of a genuine concern to do the right thing for humanity, their children, and all life on earth. Yet many are ambivalent, confused about the science or lack thereof to support one opinion or the other confidently. I believe that most are concerned with the least important factors rather than the most accurate answers. Let’s first establish that climate change is most definitely real. We all know that in the past, there were ice ages and wooly mammoths. We know about the heat of the dust bowl years of the 1930s pictured in the famous movie The Grapes of Wrath. Here I plan to give you the major vital factors that cause the climate to change. I choose to divide the controlling factors into four groups, leaving last those issues with which the reader is likely most familiar. The first group is related to the planetary orbit of the earth around the sun. The closer the earth is to the sun, the warmer it will be on earth. We learned in grade school that the earth is 93 million miles away, orbiting around it once a year. But this orbit is not always the same but is A very fresh look at climate change 1always changing. At times, the orbit is almost perfectly round; then, over thousands of years, it elongates and looks like a stretched out pancake, which we call an ellipse. Figure 1. About every 100,000 years, the sun makes a complete shift from this maximum elliptical shape when the earth goes as much as 120 million miles away to a near-perfect round shape. Then the earth is only 83 million miles away and it starts all over again, back to elliptical. This changing distance between the earth and the sun makes a big difference, which results in a change in our climate. Picture yourself at a campfire sitting 9 feet from the fire and then moving to a place 7 feet from the fire. That is the same ratio the earth experiences moving between 83 million miles and 120 million miles. The second factor that figures in the climate change story is the tilt of the earth relative to the sun. Presently this tilt is 23.7 degrees shown in Figure 2, but again things are always changing. The northern hemisphere of the earth will slowly tilt more towards the sun then slowly starts tilting back away from the sun. But after 40,000 years, it will be back to the tilt we see today. Within those 40,000 years, the tilt can range between 24.5 and 22.7 degrees. The tilt is significant as it determines winter, spring, summer, and fall and what their temperature ranges are likely to be. A very fresh look at climate changeThe third group of factors that impact the earth is contained within the sun itself. The sun undergoes very complicated and powerful magnetic cycles from high activity to low activity. It is easy to tell the difference from here on earth. When the activity is high, we see lots of spots on the sun. When we see few or even none, we know the activity levels are low, as can be solar radiation. Scientists have been carefully counting these spots for hundreds of years since Galileo got his first telescope. With satellites and advanced telescopes, NASA gets a count every day and also measures how big or small they are. As we see in Figure 3, scientists discovered without a question that these events go up and down in clear 11 year cycles. Believe it our not astronomers have recorded 24 such cycles in the past 250 years. Presently we are at the end of a cycle with near-zero sunspots. NASA has confirmed in recent years that increasing sunspots are linked to increases in earth temperature as well as the other planets, like Mars and Saturn, and even the moons. Essentially, none of the factors in these three groups are seriously considered in the alarmist views. They tell us that we are the primary forces controlling earth temperatures by the burning of fossil fuels and releasing their carbon dioxide. I hope my readers can recognize the absurdity of their claims. Now to the final group 4, the factors that logically and recognizably play a role in climate change. It is these variables that climate modelers try to use to create equations that supposedly tell us about how our climate will change for the coming decades. These factors are easy to understand but mostly impossible to predict. They include such things as the impact of clouds, the role of sea ice and glaciers, hurricanes and tornadoes, vegetation, the balance between the earth’s water, water vapor and ice, as well as the energy, flows between the oceans, the land, and the air. With these tools and methods, we can predict the weather for the next few days, maybe even weeks away. Surely they can’t predict the weather a year away, let alone decades into the future. I hope this short tutorial on the big climate change picture will make you more skeptical. After all, that’s the first responsibility of all real scientists, run experiments, gather data put together a theory then have as many experts try to shoot it down as best they can. The output of computer models is not data. Instead, these models are used to justify the nonsense they try to tell us that; life on earth will end in a dozen or so years along with their other ridiculous predictions for the future.",Charlie Crist disses idea of debate with Nan Rich,FALSE
7e341bd1,"Pennsylvania Republicans went after Democratic Senate hopeful Katie McGinty on Monday over a reported comment she made to a local paper that labeled voters outside of the state's large cities as ""misinformed."" Philadelphia's Jewish Exponent reported last Wednesday that McGinty ""has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the ‘T' part of the state,"" a geographic term that refers to the entire state outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and is known to be the home to the state's more conservative voters. Congressmen Joe Pitts (R., Pa.) wrote a letter to McGinty on Monday, six days after the article was published, that took issue with the comment and demanded an apology for her ""insult"" to ""millions of Pennsylvanians."" ""We are incredibly disappointed by your offensive statements about our great commonwealth in your recent Jewish Exponent interview, where you dismiss those of us who live outside of Philadelphia–an area you refer to as the ‘T'–as featuring ‘an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people,'"" wrote the letter from Pitts, which was co-signed by 17 other state politicians. Though McGinty had already promoted the story on her official Twitter account, her campaign contacted the Jewish Exponent after Republicans seized on the comment to get the paragraph removed, arguing that the comment was misattributed to McGinty and that she never said that. The McGinty campaign eventually got its way. The Jewish Exponent said that the remark about ""misinformed"" people in the article was based on interpretation and not a direct quote. ""While the Exponent’s interview of Katie McGinty did touch on the nature of the voting public in the rural parts of the state, a detailed analysis of our reporter’s recording and notes could not justify attributing to McGinty, even in paraphrase, assertions that were in the original story,"" said Joshua Runyan, the paper's editor-in-chief. ""For that reason, those assertions were removed in a subsequent version of the story online."" The article was initially changed on Monday afternoon to say that McGinty ""has found people in the ‘T' part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds are unaware of BDS' dangers,"" referring to an anti-Israel campaign to economically boycott the Jewish state. This was the original paragraph referring to the BDS campaign (emphasis added): ""It’s really so dangerous, so misdirected,"" said McGinty, who has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the ‘T' part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds. ""I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived."" It was changed to this: ""It’s really so dangerous, so misdirected,"" said McGinty, who has found people in the ""T"" part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds are unaware of BDS' dangers. ""I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived."" This was apparently insufficient. The paragraph, as it stands now, just plainly states the quote without any added comment: ""It's really so dangerous, so misdirected,"" said McGinty. ""I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived."" It is noted at the bottom of the article that it was updated ""to reflect the fact that statements earlier attributed to Katie McGinty regarding rural voters in Pennsylvania has been corrected."" A transcript of the interview provided by the Jewish Exponent shows that McGinty never exactly said that voters in the ""T"" were misinformed. The reporter asked, ""When you go out to some of those places in the T, as opposed to [in Philadelphia], what is their feeling of what’s going on [in Israel]?"" ""I think, well, I won’t speak for other people in terms of how much it—I guess I would say I think that needs to be more deeply, at a visceral level, understood by the people of this country,"" responded McGinty, after stating that she has always believed that ""Israel is an absolutely essential, vital partner and ally for the United States of America."" Republicans are not giving up on the attack, despite the correction. ""McGinty should apologize for calling millions of Pennsylvanians living outside Philadelphia ‘misinformed’ or simply release the audio of her interview if it was mischaracterized,"" said Ted Kwong, a spokesman for Republican Pat Toomey's reelection campaign in a Tuesday statement. The McGinty campaign denied a Washington Free Beacon request for it to share its audio recording of the interview and is choosing not to engage Republicans on the issue. ""The Jewish Exponent has issued a correction and noted that comments included in the initial story were unfortunately misattributed Katie,"" campaign spokesman Sabrina Singh told the Free Beacon. The Toomey campaign is asking why it took so long for McGinty to take issue with the Jewish Exponent misrepresenting her words. ""After proudly sharing the article on social media, why did it take a letter from elected officials across the Commonwealth, and three whole days for McGinty to decide she actually didn't intend to insult the millions of Pennsylvanians that live outside of her hometown of Philadelphia?"" said Kwong. Republicans are using the issue to pivot back to the 2008 comment by President Barack Obama, who endorsed McGinty last week, who said that that Pennsylvanians ""cling to guns or religion."" They are also using it to portray McGinty as out of touch with the majority of the state. ""We recognize that your career in Washington, D.C., and in Gov. Wolf’s administration, as well as your experience on various corporate energy boards, might not have adequately exposed you to the rest of our commonwealth,"" wrote Republican lawmakers in their letter to McGinty. ""In light of your unfortunate assessment, it is clear that you have much to learn about the majority of Pennsylvanians who live outside of Philadelphia.""",McGinty Disputes GOP Charge She Called Rural Voters 'Misinformed',FALSE
c6e6f933,"During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday. The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.” After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee. The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired. The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.",United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight,FALSE
d7660e21,"by Sen. Doug Whitsett More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly. Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms. A few of the more aggressive bills included: • House Bill 3200 that would have created the crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. • House Bill 3413 that would have created the crime of endangering a minor, by allowing the minor access to a fire arm, punishable by up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. • SB 347 that would have allowed each school district to establish their own rules regarding the right to carry a licensed concealed weapon on school property. Violation of the law would have constituted criminal trespass, resulting in penalties of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. This bill would also have preempted the current law that only allows the legislative body to create laws regulating firearms. • SB 699 that would have restricted the right to carry a concealed weapon in the capitol building by most licensed people without the written permission of the legislative administration. • SB 700 that would have required completion of a background check, before any firearm could be transferred between private parties. Failure to complete the background check could have resulted in penalties up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $125,000, or both. • SB 758 that would have required the owner of a firearm to carry specific liability insurance on each firearm in their possession. It also made it a crime to transfer a firearm to another person unless that individual carried liability insurance on the weapon. Failure to maintain liability insurance on each firearm would have resulted in fines of up to $10,000 per firearm. • SB 796 that would have required completion of a concealed handgun course, including a live fire test, before a concealed handgun license could be issued. It is unclear why our legislature should focus its attention on increasing the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. It seems that no one can remember the last time that an Oregon handgun licensee committed a crime with a firearm. Each of these bills, except HB 3413, had an emergency clause attached. The only reason for the emergency clause would have been to prevent the bill from being referred to the people to decide. None of these bills were enacted into Oregon law. The primary reason that the bills did not pass was because the Senate Leadership knew that the combined 15 no votes of 14 Senate Republicans, and of Senator Betsy Johnson, would have defeated each of the bills on the Senate floor. For that reason, they were never allowed to come to the Senate floor for a vote. From my perspective, that vote count is much too close for comfort. Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights. Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent. Unintended deaths by firearms have dropped by nearly 60 percent since 1993, and have decreased by more than 80 percent since 1929. This dramatic decline in the number of crimes committed with firearms has occurred during the same time period when our national population has increased from 250 million to 315 million people. During the same twenty years, more than 100 million guns have been sold to private citizens in the United States. Forty three percent of U.S homes now report that they possess one or more firearms. I would imagine that the gun owning percentage is actually much higher than reported, because many people who own firearms do not prefer to let anyone know that they have those weapons. All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns. Nonetheless, gun violence is the third most often reported event by our news media. That rate of reporting is only surpassed by news reports on traffic and the weather. The media almost never reports the daily events where violence is prevented by an armed citizen. It is this constant media bias that is primarily responsible for people believing that gun violence is on the increase. In my opinion, our most important right, as citizens of the United States, is our constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment right to own and bear firearms. Throughout recorded history, each and every would-be dictator and despot has first convinced the people to disarm, allegedly in order to make their society a safer and more peaceful place to live. Once they have given up their firearms they have been systematically stripped of all other human rights. We must not allow glib-speaking politicians, and a complicit news media, to convince us that we are safer without firearms. We are not safer. We are defenseless.

47132202,"Within the open greenery of Central Park, a 68-bed field hospital has been erected to care for patients battling COVID-19. The outdoor facility — which will be staffed by 60 to 70 medical professionals — is being led by Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization run by Franklin Graham, son of the Rev. Billy Graham. While the organization has been applauded for delivering an overflow hospital for Mount Sinai’s overcrowded Manhattan facilities in a matter of days, it has raised eyebrows because of a public request for “Christian” volunteers and a policy that volunteers adhere to its 11-point Statement of Faith. If you are a Christian doctor, nurse, paramedic, or other medical professional interested in serving COVID-19 patients in our @SamaritansPurse Emergency Field Hospital in NYC, please visit https://t.co/EEw1jNtrrk. pic.twitter.com/5i7EeKxLDi — Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) March 29, 2020 Ten of the 11 items pertain broadly to doctrinal issues, including one that “human life is sacred from conception to its natural end,” but only one singles out a class of people. “We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other,” item nine of the Statement of Faith reads. “God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female.” On Monday, New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman called upon Graham “to publicly assure LGBTQ New Yorkers that they will receive the same treatment as anyone else at the Central Park field hospital.” In a statement emailed to NBC News, Graham said, “Samaritan’s Purse treats everyone we help the same.” “We do not make distinctions about an individual’s religion, race, sexual orientation, or economic status. We certainly do not discriminate, and we have a decades-long track record that confirms just that,” Graham stated. “This is a time for all of us to unite and work together, regardless of our political views. Let’s support one another during this crisis, and we pray that God will bless the efforts of all those battling this vicious virus.” Samaritan’s Purse did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment about Graham’s public call for “Christian” medical professionals to volunteer at the field hospital. Hoylman told NBC News that it’s “a shame that the federal government has left us in the position of having to accept charity from such bigots.” “This health crisis is too delicate to leave it to televangelists, purveyors of the faith, to handle our medical needs,” Hoylman, who is gay, said. “This is a man, after all, who has said that the LGBTQ community recruits children, he’s said that families like mine are invalid, he compares the transgender community to pedophiles and perverts, so I think it would behoove us to watch him and his followers’ actions extremely closely.” New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson issued a statement on Tuesday calling it ""extremely disturbing"" that Graham and his group were involved in relief efforts. Johnson warned that he would be ""monitoring the situation closely and making sure that our city's values are being represented at all times."" Franklin Graham, the relief organization’s president and CEO, has a long history of anti-LGBTQ beliefs and remarks. In a 2014 video interview published by The Charlotte Observer, Graham accused gays of “recruiting children” into their “cause”; applauded Russian President Vladimir Putin’s so-called gay propaganda law as a method of “protecting his nation’s children”; and accused the Obama administration of pushing a “gay and lesbian agenda.” That same year, at a conference hosted by the Family Research Council, Graham said he’s “not afraid of homosexuals.” On the contrary, he said, “I love them” — “I love them enough to care to warn them that if they want to continue living like this, it’s the flames of hell for you.” Following the 2017 repeal of North Carolina’s transgender ""bathroom bill,"" which banned trans people from using restrooms matching their gender identity, Graham tweeted, “Thanks to the gov, people of NC will be exposed to pedophiles & sexually perverted men in women’s public restrooms.” And just last year, Graham denounced the sexuality of former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg, saying the Bible defines homosexuality as “something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized.” Earlier this year, eight places in the United Kingdom that Graham had reserved for an upcoming tour canceled his appearance over his stances on LGBTQ issues. One of the venues, ACC Liverpool in England, said it had canceled because of a “number of statements which we consider to be incompatible with our values.” An interview request to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene did not receive an immediate response. However, in an interview with Gothamist, the New York City Mayor’s Office said Samaritan’s Purse will operate as a Mount Sinai Health System facility and therefore must adhere to the hospital’s antidiscrimination policy, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, among other characteristics.

16ce44aa,"Republican State Senator and candidate for governor, Michael Williams, announced his opposition to regulating or banning bump stocks. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms determined in a 2015 memo that bump stocks are not mechanical, therefore they do not fall under the machine gun weapons ban of 1986. An attack on bump stocks is an attack on the Second Amendment. In solidarity with gun owners across the nation, Michael Williams is giving away a free bump stock to one lucky winner. Williams said, “The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians. In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence. Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control. There is zero evidence that banning bump stocks would prevent any gun violence deaths. Georgia’s gun owners deserve a governor who will stand with them when liberals and Hollywood elites attack our fundamental rights. That’s why I am standing for the second amendment and giving away a bump stock as a show of support.” “If politicians wanted to have a real conversation on reducing gun violence, they would be discussing mental health awareness, and ways to reduce the weekly bloodbath in Chicago and other inner cities. You cannot regulate evil out of existence. Blaming guns or bump stocks for the actions of a lunatic, is the same as blaming McDonald’s for heart disease,” continued Williams. “I will stand up for the Second Amendment against liberals and weak Republicans who wish to limit our freedoms. Not only that, I will continue to call out Democrats and Republicans who provide cheap talk and excuses rather than solutions.” ### BUMP STOCK GIVEAWAY LINK https://williamsgeorgia.com/bump-stock-giveaway/",These gender-neutral schools want to crush stereotypes,FALSE
bfcfac7d,"We all need to keep in mind that, except for a handful of pollsters, polling is irretrievably broken. So, with a grain of salt and a big, broad smile across my face, I am happy to pass along this CNBC/Change Research poll that shows only three percent — a mere three percent, of President Donald Trump’s supporters see former Vice President Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election. Alternately, far-left CNBC reports that a “staggering 73% of respondents consider Trump the legitimate winner. Another 24% said they are not sure.” Staggering. LOL. Only three percent of “Trump voters believe he should concede to Biden and start the peaceful transfer of power. Another 31% want the president to fight in court until states certify results. Two-thirds, or 66%, think Trump should never concede.” Never concede. LOL. The CNBC write-up contains a number of lies about Trump’s efforts to contest the election and ensure every legal vote is counted. “[T]he poll underscores the potentially bigger harm Trump’s lies about the vote tallies have done to public faith in the electoral process,” CNBC writes without evidence. “The president appears to have convinced many of his supporters he lost unfairly, even as state officials and judges have repeatedly shot down claims of fraud and wrongdoing,” CNBC again says without evidence. The truth is Trump’s legal team has not yet presented what they say is evidence of widespread fraud, enough fraud to overturn the election results. We are only 21 days past the election. Al Gore spent 38 days contesting the 2000 presidential election. Trump has every legal, constitutional, and moral right to ensure the November 3 election was not rigged. Let’s never forget that four blue counties in four swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan — all stopped counting voted on the night of the election. This is unprecedented and has still not been explain. Before the vote counting stopped, Trump looked like he was on his way to reelection. After the vote counting restarted Will you look at all those Biden votes!I’ve been watching national election late into the night since 1984 — presidential and midterm elections. I have never before seen a state stop counting. With… the poll gets even better… A “vast majority of Trump voters — 81% — said they would not give Biden a chance as president. Only 19% said they would.” Never give Biden a chance. LOL. Why should Trump supporters give His Fraudulency a chance as president when Democrats and the corporate media didn’t give Trump a chance as president, when the Obama/Biden administration repeatedly broke the law with illegal leaks, fraudulent warrants, and illegal unmasking to spy on the Trump campaign and undermine his presidency? And why would we give a chance to a racist like Biden, a credibly-accused rapist and serial liar determined to take away our guns, our free speech rights, wage more pointless wars, raise our taxes, and lock us down for no reason? CNBC claims it polled “1,203 people who voted for Trump in 2020 nationwide from Wednesday to Saturday” with a “margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.” Who knows what CNBC really did. Like NBC does with the news, CNBC might have just fabricated this poll out of thin air so they would have a headline. Still, though, LOL.

6bb4fea4,"Thank you to Universities UK UUK for hosting us today. In my first speech on universities a month ago, I addressed the subject of international education. I am proud of the sector’s international standing and reputation around the world. Today, I want to reflect further on what underpins this excellence, and what more we can do to enhance it. At the root of that success is the autonomy and academic freedom that enables us to attract brilliant people to work in and run our universities and lead our sectoral bodies. I’d like to congratulate Nicola Dandridge for her recent CBE and thank outgoing UUK President, Chris Snowden, for his excellent service. I would also like to congratulate Dame Julia Goodfellow on taking over the UUK Presidency – the first woman to hold the post ever, I believe in around 100 years of the existence of UUK and its predecessor body. Success of the sector The higher education sector can be proud of its success over the last 5 years and I want to pay tribute to my colleagues David Willetts and Greg Clark for their part in the reforms that have helped sustain the high esteem in which it is held around the world. We have seen: a transformed financial situation; as the OECD says, we are one of the only countries in the world to have found a way of sustainably funding higher education we have seen record numbers of young people entering higher education, including record numbers from disadvantaged backgrounds and we have seen record numbers of graduates in work; the recent Graduate Labour Market statistics showed the highest employment rate for working age graduates since 2007 at 87.5% through all this, the UK has retained its place as a world leader in HE , with 4 universities in the global top 10, and as number one in the world for the impact of our research Unfinished business It’s a great success story, but there is unfinished business and, in the coming months, my focus will be on implementing 3 key manifesto pledges, so that we consolidate and build on these achievements: firstly, lifting the cap on student numbers and widening participation, so that we remove barriers to ambition and meet the PM’s commitment to double the proportion of disadvantaged young people entering higher education by 2020 from 2009 levels secondly, delivering a teaching excellence framework that creates incentives for universities to devote as much attention to the quality of teaching as fee-paying students and prospective employers have a right to expect thirdly, driving value for money both for students investing in their education, and taxpayers underwriting the system, so that we ensure the continuing success and stability of these reforms Taking these points in reverse order. Meeting value for money expectations Around now, the first cohort of students to enter under the 2012 reforms is preparing to enter the labour market. They have been working hard for their final exams and made a significant investment in higher education. They are looking critically at what they get for that investment, and so must we, as a government, on behalf of taxpayers. I am concerned that recent surveys – the HEPI-HEA Student Academic Experience Survey, as well as a BBC/ComRes poll – showed that only around half of students felt their course had provided good value for money. All of us need to reflect on this and on what we can do to address such unease. More informed choices Thanks to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act passed in March, we can now start to assess the employment and earnings returns to education by matching Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS and Department for Education DfE education data with HMRC employment and income data and Department for Work and Pensions DWP benefits data. Information of this sort will be incredibly useful for young people choosing courses or jobs that are most suitable for them. It will also enable education providers to assess their effectiveness in delivering positive labour market outcomes for their students. I am also pleased to see the piloting of new National Student Survey questions that measure the engagement of students with their course, staff and fellow students. This was shown in the US to be a good proxy for the value add of a university in terms of ‘learning gain’ - the improvement in knowledge, skills and work-readiness that students demonstrate over time. While independent learning is vital, universities must get used to providing clearer information about how many hours students will spend in lectures, seminars and tutorials, and who will deliver the teaching. Indeed the Competition and Markets Authority have advised higher education providers that information should be available to prospective students to meet the requirements of consumer law. I know this is already on the sector’s agenda. I will continue to push for more data to be made available, including for alternative providers. A Higher Education Policy Institute Hepi survey suggests as many as three-quarters of undergraduates want more information about where their fees go – and I sympathise with that. Such transparency looks to me like an essential way of addressing value for money concerns. More competition More competition will also be central to our efforts to drive up standards. In the last 3 years, we have seen more universities created than at any time since the 1992 expansion. We are committed to promoting high quality market entry, whilst at the same time ensuring a regulatory regime which guards against poor quality provision. More competition and more informed choice will help drive up value for money for both students and taxpayers. Graduate premium The graduate earnings premium is an important measure of the value universities add and of the greater productivity of those with skills acquired in higher education. Of course, many graduates will consciously choose to go into occupations that do not maximise their incomes – we must remember that education is about more than just wage returns. Indeed, that is the reason we have a progressive repayment system for student loans. But it is also important to remember that higher lifetime graduate earnings provide benefits to society – including higher tax revenues and faster and fuller repayment of student loans. Evidence of a decline in the graduate earnings premium is therefore a concern as we look to drive up productivity in the economy, secure our public finances and ensure our higher education system continues to be funded in a sustainable way. Between 2006 and 2015, the graduate earnings premium decreased from around 55% higher to around 45% higher than the earnings of non-graduates, with graduates now earning on average £31k and non-graduates £22,000. There is still a considerable benefit – but we cannot be complacent and must analyse why the premium employers pay for graduates is falling at a time when graduate-level skills are in growing demand. Course choice and curriculum design An important part of the answer is that we are not yet rising to the challenge of ensuring that enough young people are choosing courses where there are skills shortages and strong employer demand – notably in science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM . Nor are we doing enough to ensure that all students emerge from university prepared for work. Last year’s CBI /Pearson Education and Skills survey suggested that 47% of employers felt universities should do more to help students become job-ready. Government, business and the university sector need to come together to address this mismatch between supply and demand in the graduate labour market. Businesses should not just be seen as customers of universities, recruiting the graduates they educate or buying research expertise, but as active partners. Universities need to develop business-outreach into a core function that has influence over curriculum design. Closer partnership between universities and business will help us tackle the misguided view that ‘more means worse’ and ensure that the investment both students and taxpayers make in higher education provides visible returns. Teaching Excellence Framework TEF Above all, to meet students’ high expectations of their university years and to deliver the skills our economy needs, we need a renewed focus on teaching. This is vital unfinished business from the reforms of the last Parliament. As David Willetts himself acknowledged in a recent interview with the Times Higher Education; “teaching has been by far the weakest aspect of English higher education”. This must change. There must be recognition of excellent teaching – and clear incentives to make ‘good’ teaching even better. Some rebalancing of the pull between teaching and research is undoubtedly required. It is striking that while we have a set of measures to reward high quality research, backed by substantial funding the Research Excellence Framework, there is nothing equivalent to drive up standards in teaching. That is why my priority as Universities Minister will be to make sure students get the teaching they deserve and employers get graduates with the skills they need by introducing the Teaching Excellence Framework we promised in our manifesto. Aims for the TEF My aims for the TEF are: to ensure all students receive an excellent teaching experience that encourages original thinking, drives up engagement and prepares them for the world of work to build a culture where teaching has equal status with research, with great teachers enjoying the same professional recognition and opportunities for career and pay progression as great researchers to stimulate a diverse HE market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating to recognise those institutions that do the most to welcome students from a range of backgrounds and support their retention and progression to further study or a graduate job I expect the TEF to include a clear set of outcome-focused criteria and metrics. This should be underpinned by an external assessment process undertaken by an independent quality body from within the existing landscape. Believe me, I have no intention of replicating the individual and institutional burdens of the REF . I am clear that any external review must be proportionate and light touch, not big, bossy and bureaucratic. I want to work with you all, as well as with the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Quality Assurance Agency, to design a framework that has widespread support and works for the sector, as well as students and employers and taxpayers. This is not happening in isolation. It goes with the grain of our reforms since 2010 and aims to accelerate positive changes already underway in the sector. We will be consulting widely and I am not pre-empting what any of the incentives might look like. I am keen to hear your views ahead of a green paper, which the Department of Business, Innovation and SkiIls plans to publish in the autumn. Maintaining the value of our degrees One of the things I want to focus on in the green paper is how the TEF can help improve the information that matters most for graduates and employers: the degree classification. Here we face a significant challenge. The UK’s standard model of classes of honours is on its own no longer capable of providing the recognition hardworking students deserve and the information employers require. Students across the country have just finished their exams and are looking for good graduate jobs. Last week’s High Fliers survey reminded us that the class of 2015 is more career-oriented than ever before. They rightly want hard work at university to be recognised and for their degree to be a currency that carries prestige and holds its value. At the same time, businesses need a degree classification system that will help them identify the best applicants for their firms. I know the sector is starting to tackle this need for richer information through the Higher Education Achievement Report and this is a valuable development, but this work needs greater urgency. Let me explain why: There has been a significant increase in the proportion of people receiving firsts and 2:1 degrees. To the extent this expansion in the number of firsts and 2:1s is to do with rising levels of attainment and hard work, I applaud it. But I suspect I am not alone in worrying that less benign forces are at work with the potential to damage the UK higher education brand. On the face of it, the facts are certainly startling. There has been a 300% increase in the percentage of firsts since the 1990s. Over 70% of graduates now get a First or 2:1 – up by 7 percentage points in the past 5 years. And compared to just 47% in the mid-1990s. In 2013 to 14, over 50% of students were awarded an upper second, suggesting that this grade band not only disguises considerable variation in attainment, but also permits some to coast. The Higher Education Academy found that nearly half of institutions had changed their degree algorithms to; “ensure that their students were not disadvantaged compared to those in other institutions”. The Teaching Excellence Framework we will introduce will include incentives for the sector to tackle degree inflation and ensure that hard-won qualifications hold their value. I want the green paper to look at the role that external examiners play in underpinning standards and ensuring our grading system provides a clearer, more comparable picture of student attainment. Stronger student engagement I also want to make sure that the Teaching Excellence Framework encourages universities to adopt a grading system that does more to motivate and engage students throughout their course. The familiar pattern of a First, 2:1 and 2:2, Third is widely recognised. But providing extra granularity through a grade point average GPA – a 13 point scale developed by the sector – will encourage consistent effort, make it less easy to coast within the 2:1 band and give employers more information about candidates within that classification. It is vital that we continue to drive up student engagement. Students are working harder than before and that is a welcome trend, which we want to support through the Teaching Excellence Framework. But many full time students are still not being sufficiently stretched. In the most recent Student Academic Experience Survey, the total weekly workload reported by students averages 30.5 hours, including 14 hours of independent study, and varies greatly by subject. The reported weekly workload on courses such as Mass Communications and Documentation is as little as 22 hours. Students are telling us in surveys that they know they would do better by investing more time in their studies. As a more finely-calibrated long-run batting average, GPA should drive greater student engagement than our present system, which, notwithstanding more summative coursework, in many ways can still look like a snapshot performance measure. I know Sir Robert Burgess, chair of the Grade Point Average Advisory Group, has predicted all UK universities will adopt the model by the end of the decade. I support this goal and want the green paper to examine how the new Teaching Excellence Framework can encourage universities to adopt dual running of the GPA and honours degree system, as recommended in the recent Higher Education Academy report. Widening participation My focus has of course been on students and the job market. But this does not mean we overlook the value of learning for its own sake, or the role of higher education in social mobility. The 2012 reforms mean that anyone with the ability can now make going to university their goal, a fact underscored by our decision to lift the cap on student numbers altogether from this academic year. Anyone with potential to benefit from university should not be prevented from going because of their background or ability to pay. But of course there is still more to do. The Prime Minister has set an ambitious goal to double the proportion of those from disadvantaged backgrounds progressing into higher education by 2020 compared with 2009. I will challenge you to do all you can to reach this target. That’s why I am delighted that Professor Les Ebdon has agreed to extend his term as director of the Office of Fair Access to help us fulfil a commitment that is central to this One Nation Government’s aim to promote social mobility in this country. In particular, I want to see more progress being made in the most selective institutions. Data from UCAS shows the clear progress that the sector has made, and I applaud that. I want to see more outreach and more innovation in terms of course length and design. Degree Apprenticeships and 2-year courses in particular offer a more accessible route to a higher education and a faster path to productive employment. We also need to match our efforts on driving up fair access by also ensuring those young people succeed in getting a good qualification and have an opportunity to find a fulfilling career. I know that this ‘whole student lifecycle’ approach is one that you are taking seriously – and it is embedded in the National Strategy for Access and Student Success. I expect our new Teaching Excellence Framework to include incentives that reward institutions who do best at retention and progression of disadvantaged students through their college years. Conclusion I recognise that this is a challenging agenda and that you are already focused on many of these issues. We will be working with closely with universities and with the grain of reforms that have put power and choice in the hands of students. Those institutions that can demonstrate that they excel in teaching and in supporting all students – including those from disadvantaged backgrounds – through university into graduate jobs will reap rewards. If we can get this right – on driving value for money for students and taxpayers on creating incentives to encourage excellent teaching and on widening participation – then I’m confident we can together make a world-leading higher education sector greater still.",USCIS Announces Final Rule Enforcing Long-Standing Public Charge Inadmissibility Law,TRUE

Nearly half of voters 46% think Britain's economy would be weaker if the Labour leader replaced her in Downing Street while 43% think she is the right person for the job, according to the ComRes State-of-the-Nation poll for the Daily Express. And the Tories do not appear to have suffered any loss of popularity from the Windrush scandal that forced Amber Rudd to quit as Home Secretary earlier this week, the research shows. Labour and the Tories are level-pegging at 40% each in the poll, virtually unchanged from a previous survey before the scandal about the immigration status of Caribbean migrants and their descendants erupted. The poll findings are likely to cheer the Prime Minister and her team ahead of town hall elections in England on Thursday, the first electoral test for her Government since last year's general election. Theresa May's most powerful quotes Thu, August 31, 2017 Play slideshow Getty Images 1 of 8 'I will be ruthless in cutting out waste, streamlining structures and improving efficiency' With the Remainers becoming so intransigent, the Prime Minister may need to call their bluff by going to the country Minister Designed to give a snapshot of the nation's mood ahead of the local vote, the poll also found voters are upbeat about modern Britain and take particular pride in the country's Royal Family and NHS. Andrew Hawkins, ComRes Chairman, said: “That the two main parties are polling neck and neck despite Theresa May’s considerable lead over Jeremy Corbyn on economic management points either to voters being prepared to support a party that they believe will them poorer, or at election time they will instead opt for what they feel is the safer option. The danger for Labour is not just that there is a discrepancy, it is the scale of it, including among young people whose support is vital if the Party is to stand a chance of winning an election. The ComRes survey of more than 2,000 voters, conducted online last weekend, showed 47% of voters think international confidence in Britain's economy is stronger with Mrs May as Prime Minister than it would be under Mr Corbyn. Only 30% disagreed with the statement. GETTY The poll found that Brits take particular pride in the country's Royal Family It also found that Tory support was unchanged at 40% since a previous poll by the firm published in the Sunday Express on 13 April. Labour support was down by one point to 40% while the Lib Dems were up two points to 9%. Labour's failure to capitalise on the Government's recent rocky patch has led to a growing confidence in Tory ranks. Senior Conservatives believe Mr Corbyn's own troubles over allegations of anti-Semitism in his party and his refusal to back robust action against Russia and Syria is damaging his populist appeal. Some Brexit ministers are even understood to be pressing Theresa May to signal her readiness to call a snap general election as a threat to bring Brexit rebels into line. One minister told the Daily Express: With the Remainers becoming so intransigent, the Prime Minister may need to call their bluff by going to the country. The minister added: She may need to call a Brexit election to settle this once and for all. We need to make life uncomfortable for Remain-backing MPs who represent constituencies that voted leave. Labour would be slaughtered in its northern heartlands if the party backed staying in the customs union. It would be a complete betrayal of the referendum. GETTY 47% of voters think international confidence in UK's economy would be weaker under Jeremy Corbyn Other Tories were less enthusiastic about the election plan however. One senior backbencher said: An election now would be stupid. It didn't work last year and wouldn't work now. Mrs May tomorrow convenes a meeting of her Brexit sub-committee to discuss whether a controversial blueprint for a customs partnership should become the Government's preferred option in the negotiations with Brussels. Ministers are bitterly divided over the issue, with Brexit enthusiasts fearing the plan is an attempt to keep Britain tied into the customs union forever. One Whitehall source said: The committee is split down the middle and the decision could come down to a show of hands.

863897d7,"Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

Read our privacy notice But one Conservative backbencher has warned the Prime Minister of a growing revolt, urging her to “honour” the verdict delivered by the tribunal. In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home.","Dr. Didier Raoult published new results of 1,061 coronavirus patients treated using hdroxychloroquine with 91% success rate.

He rips up problematic streets, raises them with extra dirt and repaves them, installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay. The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods. A controversy has erupted about whether Miami Beach is polluting Biscayne Bay with the water, but the city is pushing ahead. Miami Beach plans to spend at least $400 million on its plan by 2018, raising the money through fees imposed on homes and businesses. The huge county government for the region, Miami-Dade County, is developing its own resilience strategy, one likely to cost billions. It has committed to rebuilding some of its decaying infrastructure, like a sewage plant, in a way that safeguards against sea-level rise and storm surges. “I don’t see doom and gloom here; I see opportunity,” said Harvey Ruvin, the clerk of courts for Miami-Dade County, who has been a leading voice on the environment in Florida for a half-century, and who recently led a county task force on sea-level rise. “We’re talking about the most robust possible jobs program you can think of, and one that can’t be outsourced.” Many of the Republican mayors in the region are on the same page as Democrats in requesting national and state action on climate change, as well as pushing local steps. James C. Cason, the Republican mayor of Coral Gables, has convened informational sessions that draw hundreds of residents, and he has received no complaints for his stance. “I hope in coming years when we have to spend a lot of money, the citizens will still support it,” Mr. Cason said in an interview.

In 2010, some 2.2 million of Britain’s 28.2 million employees were migrants with just 1.1 million coming from Europe. By last year, 3.4 million from a workforce of 30.3 million were born abroad, with 2.2 million arriving from the EU bloc and 1.2 million from the rest of the world. Anti-EU critics said years of Britain’s “open borders” policy was behind the rapid rise and the reason voters chose Leave at last year’s referendum. Independent MEP Steven Woolfe said: “These figures are a portrayal of long-term, mass uncontrolled migration from the EU. As members we’ve had no control over who comes to work but this will end once we leave now Theresa May has committed us to leaving the single market. “Relying on foreign labour is unsustainable and is no longer mandated by the British public, the majority of whom want to decrease immigration.” GETTY - STOCK IMAGE The 'open borders' policy has seen the number of foreign workers double in six years What countries are in the EU?

A further 669,000 migrants worked in jobs such as selling or cleaning, including 510,000 EU nationals. Eight per cent of workers in manufacturing came from eight European countries – the EU8 – which joined the EU in 2004. GETTY Steven Woolfe said that relying on foreign labour is 'no longer sustainable' These are Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Workers from the EU as a whole made up 11 per cent of the sector. Seven per cent of those working in agriculture, forestry and fishing came from the same eight EU countries. One in eight in the financial and business services sector was foreign, including 382,000 from the EU. Ukip home affairs spokeswoman Jane Collins said: “The figures are a damning indictment of open door migration and its downward pressure on wages. “Wealthy Remainers love the EU because it turns the minimum wage into the maximum wage and gives power to large businesses who can afford lobbyists in Brussels. “But what a population increase on this unprecedented scale does is lower wages while having an upward inflationary pressure on housing, services, food and other goods.” Some 701,000 non-UK nationals work in public administration, education and health care, more than a quarter of them from the EU.

45525605,"The NHS has spent almost £1bn giving 74,000 cancer patients drugs rejected by the medicines regulator but does not know if they have extended their lives, the National Audit Office has said. In a new report released on Thursday, the NAO castigated the NHS and Department of Health’s failure to collect data on the outcomes experienced by patients helped by the Cancer Drugs Fund as a major weakness. Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, said the NHS and the Department of Health’s failure to ensure data collation “makes no sense” and made it impossible to judge if the scheme had succeeded in extending patients’ survival. The budgets of other NHS services have also suffered as a result of spending sums as large as £416m a year on the fund, the public spending watchdog found. The fund, set up by the coalition government in 2010, has improved access to more than 40 cancer drugs not usually available on the NHS which might enhance survival, the NAO said. Most recipients had a terminal form of the disease. It has approved requests for more than 74,000 patients since its creation, when some doctors saw it as compromising the role and judgment of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Nice. Between 2013 and 2015, 51% of those patients received drugs that Nice had assessed but not recommended for routine use either because it did not deem them worthwhile on grounds of cost or clinical effectiveness, or both. Their receipt meant that England increased the use of new cancer drugs relative to other comparable countries, although did not close the gap. The other 49% got drugs that Nice was examining at the time or which had not yet been appraised. While some patients have received drugs costing less than £10,000, others got medication costing more than £100,000. Initially the fund underspent its budget by 28%. But recently it has overshot it and is likely to spend £70m more than planned in 2015-16, the NAO said. “Taking 2013-14 and 2014-15 together, NHS England overspent the allocated budget for the fund by 35%. The overspend meant that less money was available for other services,” the NAO’s report on its investigation into the fund says. Hillier said that “at a time of increased pressures on NHS funding, the cancer drugs fund is not sustainable in its current form. There needs to be much better control of costs and proper assessment of whether these drugs are making a difference to the health of patients.” Spiralling costs prompted NHS England to axe 16 drugs from the list of medicines the fund would pay for in March, followed by another dozen earlier this month. Cancer charities warned that the withdrawals would mean that some patients died. It is consulting on replacing the fund with a much cheaper “managed access fund” that would cover the costs of promising new cancer drugs for a set period while Nice decided if they represented value for money or not. Lady Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: “It’s been clear for some time now that it no longer works. This report just confirms for us what we already knew.“The government, the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry have overpromised to those that depend on them and, by failing to agree on realistic prices for new drugs, the simple fact is that people will die sooner from breast and other cancers.” Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, said the scaling back of the fund represented a broken promise by the Conservatives, who had pledged to continue investing if re-elected in May. She said: “The Tories promised to fix the broken system for funding cancer medicines in the last parliament, but failed to do so. Now they are having to remove drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund, breaking one of David Cameron’s key election pledges to cancer patients.” The Department of Health said it remained committed to the fund.",Khrushchev tours America: 'No sour cabbage soup for these people',partially false

9d41b6e2,"National Report Casey Anthony, the woman famously acquitted in 2011 of murdering her daughter Caylee, is confirmed to be pregnant again. This time with twins.
Previous reports on Anthony’s lifestyle in the three years since she was released from prison have described her as being withdrawn, and living like a hermit. Anthony filed for bankruptcy in 2013, claiming to be unemployed and possessing no source of income. She met with agents and publishers in New York last year, hoping to cash in on her notoriety by writing a book but was unable to close a deal. Casey currently appears to live off of a few benefactors who reportedly pay for all of her living expenses. But the days of needing to live off of others may soon be coming to a close for Anthony.
Casey’s New York agent, Jeremy Nieven, confirms that she is indeed four months pregnant with twins, and that she has signed a contract for an initial six episode reality television series that will showcase her pregnancy and subsequently her babies. “She wants to redeem herself in the eyes of America”, stated Nieven. “Did she make mistakes? Absolutely! But this is the U.S.A., everyone can get a second chance here. And let’s not forget that Casey was found innocent of the charges against her. She was released. She is a free woman now, and this show is going to allow her to make a great life for her new little angels.” But can people forget Casey Anthony’s actions? Many critics have claimed that Anthony’s acquittal resulted from a flawed prosecution, not from an actual lack of guilt. Can America forget that this woman partied it up at the clubs while hiding the fact that her two-year old daughter decomposed in the woods close to her family home? Can they forget the lies, the evasions and distortions that so easily came from her mouth? Apparently television executives say yes. Her notoriety translates to interest, and interest can translate to ratings. Casey’s agent refused to disclose the name of the network that had contracted with her for the reality series, saying that a press release was scheduled in September to break the show. Nieven did confirm that the show would be aired on one of the larger cable channels. Many people have reacted with disgust to the fact that Casey Anthony is pregnant again, and protests and calls for a boycott of the show is almost a certainty. But the real question is whether Americans will watch? Somewhere, someone in television is betting on yes.

a162de08,"Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, will today warn that Government failure to meet NHS constitutional standards on staffing is driving a retention crisis. It comes as new research by Labour into the NHS workforce crisis reveals that over 200,000 nurses have left the NHS since 2010/11, alongside a 55% increase in voluntary resignations from the NHS. New research, verified by the House of Commons Library, revealed today shows: Voluntary resignations citing poor work-life balance have increased more than any other reason – by 169% between 2011/12 6,699 and 2017/18 18,013. The number of voluntary resignations for reasons of health has doubled 99% – from 2,126 resignations in 2011/12 to 4,234 in 2017/18. The percentage of ambulance staff leaving the NHS has increased by 3.3%, from 4.8% in 2011/12 to 8.1% in 2017/18. The average annual change in hospital and community staff has been just 0.8% since 2009/10 – substantially below the 2.9% achieved by the last Labour Government. Labour’s research is being released in anticipation of Baroness Dido Harding publishing a Workforce Implementation Plan for the NHS. In a speech this morning at the Institute for Public Policy Research IPPR think tank, Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, will commit Labour to investing in staff and training to help solve the workforce retention crisis, which has culminated in over 100,000 staff vacancies across the NHS. After years of Tory cuts, the budget for Continuing Professional Development for staff has been reduced to a third of its 2014/15 value, with just £84m dedicated to workforce development in 2018/19. Meanwhile, the abolition of the bursary for nurses and midwives saw applications for nursing courses fall by one third in the two years after March 2016. Ashworth will argue the Government is failing in its duties to staff enshrined in the NHS Constitution which are supposed to guarantee the rights to: Having a good working environment with flexible working opportunities, consistent with the needs of patients and with the way that people live their lives Having healthy and safe working conditions and an environment free from harassment, bullying or violence Being treated fairly, equally and free from discrimination Failure to meet these standards is driving the staff retention crisis we see today. As part of its guarantee to deliver Constitutional standards for the NHS workforce, Labour is today committing to: Restoring Continuing Professional Development Budgets to 2013/14 levels – an investment of approximately £330 million in 2023/24. Re-introducing nurse bursaries and reinstating funding for health related degrees to ensure those wanting to get into health professions are not put off by financial considerations. Guarantee training and reskilling for staff impacted by the coming wave of automation, AI, robotics and digitisation. Ongoing investment in pay and reward that goes beyond merely breaking the pay cap including staff that have been privatised. Putting in place a national Staff Wellbeing Strategy to support all staff including the creation of board level NHS Workforce Wellbeing Guardians in every local, regional and national NHS organisation. Legislating for safe staffing levels across the NHS. Endorsing the Fight Fatigue Campaign by the Association of Anaesthetists and the BMA’s Fatigue and Facilities Charter to deliver adequate rest facilities for NHS staff and help change cultural attitudes towards rest in hospitals, backed up by capital investment where necessary. Support the roll-out of an e-rostering scheme as pioneered at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton which has led to less reliance on junior doctor locums and rising quality of care. Expanding access to training through Further Education, demanding the government urgently reform and properly resource the apprenticeship levy in the NHS. And ensuring trusts, GP networks and area health footprints work together to create a schools work experience bureau service to inspire and encourage the next generation of health and care professionals. To end the uncertainty and red tape afflicting international recruitment Labour will provide work visas to anyone who has a job offer in the NHS at whatever level, and expand the Medical Training Initiative for all those wishing to take up the opportunity. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, is expected to say: “It’s utterly staggering that our NHS has lost over 200,000 nurses under the Tories and that voluntary resignations from the NHS is up 55 per cent. “We are facing a retention crisis in our NHS and standards which staff should expect – enshrined in the NHS Constitution – have simply been abandoned. “After years of pay restraint, cuts to training budgets and growing pressures it is no wonder the NHS is facing chronic shortages of 100,000 staff. These shortages affect patient care every day as waiting lists grow and operations are cancelled. “A Labour government will invest in NHS staff and help staff develop to meet the challenges of the future. It’s my ambition that the NHS becomes the best employer in the world. It’s not only the correct thing to do to improve the quality of care of patients, it’s in our economic interest as well.”","Wealthy professionals most likely to drink regularly, figures show",TRUE

Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked. The reports come from NHS Digital England only and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked. England had the highest proportion of adults who said they drank alcohol in the previous week 57.8%, followed by Scotland 53.5% and then Wales 50.0%; of the English regions, among consumers of alcohol, binge drinking was more common in the north-west and least common in the south-east. How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65. When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day. “Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. “The over-45s particularly are drinking more regularly but not thinking they’re in danger. But they are drinking four, five, six days a week and it all adds up. In 2016-17 [in England] there were 337,000 estimated hospital admissions attributable to alcohol – that’s a jump of 17%, nearly a fifth, on 2006-07,” he said. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example. “The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations. “Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP. “Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.” Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics.",Joe Biden Is Aiming To End The Federal Use Of Private Prisons,other
74adcdf1,"David Cameron today insisted that a 'few extra bombs and missiles' will not transform the situation in Syria, but pushed for Britain to join airstrikes against ISIS. The Prime Minister said it makes no sense that the RAF must respect an international border no longer recognised by jihadi fanatics plotting attacks on the UK. France, which last night launched a series of 'massive' air strikes on ISIS in Syria, has said it would be 'appreciated' if Britain joined the fight. But Mr Cameron warned he has yet to persuade enough MPs to ensure a vote on military action was not defeated by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who today said it could bring 'more mayhem and more loss'. RAF Tornados are carrying out bombing raids against ISIS in Iraq but David Cameron has yet to build support in Parliament for military action in neighbouring Syria Speaking at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey, David Cameron today insisted that a 'few extra bombs and missiles' will not transform the situation in Syria In the wake of the deadly gun and bomb attacks in Paris, 10 French jets dropped 20 bombs on the ISIS capital of Raqqa, destroying a key command centre, training camp and munitions dump and throwing the city into panic. The bombardment came just two days after President Francois Hollande said the co-ordinated attacks in Paris that killed up to 129 people was an 'act of war' and vowed to strike ISIS in Syria 'without mercy'. The jets launched from sites in Jordan and the Persian Gulf, in coordination with U.S. forces. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his country was justified in taking action in Syria. 'It was normal to take the initiative and action and France had the legitimacy to do so. We did it already in the past, we have conducted new airstrikes in Raqqa today, Fabius said. 'One cannot be attacked harshly, and you know the drama that is happening in Paris, without being present and active.' However, Britain is not taking part in the action in Syria because MPs have so far refused to authorise the extension of airstrikes in neighbouring Iraq. Mr Cameron was humiliated in 2013 when Tory rebels joined with Labour to vote down a plan to launch missile strikes against the Assad regime. There is a very strong case for saying Isil doesn't stop at the Iraq/Syria border and therefore neither should we Prime Minister David Cameron It forced the PM into an embarrassing retreat and damaged relations with US President Barack Obama who had to go it alone in sending jets into Syrian airspace. However, public outrage at the Paris attacks and the wider refugee crisis fuelled by the rise of ISIS has put the issue back on the table. Speaking at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey, Mr Cameron said: 'There is a very strong case for saying Isil doesn't stop at the Iraq/Syria border and therefore neither should we, but I recognise that I need to do more to build this argument, build this case, to take Parliament with me. 'I think people want to know that there is a whole plan for the future of Syria, the future of the region, because it is perfectly right to say that a few extra bombs and missiles won't transform the situation. 'As the secretary-general of the United Nations put it a few years ago: 'A missile can kill a terrorist, but it is good government and good governance that can kill terrorism'. That is what we need.' David Cameron, who today met Russian President Vladimir Putin to push for a political solution to the crisis in Syria, warned it makes no sense not to extend the strikes across a border which ISIS itself does not recognise Mr Cameron has repeatedly made clear he believes it makes no sense not to extend the strikes across a border which ISIS itself does not recognise. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I support the action in Syria. We are part of the enablers for that. It is happening anyway. The question is should we go further in joining that action. 'I've always said I think it is sensible that we should. ISIL does not recognise a border between Iraq and Syria and neither should we. 'But I need to build the argument. I need to take it to Parliament. I need to convince more people.' He insisted that British 'military hard power' was already having an effect in Iraq, where ISIS has 'lost about 25 to 30 per cent of the territory that they held'. UK military forces including drones had also been used to help find, target and kill leading ISIS fighters posing a direct threat to Britain, including former Cardiff schoolboy Reyaad Khan, killed by a British drone in Syria in August. British intelligence planes were also involved in the mission to trace ISIS murderer Jihadi John, who was killed by an American drone strike on Thursday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned that increased military action was not the solution to the crisis, and ruled out giving his MPs a free vote on military intervention LABOUR WILL NOT GET A FREE VOTE ON BOMBING ISIS IN SYRIA Jeremy Corbyn faces a challenge from his own MPs over military action in Syria after he ruled out allowing a free vote on bombing the ISIS stronghold. The Labour leader told Sky News: I’m hoping we will be able to come to that position in agreement, actually with a number of other Conservatives, so that is indeed the position I’m putting forward. I don’t think a free vote is something that we’re offering. It puts him on collision course with dozens of Labour MPs who privately think Britain should step up its involvement. Chris Leslie, former shadow chancellor, said: 'We shouldn't pre-empt any proposal about how to tackle the ISIS threat or rule anything out at this stage, surely?' Advertisement But Mr Cameron insisted he would not force a vote in the Commons on action in Syria unless he was sure he could win. 'We won't hold that vote unless we can see that Parliament would endorse that action because to fail on this would be damaging - it's not a question of damaging the government, its a question of not damaging our country and its reputation in the world. 'So I will build the case but in the end Parliament must decide. 'I have made the promise to Parliament as previous prime ministers have done that we won't commit to military action in a premeditate way without having a vote. 'Of course I think the British military would bring greater effect to what's happening in Syria. 'What we should be doing as well as building the argument doesn't stop at the Iraq-Syria border is we should be pushing for this political settlement which in the end is going to be the way that gives us a government in Syria that can represent all of the Syrian people and be our ally in wiping out the scourge of Islamist terror that is leading to the loss of life in our own countries and the Middle East.' However the Tory government the faces opposition from both Labour and dozens of Conservative MPs. Labour leader Mr Corbyn warned that increased military action was not the solution to the crisis. He told ITV's Lorraine: 'Does the bombing change it? Probably not. The idea has to be, surely, a political settlement in Syria, very difficult to achieve. 'There are some signs that the talks over the weekend have made some progress - Iran, Russia, USA, European Union, around a table together with all the regional governments, particularly Turkey is key. 'But also, who's funding ISIS, who is arming ISIS, who's providing safe havens for ISIS to get there. 'You have to ask questions about the arms that everyone has sold in the region, the role of Saudi Arabia in this, I think there are some very big questions and we have to be careful. One war doesn't necessarily bring about peace, it often can bring yet more conflict and more mayhem and more loss.' France's ambassador to the UK Sylvie Bermann has said it would be 'appreciated' if the RAF carried out raids in Syria alongside the French. She told Murnaghan: 'It is difficult to comment because it is not only a Government decision but they have decided to consult with the Parliament. If they do participate like us, of course we will appreciate it because we have always fought side by side but it is their decision.' She added: 'We have to fight side by side if we want to defeat terrorism. ' Former prime minister Tony Blair called for Britain to join airstrikes in Syria last week, before the Paris attacks: 'It's no great secret; I think it is essential for Britain to play its part in the fight against this hideous extremism that is brutalising the lives of so many people.' One of the ten French fighter jets prepares to take off from an airbase in the United Arab Emirates French fighter jets launch a wave of 'massive' air strikes on ISIS in Syria as the country started its 'pitiless' retribution for the Paris attacks SEVEN ATTACKS FOILED IN THE LAST YEAR AS 1,900 SPIES HIRED Britain is to recruit an extra 1,900 spies to counter the threat posed by ISIS terror cells in Syria. David Cameron today revealed seven deadly plots to cause havoc in the UK have been disrupted in the last 12 months. But he warned that the scale and severity of the attacks in Paris which left 129 people dead were far greater than anything seen by intelligence agencies to date. The security and intelligence services will receive a major increase in funding in response to the ISIS threat, which has been blamed for the bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt and the Paris attack in recent weeks. Mr Cameron announced a 15 per cent increase in the 12,700-strong staff of the security and intelligence agencies MI5, MI6 and GCHQ with the recruitment of an additional 1,900 personnel. Meanwhile spending on aviation security will increase to at least double the current £9million a year. The Prime Minister said the UK was engaged in a 'generational struggle' against extremist terror. The additional spending will help 'combat those who would destroy us and our values' and allow Britons to 'continue with our way of life we hold so dear'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I have been aware of these cells operating in Syria that are radicalising people in our own country, potentially sending people back to carry out attacks. 'Our security services have stopped seven attacks in the last six months, albeit on a smaller scale.' Downing Street later clarified that the figure was for the last year. Plans for how to respond to a Paris-style marauding gun attack have been reviewed in the wake of the Paris atrocity, which marked a change in the nature of ISIS plots. 'It could've happened here,' Mr Cameron said. 'We stand in total solidarity with France after the appalling attacks in Paris. Advertisement Tory MP Crispin Blunt, the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said an RAF bombing campaign in Syria would be an 'ineffective move' because 'it wouldn't be part of a coherent international plan to achieve our mission which is the defeat of Isis'. Mr Blunt told Sky News: 'Whether or not eight British aeroplanes should fly slightly wider air operations is not going to change anything militarily, the French are already flying there, the Americans are already flying the vast number of the missions there alongside now the Russians as well. 'Making that picture slightly more complex is not actually going to change the outcome and what we've got to do here is to focus on the outcome. What's the mission? The mission is to defeat Isis, we're not going to defeat the ideology immediately, that's going to take a much longer time but it's much easier to make sure that we can't have attacks projected on us such as the ones we've had in Paris if Isis does not control territory and there is nowhere for people to go, of whatever type, to go and fight for them. 'That territory has got to be taken off them, we've got to have an agreement about how to do that.' Labour under Mr Corbyn has vowed to oppose any extension of British involvement, calling for a 'peaceful' solution to the conflict. However the hardline stance risks putting him increasingly at odds with voters appalled at the Paris attacks. Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn told Sky News that it was not possible 'to defeat Isil in Syria just by dropping bombs'. Shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott said Labour will only consent to extending military action into Syria if there is a UN mandate to do so. Speaking in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, the shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott, outlined the circumstances which will be required for her party to back a bid to extend the UK's military role from Iraq and into Syria. She told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'As far as Labour's policy in relation to Syria, we actually discussed this at party conference and we have a policy. 'We can only agree to bomb in Syria first of all if there is a UN resolution and also, and this is my particular concern, if there is a plan to deal with the refugees that will result from further military action.' When asked if the Paris attacks had changed any of that, Ms Abbott said: 'Yes, it is a game changer in that it makes the need to resolve the civil war in Syria even more urgent than it was and that's part of Labour party's policy, that we put the need for a diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war right at the top of the agenda.'",David Cameron still wants to push for airstrikes against ISIS in Syria,partially false
ad333c3f,"Theresa May's hopes of winning a landslide Election victory suffered a major blow last night after her poll lead plummeted to 11 per cent amid the row over her tax and pension plans. A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday put the Conservatives on 40 per cent, followed by Labour on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems and Ukip level on 11 per cent. It means Mrs May’s lead over Jeremy Corbyn has nearly halved in four days: a poll immediately after she called the Election gave the Tories a 21-point advantage. A poll for the Mail on Sunday put the Conservatives on 40 per cent, followed by Labour on 29 per cent. It comes after backlash against the threat to drop pledges not to increase tax and to guarantee a minimum 2.5 per cent annual rise in pensions Polling expert Professor John Curtice said the Survation figures would give Mrs May a Commons majority of 46, an improvement on her current working majority of 17, but way below some forecasts of a 140-seat majority. The Conservative slump follows the threat to drop existing pledges not to increase tax and to guarantee a minimum 2.5 per cent annual rise in pensions. The backlash was further fuelled by Mrs May’s surprise announcement that she will not abandon the Party’s controversial promise to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid. The Mail on Sunday poll is the only one to have been conducted after all three stories broke, and shows voters are less likely to vote Tory as a result. The Prime Minister spurned three opportunities yesterday to contradict claims that she will drop David Cameron’s 2015 Election pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT until 2020. Put on the spot repeatedly at an election hustings in Dudley, West Midlands, she avoided giving a direct answer, merely stressing the Tories were a party of ‘low taxation’. Mr Corbyn immediately promised to protect pensions. Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked a tax scare, saying it was ‘self-evidently clear that the commitments in the 2015 manifesto strain the Government’s ability to manage the economy flexibly’ She said: ‘People are going to have a very clear election choice between a Conservative Party which always has been and will continue to be a party that believes in lower taxes. Or Labour, whose natural instinct is to always raise taxes.’ The Tory turmoil came after Mrs May refused to say she would stick to the so-called pensions ‘triple lock’ when questioned in her Maidenhead constituency on Friday. And Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked a tax scare, saying it was ‘self-evidently clear that the commitments in the 2015 manifesto strain the Government’s ability to manage the economy flexibly.’ Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell immediately called Mr Hammond’s statement a ‘Tory tax bombshell’, hijacking the Tories’ former slogan against Labour. 42 per cent said a Tory landslide would be ‘good’ for Britain with 36 per cent against. Former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt accused her of ‘an attempted power grab Tory MPs refused to comment publicly for fear of upsetting the party’s chances of success on June 8. However, privately, they were deeply critical. ‘It is an very untidy start to our campaign,’ said one. ‘Someone needs to get hold of our message – and fast. This is not the way to win votes.’ Former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont said: ‘I think Phillip Hammond is just trying to get some flexibility back into the system, although whether he was wise to say it is a different matter. ‘It is pretty ironic for Labour, of all people, to be using the “tax bombshell” line’. Senior Tory sources insisted ‘no final decision’ had been made on the Party’s manifesto stance on pensions and tax. Labour and the Lib Dems seized on the confusion. Mr Corbyn immediately promised to protect pensions, and former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Vince Cable said: ‘Mr Hammond admitted taxes would have to rise, no doubt due to Mrs May’s hard Brexit that could leave a £100 billion black hole in the public finances. 'You can’t have a strong economy and a hard Brexit.’ Asked in the poll if Mrs May’s refusal to rule out ending the pensions guarantee would affect their vote, 28 per cent said they were less likely to vote Tory, against 17 per cent who were more likely. Mr Hammond’s refusal to rule out raising tax prompted a similar negative response. And 34 per cent said refusing to cut overseas aid would make them less likely to vote Conservative. Only 13 per cent said they were more likely. former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Vince Cable said: 'You can’t have a strong economy and a hard Brexit.’ Mrs May was yesterday branded a ‘political opportunist’ by the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator over the snap Election The tax row comes just weeks after Hammond was forced to scrap plans to increase national insurance for the self-employed amid uproar over the effect on ‘white van man’ and the fact that it breached the 2015 manifesto vow on tax rises. Despite the sharply reduced lead, voters appear relaxed by the prospect of a Tory landslide. A total of 42 per cent said it would be ‘good’ for Britain with 36 per cent against. There was more Tory confusion last night as Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen claimed a ‘senior Government figure’ had told him the Party manifesto would include a commitment to scrap the controversial High Speed 2 train link to Birmingham. Downing Street sources denied the claim. And Mrs May was yesterday branded a ‘political opportunist’ by the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator over the snap Election.

Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades. But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade. Not only are 25 million unemployed or underemployed, but American companies continue to cut wages and benefits. The median wage is still dropping, adjusted for inflation. High unemployment has given employers extra bargaining leverage to wring out wage concessions. All told, it’s been the worst decade for American workers in a century. According to Commerce Department data, private-sector wage gains over the last decade have even lagged behind wage gains during the decade of the Great Depression (4 percent over the last ten years, adjusted for inflation, versus 5 percent from 1929 to 1939). Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. If corporations are people, as the Supreme Court’s twisted logic now insists, most of the big ones headquartered here are rapidly losing their American identity. CEO pay, meanwhile, has soared. The median value of salaries, bonuses and long-term incentive awards for CEOs at 350 big American companies surged 11 percent last year to $9.3 million (according to a study of proxy statements conducted for The Wall Street Journal by the management consultancy Hay Group.). Bonuses have surged 19.7 percent. This doesn’t even include all those stock options rewarded to CEOs at rock-bottom prices in 2008 and 2009. Stock prices have ballooned since then, the current downdraft notwithstanding. In March, 2009, for example, Ford CEO Alan Mulally received a grant of optionsand restricted shares worth an estimated $16 million at the time. But Ford is now showing large profits – in part because the UAW agreed to allow Ford to give its new hires roughly half the wages of older Ford workers – and its share prices have responded. Mulally’s 2009 grant is now worth over $200 million. The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. Meanwhile, the American economy has all but stopped growing – in large part because consumers (whose spending is 70 percent of GDP) are also workers whose jobs and wages are under assault. Perhaps there would still be something to celebrate on Labor Day if government was coming to the rescue. But Washington is paralyzed, the president seems unwilling or unable to take on labor-bashing Republicans, and several Republican governors are mounting direct assaults on organized labor (see Indiana, Ohio, Maine and Wisconsin, for example). So let’s bag the picnics and parades this Labor Day. American workers should march in protest. They’re getting the worst deal they’ve had since before Labor Day was invented – and the economy is suffering as a result.","This Labor Day, we need protests",TRUE
5daad203,"TALLAHASSEE — As the Florida Legislature finished its historic special session and sent a revamped redistricting map back to the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, another kind of history was being made. Dozens of state House members were voluntarily house hunting, running for a different office, or planning to sit out the next legislative session to avoid a matchup with another lawmaker. Republican James Grant filed papers Tuesday to run in a Pinellas-Hillsborough district that will force him to leave his current Carrollwood home. Rep. Perry Thurston, the incoming Democratic leader, planned to move in with his mom. Republican Eddy Gonzalez planned to rent in the Hialeah neighborhood where he grew up. And Rep. Scott Plakon of Longwood was ready to move in with his adult son a town over. ""It's historic,'' said Rep. Will Weatherford, the Wesley Chapel Republican and incoming House speaker who led the House's redistricting effort. ""It's the first time in the nation this many members have been drawn into the same districts where it wasn't a court order."" The result, he said: ""a lot of blood, sweat and tears,'' and a gradual realization that ""having control of our own destiny and our own maps was more important than anybody's individual political agenda."" The House completed the two-week legislative redistricting session Tuesday and voted 61-47 to pass the Senate's revamped map without change. The Florida Supreme Court had rejected the first Senate map for failing to follow the requirements of the new Fair Districts standards. The new proposal, which appears to create more visually compact districts than the first, also creates one less Republican majority seat, giving the GOP a 23-15 statistical advantage, with two swing districts. Democrats maligned the Senate's second map, saying it was fraught with many of the same problems as the first — from protecting incumbents, inexplicably dividing cities and counties and failing to protect minority voting strength. ""We'll see you in court,'' Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Brannon Jordan said in a terse statement. Miami-Dade Republicans joined with Democrats in opposing the map, voicing concern that the proposal doesn't create enough Hispanic districts despite huge gains in the population over the last decade. But Weatherford said he considered the Senate map constitutional and warned that rejecting the map would set a ""very dangerous precedent."" Unlike the Senate map, the House's proposed plan was approved by the court on the first review. Weatherford believes that was because legislators were willing to ""put the process and the chamber above themselves."" He recalls telling members after Fair Districts passed in November 2010: ""There will be political carnage from this."" For the next 18 months, every opportunity he had, he said, he would ""just hammer that home."" ""It conditioned the members and allowed them to come to terms with, early on, the fact that it was going to be a hard process,"" Weatherford said Tuesday. To ease the transition, Weatherford made a promise to any Republican House member who moved into a new district that he would protect them during the election season. ""It made the decision a little bit easier for some members,'' said Rep. Carlos Lopez Cantera, the House Republican leader. Still, Grant said the process was ""very tough."" Grant not only grew up in the district he now represents, but he lives 500 yards from his parents' home. He's moving to a redrawn district to the west that includes a majority of his current constituents. The move also means Grant will avoid a primary with Rep. Shawn Harrison, R-Lutz. ""No one ever expected to me leave Carrollwood,'' Grant said. But he said his father, the former state Sen. John Grant, had seen redistricting tangles before and ""was adamant that when I ran, I rent, rather than buy."" Thurston's move to his mother's home in Lauderhill will avoid a matchup with Rep. Elaine Schwartz, D-Hollywood. ""It's just two years,'' he said. ""Anybody can do anything for two years."" Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, will move into a neighboring district with his adult son to avoid being matched up with Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, who is slated to become House speaker after Weatherford. Only two current legislators — Reps. Jose Felix Diaz and Ana Rivas Logan, both Miami Republicans — don't see moving as an option. They plan to fight it out all summer for the lone seat. ""I own my house,'' Diaz said Tuesday. ""If the economy were different, maybe I could move, but it's not an option.""

4345f8fc,"The biggest issue, according to several people familiar with negotiations, involves a Democratic attempt to control the costs of vaccines and other treatments that are developed in response to the outbreak. Other issues include details of hospital reimbursement for uninsured patients and whether to pay for a provision to help expand telemedicine, which would cost roughly $500 million. “Vaccines should be affordable. It’s just as simple as that,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a top appropriator, said as she left a Democratic leadership meeting on Tuesday night. “It’s going back and forth. That’s where we are,” DeLauro added. “There are no firm answers at the moment, but we’re moving toward getting this done and getting it done this week because the need is so critical. We have to get it done this week.” Pelosi and her top deputies briefed their fellow Democrats on the status of the emergency funding package on Tuesday night and outlined the remaining issues. A final deal could still be reached Tuesday night, they said, but could take until Wednesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had complained earlier Tuesday that Republican lawmakers were resisting Democratic efforts to stave off potential price-gauging of vaccines or other products. “Our Republican friends don't want to see the kinds of limitations that we want to see,"" Schumer said after a briefing with members of the White House’s coronavirus task force, including Vice President Mike Pence and HHS Secretary Alex Azar. The 11th hour policy battles come after both parties had intended to present a united front against the potential epidemic, with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California each touting positive conversations with each other about the package as recently as Tuesday. Republicans and Democrats both stressed that the response to the virus should avoid mudslinging and fingerpointing. Still, some of the final details of the massive funding package have come down to partisan talking points. Democrats are insisting the spending package include significant funding to purchase large amounts of coronavirus diagnostics, treatments and vaccine, when it becomes available, which would then be made available to the public free of cost, according to a senior Democratic aide. The Democratic aide said Republicans are trying to eliminate the “fair and reasonable price” federal procurement standard for the vaccines and treatments that will be developed and purchased with the emergency funds. “Fair and reasonable price” is a basic standard to prevent price gouging in federal contracts. Republicans, however, argue they are trying to fight Democratic efforts to create a new set of price controls and that they are not asking for changes to the underlying procurement standards. The administration's top scientists have said any coronavirus vaccine could be at least a year away from reaching the market. Moderna Therapeutics is working with National Institutes of Health on a vaccine while Johnson & Johnson has received funding from HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The bill would provide funding for masks, ventilators, community preparations and vaccine development, Schumer said. But it's silent on how much vaccines developed with the government's backing should cost. “We are not going to say the companies after we taxpayers have paid for it, ‘now go out and make a huge profit.’ That's not going to happen,” said Senate Appropriations ranking member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). Congressional leaders still plan to pass an emergency package by the end of this week, with funding levels much closer to the $8.5 billion Democrats suggested than the Trump administration's $2.5 billion request. Both House and Senate leaders have stepped into overdrive as the global coronavirus outbreak poses a rising threat to the U.S., with 122 cases of the virus now reported. Lawmakers have also dramatically stepped up their oversight of the Trump administration's response, which had drawn flak in the early days of the outbreak, with its mixed messaging and a slow rollout of tests as cases accumuluate. Senate Democrats on Tuesday confronted Pence over the federal government’s response to the outbreak, even as leaders of both parties have quietly urged lawmakers to present a united front. Multiple Democrats said Pence and the task force did not have enough answers on testing kits, costs of care and what will happen to people who do not have insurance. Lawmakers including Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington, where nine deaths have been confirmed, challenged Pence during the hourlong meeting, which became contentious at times, according to attendees.

They believe they have been exposed, they are sick, they want to get tested — but they have nowhere to go.” Roughly $900 million in the bill would go toward purchasing equipment including masks and ventilators. Murray said that officials told senators they had stockpiled masks, but that there were not enough. Separately, health insurers want assurances the government will help pay the cost of widespread testing or expensive treatment. “There’s not enough test kits. We don’t know how wide it is. And it’s because the president dropped the ball early,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). Meanwhile, at the Senate Republican lunch, one attendee said senators suggested to Pence that the administration’s medical experts be the “point people” for the federal response. “No real pushback other than the recommendation that they just use people that are not politically appointed, real professionals in the area that way there can't be argument — oh, this is just political spin, it’s coming from doctors,” the attendee said. Pence, who President Donald Trump designated the lead on the virus response last week, made the rounds as the Trump administration tried to move past a raucous few days of partisan finger-pointing. Earlier on Tuesday, Pence hosted a group of House members who belong to the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the White House situation room. His message, according to several attendees, was to avoid political bickering as the U.S. grapples with a health crisis with a scale that remains unknown. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) laid out concerns with the administration’s outreach, including mixed messaging from Trump himself and various health agencies, according to multiple people in the room. Murphy, whose home city of Orlando includes Disney World, pressed Pence on which source of information should be trusted. Pence instructed her to refer to the CDC’s website. Another Democrat, Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, challenged information the administration has presented about the risk of transmission. He later said he urged the administration to be as transparent and “as conservative” as possible.

9b9c9838,"Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. As the world warms, evaporation speeds up. So on avg there's more water vapour for a storm to sweep up & dump now, compared to 70 years ago. https://t.co/M4R9OFFZt9 — Katharine Hayhoe (@KHayhoe) August 24, 2017 This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. “This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall. Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm.",Russian Lawyer Who Met Trump Jr. Saw a Clinton Scandal in Tax Inquiry,partially false

The Russian president has largely kept quiet over the refugee crisis in Europe but has now spoken out of his disbelief over its handling claiming that a continent that 'can't protect its children' has no future. His comments come off the back of a case in Austria last week, which saw an Iraqi migrant have his conviction of raping a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna overturned. He was originally convicted of the crime but it was overturned because a court didn't prove he realised the boy was saying no. It came after the migrant, identified as 20-year-old Amir A., claimed that it was a 'sexual emergency' because he had not had sex for four months. A second trial for the rape is expected to take place next year, but the attacker is likely to remain in custody until then. And speaking at a press conference this week, Putin slammed Europe's migration policy and cited the case, where the victim was from a Serbian family living in Austria. He said: 'In a European country, a child is raped by a migrant, and the court releases him. 'It doesn’t fit into my head what on earth they’re thinking over there. His comments come off the back of a case in Austria last week, which saw an Iraqi migrant accused of raping a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna, pictured The young boy had arrived in Austria with his Serbian mother, who paid for him to go to the Theresienbad swimming pool, pictured, where he was violently attacked 'I can’t even explain the rationale – is it a sense of guilt before the migrants? What’s going on? It’s not clear.' He also claimed that the case highlighted 'the dissolution of traditional national values' adding: 'A society that cannot defend its children has no future.' And Putin's words appeared to have struck a chord, as he is extremely popular with Serbs. In the rape case, the boy had arrived in Austria with his Serbian mother, who paid for him to go to the Theresienbad swimming pool, where he was violently attacked. The boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the Iraqi man's second trial, outraging the Austrian Serbian community. Austrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers, who were previously divided about whether to vote for the left-leaning Green party candidate or the far right option Nobert Hofer in upcoming elections.

b4b6057f,"SHARE Madison - Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to increase funding for voucher and public charter schools as well as his plan to create a new stream of funding to allow special-needs children to attend private schools drew immediate criticism Sunday from the state's largest teacher union, public school advocates and a major disability rights group. According to funding proposals unveiled by the governor's office Sunday, Walker is making money available that could be used as incentive payments for teachers and schools based on how well schools perform on state report cards. Walker will propose a modest increase - roughly 1% - in funding for Wisconsin public schools in his budget to the Legislature on Wednesday, two years after his steep cuts and all but elimination of collective bargaining for teachers sparked the unsuccessful movement to recall Walker from office. Tom Beebe, project director for Opportunity to Learn Wisconsin, a liberal-leaning group and former executive director of the Wisconsin Alliance for Excellent Schools, has been critical of Walker's cuts to education. He said the amount of general aid increase proposed for this next biennial budget - $129.2 million over two years - only amounts to about $161 for each of Wisconsin's 800,000 public-school students. ""If the revenue cap does not go up, then there is no new money going to schools no matter how much aid increases,"" Beebe said. ""The increase in school funding simply goes to property-tax payers, not into the classroom."" Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state's largest teacher union, said the modest increase was really just keeping overall revenue for schools flat. ""The stagnant revenue on top of the largest cuts to education funding in Wisconsin history in the last budget is another clear indication that this governor has no intention of supporting neighborhood schools,"" Bell said in a statement. ""(Walker's) real focus is privatizing public education with another infusion of resources to the unaccountable taxpayer-funded private school voucher program while leaving our neighborhood public schools on life support,"" she added. The Republican-controlled Legislature will review Walker's budget over the next four months and make changes before voting on it sometime in June. The two-year spending plan takes effect in July. State Rep. Sondy Pope, ranking Democrat on the Assembly's Education Committee, said Walker's proposal isn't enough. At the rate of state aid funding for public schools, it would take 12 years to replace the money lost in the last budget, she said. Walker contends schools have been able to save money because the collective bargaining law also required teachers to contribute more toward their pension and health care benefits. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance reported in November that those cuts in benefits and limiting union-negotiated raises to the rate of inflation offset about two-thirds of the reductions in school revenue in the 2011-'12 academic year. Pope said the increase in aid Walker is proposing won't be enough to help schools struggling to make ends meet. ""These people are trying to starve Wisconsin public schools,"" she said. Republican Sen. Luther Olsen, chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, said he was glad to see Walker putting more money into public education. ""It's a lot better than having to cut like we did in the last budget,"" he said. ""It's not as much as I wanted, but we're glad it's not negative or zero."" Walker's funding for schools includes $73 million more for voucher schools, $23 million for charter schools, and $21 million in grants for special-needs students to receive a voucher to attend private schools. A proposal for those special-needs vouchers passed the Assembly last session, despite broad opposition from the state Department of Public Instruction, disabilities rights groups, and the state school boards association. It did not pass the Senate. Lisa Pugh, public policy coordinator for Disability Rights Wisconsin, expressed concern that special-needs vouchers were now being proposed as part of the budget, because it would be a significant policy change in the way students with special needs are served. And that should be debated in education legislative committees, she said. Also, the $21 million for special-needs children could have been applied to help public schools across the state, not just for the minority of children who could use that taxpayer subsidy to attend a private school, she said. Walker's plans for expanding the more well-known voucher system encompassing Milwaukee's long-standing program and Racine's new program are highly anticipated, but he did not immediately provide those details. Funding for the UW System would go up $181 million under the budget, two years after it was cut by $315 million. Technical college aid would increase $5 million. UW spokesman David Giroux said the increased funding, coupled with the university being exempted from so-called lapses that could have resulted in $66 million in cuts, was ""very positive."" ""We want to create a stronger workforce for Wisconsin, and new taxpayer investments are essential to that effort,"" Giroux said. ""It looks like we will have enough funding to preserve today's levels of college access and quality, along with new investments in UW programs focused on job creation. That's a smart investment."" Walker is making $64 million available in incentive payments for K-12 schools, tied to their grades on statewide report cards. Of that, $24 million would go to schools with an A or B grade, $30 million would go to schools that show a certain level of improvement on the report cards and $10 million would be available to the lowest-performing districts for a one-time grant if they provide an acceptable improvement plan. Brian Pleva, lobbyist for the American Federation for Children Wisconsin, a conservative group, praised Walker's increase for voucher- and charter-school funding because it would give low-income and middle-class parents more educational choices. He also said that special-needs scholarships would help a minority of families for which local public schools aren't meeting their children's needs. Walker said in a statement Sunday that the budget proposals will reward successes and provide incentives to schools to drive achievement and accountability. In this next biennial budget, total K-12 funding would go up $276 million, according to the AP. But Walker will not lift the lid on revenue limits, saying he was concerned about moves that might cause property taxes to increase. The proposed increase in aid to schools comes after Walker cut general school aid by $834 million two years ago, a more than 8% drop from the previous funding period. To restrict school boards from raising property taxes to replace the drop in school aid, the governor proposed reducing districts' revenue limit authority - the combined amount they're able to raise in local property taxes and state general school aid - by 5.5%. As a result, the average school per-pupil revenue limit dropped about $555 in 2011-'12, from $10,100 in 2010-'11.

The package of legislation fails to address Illinois’ fiscal and economic crisis – and in fact, makes it worse in the long run. It does not balance the budget. It does not make nearly sufficient spending reductions, does not pay down our debt, and holds schools hostage to force a Chicago bailout. This budget package does not provide property tax relief to struggling families and employers. It does not provide regulatory relief to businesses to create jobs and grow the economy. It does not include real term limits on state elected officials to fix our broken political system. Even with the Madigan permanent 32% income tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018. This budget will require even more tax hikes to balance the budget and pay down the bill backlog. This budget puts Illinois on track for major future tax increases and will lead us to become the highest taxed state in America in the coming years. Moreover, this budget package holds K-12 school funding across Illinois hostage to force a bailout of Chicago Public Schools. Hidden in this budget are terms that withhold school funding unless the school funding formula is rewritten to shift money from suburban and downstate school districts to CPS. Budgets in Illinois will not be balanced or stay balanced unless our economy grows faster than our government spending. We have been ignoring that truth for 35 years. This budget package includes no changes to create jobs and grow our economy. It will push more families and businesses out of our state. Therefore, pursuant to Section 9(b) of Article IV of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, I hereby return Senate Bill 6, entitled “AN ACT concerning appropriations”, with the foregoing objections, vetoed in its entirety.

16a78b84,"The amount of the NHS budget going to private healthcare firms has reached unprecedented levels, despite the health secretary’s pledge to roll back outsourcing of patient care. The Department of Health and Social Care handed a record total of £9.2bn last year to private providers such as Virgin Care and the Priory mental health group, its annual report shows. That is an increase of 14% from the £8.1bn that went to profit-driven healthcare companies in 2014-15 and £410m more than the £8.77bn they received in 2017-18. It comes after Matt Hancock pledged to MPs in January that “there is no privatisation of the NHS on my watch”. The House of Commons Library has verified the upward trend and sums involved from analysis it undertook at Labour’s request of figures about the DHSC’s purchase of healthcare from organisations outside the NHS contained in the last five years of the ministry’s accounts. “Tory privatisation of our NHS continues to gather pace with public expenditure on independent providers now at a record high”, said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health and social care secretary. “These accounts blow apart Matt Hancock’s claims to parliament there would be no privatisation on his watch.” The relentless rise in NHS privatisation is occurring even though NHS England has declared its desire to drastically reduce what it says it views as the damaging tendering of services as part of its drive to create much more integrated care, ideally delivered by NHS providers. It has produced detailed proposals – backed by Theresa May – that it hopes will form the basis of legislation to drive private firms out of the provision of NHS care as far as possible. The DHSC’s accounts also disclose that its total spending on all non-NHS bodies has risen even more sharply than that on private firms, from £10.32bn in 2014-15 to £13.75bn last year – an increase of £3.43bn or 33% over four years. The department stressed that, while the overall amount was going up, the rise in its budget meant that the proportion of that going to private firms had remained constant at 7.3%. That bigger £13.75bn total includes money handed to both the voluntary and not-for-profit sector, which has risen threefold over that time from £530m to £1.62bn, and also to local councils, which has gone from £1.77bn to £2.9bn. The latter is thought to cover spending on social care, community mental health services and continuing healthcare, in which the NHS pays for medical care for people with a disability, injury or illness who are living at home or in a care home. Campaigners against NHS privatisation strongly criticised the record £9.2bn spend on private care. “The extra £415m spent on private providers in the last year is a significant 5% increase and makes a nonsense of Matt Hancock’s pledge of ‘no privatisation on my watch’”, said Dr John Lister, a health policy academic and secretary of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. Private firms receive a far bigger slice of the share of the budget for certain forms of care than the independent sector’s 7.3% average, he pointed out. “Last year, roughly 30% of all mental health spending was in the private sector and 44% of spending on child and adolescent mental health goes to private providers. Private sector domination is most complete in the provision of controversial ‘locked ward rehabilitation’, in which a massive 97% of a £304m market in 2015 was held by private companies”, he said. “The full picture is much more alarming with the added prospect of a Johnson government putting the NHS ‘on the table’ in any future US trade negotiations.” Paul Evans, the director of the NHS Support Federation, which monitors privatisation of healthcare, said: “In response to criticism, failures and waste, the health secretary promised no further privatisation. But since then the outsourcing of NHS services has rolled on and more services have become reliant on the private sector to deliver their core services.” For example, a third of all hip replacements on the NHS are now done privately. Despite the pledge to roll back privatisation, for-profit firms have consistently won contracts to deliver community health, mental health and diagnostics services in the last five years, Evans added. “Despite the NHS long-term plan calling for an end to the experiment with competition and outsourcing, the government has done nothing to change the rules that force the NHS to advertise its contracts to the private sector. The accounts of the Priory Group, the largest mental health provider, show that 52% of its income of almost £800m comes from the NHS,” he said. A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “We are committed to a world-class NHS free at the point of use. The proportion of NHS funding going to independent sectors has remained largely stable since 2014-15. The overall funding in the NHS has increased since 2014-15, so while the proportion of spend has not changed, the amount spent has risen in both public and independent sectors. “We want patients to receive the best quality of care possible and the vast majority is provided by the NHS, supported by independent organisations when a local doctor decides it is in their patients’ best interests.”",Florida Alert: The Truth about Open Carry -- Erroneous Claims Exposed,TRUE
93994bac,"The introduction of Universal Credit UC will leave working families worse off on average, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. UC, which combines six benefits into one monthly payment, was intended to be more generous than the current system but the IFS said cuts to the programme meant this would not be the case. But it said UC would encourage people into work and save £2.7bn a year. Ministers said the IFS had ignored other benefits such as extra childcare. Universal Credit's single payment replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance JSA and Employment and Support Allowance ESA. According to the IFS research, an estimated 2.1 million families will face an average loss of £1,600 a year, while 1.8 million will gain an average of £1,500. Its figures suggest 1.1 million homes with no-one in paid work will lose out by about £2,300 a year, while 500,000 are expected to gain of £1,000. Working single parents are said to face an annual loss of £1,000. The new payments system still only affects a minority of claimants, but it is gradually being rolled out across the country. Single parents Robert Joyce, the author of the IFS report, added: The potential gains from simplifying the working-age benefit system remain mostly intact: Universal Credit should make the system easier to understand, ease transitions into and out of work, and largely get rid of the most extreme disincentives to work or to earn more created by the current system. The government has always said that Universal Credit UC would encourage more people to find work. The IFS said that was true for most people, but not all. It said that single parents, for example, had less of an incentive to work under UC than under the old system. Where couples are concerned, UC encourages just one of them to find employment, rather than both, the IFS claimed. Single parents claiming UC will keep 8% less of their earnings than previously, its figures suggest. People outside Jobcentre Plus officeimage copyrightPA image captionFrom April 2017, new UC applicants will only be able to claim for a maximum of two children 'Evasive' Although Chancellor George Osborne abandoned cuts to tax credits in the Autumn, cuts to UC announced last summer will still go ahead. From this April the amount that anyone on UC can earn before their benefits are cut will be reduced. This so-called Work Allowance will be £4,764 for those not claiming for housing costs, or £2,304 for those who do. Once claimants earn above that amount, they lose 65p for every pound they are paid. From April 2017, parents making new UC claims will only be able to take their first two children into account, while the first child premium will be abolished. Separately, a committee of MPs has also complained that UC is getting further and further behind schedule. The Public Accounts Committee report accused the Department for Work and Pensions DWP of being evasive when asked about the delays. But the DWP said that the programme was being rolled out safely and securely and would be completed by March 2021. The overhaul of the welfare system has been driven by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who argued that too many people were trapped on benefits. But shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said Mr Duncan Smith's claims were in tatters. He said everyone can now see that successive cuts to Universal Credit have destroyed many of the work incentives that were supposed to be the very reason for the scheme, hitting single parents particularly hard. The government has always said that no individuals will lose money as a result of the changes. New claimants for UC will also be helped by transitional support. And a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: Universal Credit will make work pay and increase financial incentives for people to work more, while also bringing the welfare bill under control. He added: Universal Credit also includes a wide range of additional benefits - including increased childcare and more support from a dedicated work coach both things that were ignored in the IFS's analysis.",051316 repisraelpr,partially false
745c07fe,"You have been sent here because your child, partner, or friend suggested that you invest your life savings into GameStop stock and you are curious what the fuck is going on. This post is long and thorough and mostly does not discuss memes and ""the internet"" until the end, but if you read it you will hopefully understand What Is Happening. What is going on is that GameStop, a company that sells physical copies of video games next to Auntie Anne’s pretzel shops in dying malls, is the most highly traded asset in the United States, a “meme stock,” and currently the primary front in a micro class war. GameStop’s stock price jumped from $4 last summer to $20 at the end of 2020, to $40 two weeks ago. It was worth $100-ish at times on Monday and Tuesday, and as I write this it is worth close to $300. Essentially, many normal-ish people have made a huge bet against gigantic financial institutions and are currently winning. In practice this means we are seeing one of the largest wealth transfers from the financial ruling class to the middle and middle-upper classes in recent memory, so it is, understandably, the only thing anyone is talking about. How did this happen? A bunch of Redditors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, led by a person going by ""DeepFuckingValue,"" analyzed GameStop stock and concluded that its price was undervalued. They then, over the course of months, identified a weakness in the strategies of several giant hedge funds that had bet many millions of dollars that GameStop would fail. These Redditors purchased huge numbers of GameStop stock at low prices (and then kept buying more as the prices rose), held it, and are currently forcing something known as a “short squeeze” that is driving the price up and is emptying these hedge funds in the process. These Redditors are diamond-handing (holding) their stocks, imploring each other to not be a weak-minded stock seller (paper hands) and are waiting for their messiah Ryan Cohen—the CEO of Chewy.com who invested millions in GameStop last year—to hitch them to his rocket and take them to the moon/sun/Mars (become very rich). Advertisement A few weeks ago I became interested in WallStreetBets. I bought 14 shares of GameStop, knowing that if I put a small amount of money in I would actually pay attention to the subreddit and what people were writing about. I did not expect the stock to become worth any money but now I can afford to fix my broken car. I do not have other stocks outside of my 401k. Elon Musk, random venture capitalists, and Mad Money Jim Cramer are all ancillary characters who have made cameos on this journey, and you've got a lot to catch up on: WHAT IS GAMESTOP: GameStop is the number one physical video game retailer in the United States, which means a lot less than it used to in the 1990s, and also has a bunch of stores internationally. GameStop has been closing stores and losing money over the last few years because of the slow death of retail, caused largely by digital storefronts such as Steam and companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo opting to sell digital copies of their titles on their own digital stores. The pandemic has also not been good for GameStop. Even though video game sales are skyrocketing, GameStop is a physical store and had to close many locations to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2020. Advertisement This has led many financial forecasters to declare that death is inevitable for GameStop, a prognostication that led big hedge funds and capital firms to “short” GameStop stock. WHAT IS ‘SHORTING’ AND WHO IS DOING IT? “Shorting” is a bet that a company's stock will become less valuable. This is done when an investor sells shares of a stock that they do not own. Essentially, they sell shares of a stock at a certain (high) price in the belief that sometime in the near future the price of that stock will go down. They will then be able to buy the stock at the lower price to “cover” their shorts, “closing” the deal and pocketing the difference between the price they sold at and bought at as profit. This is something that giant hedge funds do all the time, often to the chagrin of CEOs like Elon Musk. Often, by betting against a company short sellers are able to put downward pressure on the stock price. What this means is that a struggling company’s stock price can go down simply because a giant hedge fund invests millions or hundreds of millions of dollars shorting it. The mere act of a hedge fund—which are smarter than everyone else, the thinking goes—betting against a company can start a news cycle where investor-types think a company is going to fail, investors sell or get scared, and the stock price goes down. The short sellers win and make a bunch of money. Advertisement Sometimes, however, short sellers lose. This happens when they bet on a stock price to go down, but it goes up instead. The important thing to remember here is that there is theoretically no limit to how much money a short seller can lose. This is because if a short seller shorts a stock at $20, the stock price can continue to go up and the short seller must, at some point, buy that stock to close its position and fulfill its side of the bargain. If I short one stock at $20 and the price of that stock goes to $1 million, I still at some point have to buy that share to close the deal. In this case I would lose $999,980. In this case, a company called Melvin Capital Management shorted millions of dollars in GameStop stock. Another company called Citron Research shorted some large amount of GameStop stock and has also spent much of the last several months explaining why GameStop is a dogshit company that is going to fail. These are companies that most (normal) people have not heard of but are a big deal in the financial world. These companies (as well as a few others), made risky bets that GameStop stock would continue to go down, allowing them to profit immensely, as they usually do. But not this time. WHAT WENT WRONG FOR MELVIN, CITRON, AND THE SHORT SELLERS, INITIALLY As I mentioned earlier, short sellers at some point have to actually buy shares of the company they’ve shorted in order to close their positions and exit their deal. If they do this when a stock's price is higher than their short, they will lock in their losses. So Citron and Melvin and other short sellers have been playing a fabulously expensive game of chicken. Because for the last few months, GameStop stock has slowly been increasing in price. Advertisement The bullish case for GameStop is predicated on the fact that it had a good earnings report earlier this month (its digital sales were up 309 percent), and also saw a big investment from a guy named Ryan Cohen, who is the cofounder of the online pet store Chewy. Chewy is a very successful company and Cohen is seen as a very competent person. Cohen revealed a nearly 10 percent stake in GameStop in September of last year, and upped his stake to nearly 13 percent in December. His investment eventually led to him joining GameStop’s board of directors with ideas like pushing digital sales in tow, which drove investor confidence in the company (because of his prior successes), and pushed the stock price up. It also drove positive media coverage, which, sometimes, can also drive stock prices up. With GME stock prices going up, Melvin, Citron, and short sellers have been waiting for a price crash to cover their positions that has never come. Advertisement The most important thing (as I understand it, at least), and a situation that happens only very rarely, is that short sellers shorted more shares of GameStop than actually exist. What this means is that even if every single short seller wanted to cut their losses and close their positions, they would be unable to do so because the shares don’t exist. Normally this isn’t that much of a problem because over time they’d be able to buy enough stock to close their positions due to people buying and selling stock back and forth. In this case, however, Redditors noticed what was going on and have royally fucked short sellers. Crucially, Redditors on WallStreetBets are holding their stocks Because people haven’t been selling the stock, and because it’s continued to go up, short sellers have been unable to cover their shorts without locking in billions in losses and are unable to cover their shorts entirely because the stock has been over shorted. Here is where things get truly complicated and beyond the scope of this blog. Essentially, you (meaning you, the average person) can buy shares at the market price, no problem. But short sellers want to see a sell-off frenzy, where prices plummet and they can buy huge numbers of shares to reduce their losses or, ideally, lock in their gains. Big short sellers needs to quite literally buy hundreds of thousands or millions of shares, and so they are left waiting for a selling frenzy that may never arrive, or won't come until GameStop has become worth many hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Advertisement Anyways, this brings us to Reddit and WallStreetBets. WHAT IS WALLSTREETBETS This is what WallStreetBets looks like on Reddit: And this is what it looks like on Discord: And this is what it sounds like: r/WallStreetBets is a subreddit that describes itself as “4chan with a Bloomberg Terminal,” which is the laziest but probably most apt way to think of it. It is a subreddit for people who like to gamble on the stock market that has its own culture, terminology, characters, and villains. It's also very toxic, similar to 4chan. You can broadly think of WallStreetBets as a bunch of investors who think that it is very boring to take a small portion of your paycheck and invest it in your 401k and wait to get old to be rich. It is full of day traders without a ton of money who YOLO their money into a single stock (invest their life savings, or their mom’s life savings, or their student loan payments, or their paychecks), to hopefully realize a giant profit in a short period of time by taking advantage of temporary price movements. Historically, the top posts in this subreddit are “loss porn” and “gain porn,” which are screenshots of people’s investment portfolios showing how they turned a small amount of money into a huge amount of money in a short period of time, or turned a huge amount of money into a tiny amount of money in a short period of time. The broader financial investment world thinks these people are morons and degenerates, and the prevailing financial wisdom is that investing a significant amount of money into specific companies' stocks (versus index funds that mirror the entire market or an entire market sector) is very risky and best left to pros and People Who Know Better, such as giant hedge funds and billionaires. This is the type of advice that financial advisors and podcasters have to give because “take a cash advance on your credit card and invest it all into a stock symbol that you picked randomly from a Ouija board” is not defensible and not advisable to the public at large. Advertisement All of that said, the stock market has been increasingly unmoored from the actual economy, with the stock market as a whole skyrocketing in price over the last 24 months even as hundreds of thousands of people die from a pandemic, millions of people lose their jobs, and billionaires get richer while the rest of us get poorer. Picking random stocks and investing money into them has been a legitimately successful strategy for many people over this short time sample period. It surely will not last. But nonetheless it is working. WALLSTREETBETS AND GAMESTOP In September 2019, a redditor named DeepFuckingValue posted a screenshot of himself investing $53,000 into GameStop stock over the preceding few months, at prices of between 30 cents and 75 cents per share. On that day, his shares were worth $113,000, a gain of 86 percent. GameStop stock was worth 85 cents at the time. This post didn’t take off, but over the months, DeepFuckingValue, who goes by the name ""RoaringKitty"" on YouTube, continued to post updates on their GameStop YOLO. On YouTube, they laid out their case for why they invested in GameStop, which largely came down to GameStop’s strong online sales, the fact that it was closing stores (reducing costs) and that its per-store revenue was increasing as it did so. Advertisement Other redditors and DeepFuckingValue eventually caught on that something else was happening with GameStop stock: It was the most shorted stock in the entire stock market. That, combined with what DeepFuckingValue described as “strong fundamentals,” suggested that, at some point, these short sellers would be forced to close their positions. The opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, is that short sellers overextended themselves and would only be able to close their positions: A) at a loss and B) if suddenly a bunch of people who own GameStop stock sold their stock, which would drive it down. WallStreetBets at the time had more than a million subscribers, and DeepFuckingValue's gain porn was going viral on the subreddit back in December, when the stock prices were around $4. His gains led more people to invest in GameStop, further driving the price up. People began to write treatises on why they believed GameStop was a good investment, leading to more investing. All of this put more pressure on short sellers, which helped snowball the stock up, leading to unrealized gains for all. The rallying cry of the entirety of the WallStreetBets subreddit and its extraordinarily chaotic Discord became: buy GameStop stock, hold it, and fuck over the big hedge funds, specifically Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which, throughout this entire saga, was publishing various YouTube videos about why it believed GameStop stock would go down. Advertisement This created a trollish us-versus-them mentality. If you bought GameStop stock, you are cool and going to become rich. If you sell GameStop stock before you ride its rocket to Mars, you are a coward and are only helping these big hedge funds and fucking over your fellow Redditor. All throughout this, DeepFuckingValue's account went from $50k, to $100k, to several million, to $10 million, to $20 million. DeepFuckingValue did not sell their stock, as far as we know—if they could be brave enough to hold then, you, a lowly investor, could afford to also hold your stock, further driving the price up as Melvin and The Establishment began to sweat. WHY THE STOCK HAS GONE COMPLETELY BANANAS This brings us to this week. By all accounts, Melvin Capital is in deep trouble. Earlier this week, it took in $2.75 billion in funding, reportedly to help cover its GameStop shorts. A prominent venture capitalist said he was buying GameStop stock. Every financial publisher is talking about GameStop stock. Elon Musk, who, again, famously hates Tesla's short sellers with a burning passion, tweeted about GameStop stock and said that he's hanging out in the WallStreetBets Discord. Meanwhile, the GameStop shorts have seemingly not figured out an elegant way out of this. Many prognosticators and analysts on WallStreetBets have been writing posts explaining why they believe GameStop stock will go over $1,000 or $5,000 per share, which involves a scenario where banks and investment platforms themselves require short sellers to cover their shorts all at once, which will make the stock go even crazier than it already has. This seems to be the prevailing wisdom among GME investors at the moment—the stock is worth $350 as I write this, but most people on the subreddit seem unsatisfied. They are out to make a life-changing amount of money and they are out for hedge fund blood. Advertisement IS THIS ILLEGAL / WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? Probably no one is going to jail, but some hedge funds will likely go bankrupt. WallStreetBets is not “manipulating” the market, really. People are posting publicly-available information and their own analyses of what they believe a stock will do, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are reading that analysis and acting on their own. They are largely doing what stock prognosticators do all day every day on TV shows about stocks. WHAT ABOUT NOKIA, BEST BUY, BLACKBERRY, AMC, ETC WallStreetBets is also investing heavily in Nokia, Best Buy, Blackberry, AMC Theaters, and other stocks. I am not a financial expert and don’t know what will happen with these but in the short term these stocks have also seen large gains (but smaller than GameStop). All of them have been shorted, but not shorted as heavily as GameStop. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS The financial press is trying to explain what this means for them, hedge funds, capitalism, the economy, and the stock market moving forward. Internet culture reporters are trying to explain if this is GOOD or BAD, if this is the Donald Trump-ification of the stock market, where a meme or troll gets out of control and causes unprecedented havoc on the real world. Anthony Scaramucci, of all people, is calling this the ""French Revolution of finance."" It is true that this means something and that this is likely a big moment. We are seeing, I think, the democratization of financial information, at least to some extent. While we've seen technology like deepfakes and facial recognition filter down from research firms and big companies into the hands of ordinary people and amateur technologists who then use them for whatever purposes they want, we are seeing financial technologies, information, and analysis becoming available not just to hedge fund managers, financial institutions, and the very rich, but to the masses. It is clear that there is a sect of WallStreetBets who either previously or currently work in the financial sector who are fed up with increasing inequality, are tired of watching giant corporations repeatedly fuck over ordinary people, and are explaining how it all works to huge groups of people. What they are doing is risky, but it's not ""very stupid."" We have been told for decades that the banks and the people who work at Goldman Sachs and Fidelity and hedge funds none of us have ever heard of are smarter than us, that they deserve to be rich, that they should be the ones who pull the levers on the economy, that they should decide which companies are good and which are bad, that they should be the ones who help make financial regulations. All along the way they have gotten fabulously wealthy and we have been stuck with stagnant wages, record consumer debt, and financial advice that tells us to wait until we are old to retire. WallStreetBets says this is a new paradigm where the masses have the power and hedge funds are scared. A top post on the subreddit this morning was called this: ""FOR ALL THE BIG FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS MONITORING US, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM US TO YOU, WE FUCKING OWN YOU NOW, FUCK. YOU."" It's unclear how far this will go. After all, people with thousands of dollars to invest in GameStop still have thousands of dollars to invest with, unlike the millions of people in the U.S. currently out of work due to a deadly pandemic. The free investment app of choice, Robinhood, was also just fined by the SEC for hosing its own customers by seeking favorable rebates instead of the best prices for its users. And even if some hedge funds are getting bodied by retail investors, the massive funds such as Fidelity and Blackrock that own tens of millions of GameStop shares are probably just as happy.",Boko Haram leader Shekau says he's ready to surrender-Military — Daily Times Nigeria,other
9ba64668,"Murderers of Stephen Lawrence and Garry Newlove jailed under same law The widow of a murdered former policeman today slammed an 'absolutely disgusting' Supreme Court decision to grant one of her husband's killers a shock appeal. Tracey Fyfe, 53, says she is 'terrified' Ameen Jogee, 24, could be released from prison where he is serving a life sentence for murdering Paul Fyfe, 47, with his friend Mohammed Hirsi in 2011. Drug dealer Jogee told Hirsi to stab the father-of-three through the heart and was convicted of murder using 'joint enterprise' law, which demands the accomplice is treated the same as the killer. But today the Supreme Court - Britain's highest court - ruled 'joint enterprise' has been wrongly interpreted for more than 30 years and granted Jogee the chance to appeal his conviction. More than 500 killers could seek to have their sentences quashed and the winning legal team said it is 'inevitable' many will now 'test the correctness of a number of historic convictions'. Mrs Fyfe said: 'This decision is absolutely disgusting. Criminals like Ameen Jogee would literally be getting away with murder. Heartbroken: Tracey Fyfe, pictured today with daughter Jessica Fyfe, 20, who now fears a Supreme Court ruling could see her husband Paul's killer freed from his life sentence Landmark case: Ameen Jogee, left, was convicted of murdering a former policeman with Mohammed Hirsi, right, but today judges ruled 'joint enterprise' was wrongly applied and could see 500 murderers appeal Tragedy: The family of Paul Fyfe, pictured with his widow Tracey, say that his killer Jogee will 'get away with murder' if he is released 'He is from the same city as myself and my family. It terrifies me that he could one day walk past myself and my daughters in the street. Murder: Paul Fyfe, pictured a year before he died in 2011, was stabbed in the heard by Hirsi with Jogee, a drug dealer, egging him on from the doorstep 'If Ameen Jogee hadn't been there that night neither would Hirsi. Ameen Jogee was using Hirsi as a weapon'. And the mother of a boy brutally murdered by a gang in Victoria Station convicted using joint enterprise has also described the Supreme Court ruling as 'devastating'. Naima Ghailan, whose son Sofyen Belamouadden was stabbed to death aged 15 by a 20-strong gang in front of horrified commuters in March 2010, says the ruling is wrong. Ms Ghailan broke down in tears on hearing the news and said: 'This makes it even worse. Imagine how the people who lost their loved ones feel like after this. It is devastating news. 'I don't think the law is strong enough in this country'. Supreme Court president Lord Neuberger said today those who foresaw murder or egged on the killer are not automatically guilty of the same crime as directed by the law in 1984. Anti-joint enterprise campaigners say it is 'a major turning point in British justice' and believe 650 jailed criminals, including some of our most notorious killers, could have convictions quashed. 'Joint enterprise' was used to convict the killers of Stephen Lawrence and Garry Newlove and 500 others in the past decade alone - and many could now try to appeal. The recent case of case of Shauna Hoare, convicted with her boyfriend Nathan Matthews of killing Bristol teenager Becky Watts, could also be affected by the ruling. She claims she knew Matthews wanted to kidnap Becky to have sex with her but was not with him when he throttled her, although she was in the house. The law has been used to put people behind bars when people either ordered or encouraged murder - or when police were unsure exactly who struck the fatal blow in a gang attack or melee. Giving them hope, Lord Neuberger said in a ruling this morning that the law took a 'wrong turn' back in 1984 when 'joint enterprise' was first used. Upset: Naima Ghailan, whose son Sofyen Belamouadden was stabbed to death aged 15 by a 20-strong gang at Victoria in 2010, said today's ruling was 'devastating' for her and the family of other murder victims Hope for the 'joint enterprise' killers: Pictured top left to bottom right: Gary Dobson and David Norris, who were both convicted for the murder of Stephen Lawrence, Samantha Joseph, who acted as a honeytrap to lure in her victim, Shauna Hoare, who was convicted of manslaughter after her boyfriend killed Becky Watts, Stephen Sorton, Jordan Cunliffe and Adam Swellings, who were all jailed for life in January 2008 for the murder of Garry Newlove, and Donald Pemberton, who was involved in a fatal axe attack on New Year's Day last year, could try to appeal their convictions after today's ruling Supreme Court justices said prosecutors, judges and jurors now had to take a different approach when dealing with defendants accused of being involved in joint enterprise crimes. They said it was not right that someone should be guilty merely because they foresaw that a co-accused might commit a crime. WHAT IS JOINT ENTERPRISE? Joint enterprise law was used to convict David Norris and Gary Dobson of killing black teenager Stephen Lawrence. In another well-known case three teenagers, Adam Swellings, Stephen Sorton and Jordan Cunliffe were jailed for life in January 2008 for the murder of Garry Newlove. Mr Newlove was attacked in front of his daughters in August 2007 after he confronted a group outside his house in Warrington, Cheshire. The law allows for several people to be convicted of the same offence, even if they played different roles. It can be used to prosecute all crimes but has recently been mainly used in murder cases. The law means that a gang involved in a fatal attack, who could be standing by encouraging others, can be convicted of murder even if they do not land the fatal blow or kick. Between 2005 and 2013 there were 4,590 prosecutions for murder with two or more defendants, according to a report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. In the same period, 1,853 people were prosecuted for homicides when the charge involved four or more defendants Prosecutors say the law is only used for people who participate in a crime while others have raised concerns about the danger of injustice. Advertisement The panel said jurors should view 'foresight' only as evidence to be taken into account, not as proof of their guilt - and said prosecutors must also work harder to prove intent, they said. Lord Neuberger said: 'The court is satisfied after a much fuller review of the law than in the earlier cases, that the courts took a wrong turn in 1984. And it is the responsibility of this court to put the law right'. But it has struck fear into the families of many victims who now fear that their loved one's killers could seek to appeal their conviction following the case. Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, did say the court's decision 'does not make previous convictions unsafe.' But the judgment, delivered at a hearing in London on Thursday, could lead to hundreds of people convicted under the law launching appeals. Campaign group Jengba - the Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association - hailed the ruling and said it could unlock appeals in 650 other cases. A senior legal source told MailOnline that many appeals could fail if they were not 'convicted on the basis of foresight alone'. Sandra Paul, a solicitor from law firm Kingsley Napley, said the ruling related to a specific facet of the law on joint enterprise and the public should not assume that every case they had read of involving joint enterprise would be affected or result in appeals. She said: 'It relates to cases where people start out doing one thing and then someone does something else. It relates to people foreseeing what someone else will do. 'There are other kinds of joint enterprise cases which this will not affect. The Lawrence case, for example. From what I know of that, this ruling will not affect it. It may be that a lawyer will be asked for advice. But I don't think this ruling would affect it.' But other lawyers believe today's ruling gives hope to killers who may now try to appeal on the basis the situation was 'beyond their control'. Doughty Street Chambers, who helped win today's case, said the Supreme Court claims 'it has not opened the floodgates' but said 'the judgment therefore offers potential hope to many who have already been convicted under joint enterprise'. A spokesman added: 'It seems inevitable, then, that the Court of Appeal Criminal Division will soon have to test the correctness of a number of historic convictions'. Other lawyers admit there will be ramifications in hundreds of cases. A spokesman for Garden Court Chambers in London said: 'The issue now will be how this affects those convicted of serious offences under the doctrine of joint enterprise. It will provide hope to many who have been convicted of serious offences in circumstances where they found themselves caught up in dangerous situations which were beyond their control'. Ruling: Lord Neuberger said in a ruling this morning that the law took a 'wrong turn' back in 1984 Campaigner Deborah Madden said: 'This is a major turning point in British justice. 'The joint enterprise rule has been used to get mass convictions without evidence. It has caused devastation for families.' She added: 'We know of 650 people who we think will be affected by the ruling - and we don't know everyone.' Janet Cunliffe, whose son Jordan received a life sentence for his role in the 2007 murder of Garry Newlove in Warrington, said the ruling meant the law 'will not convict innocent people any more'. Mrs Cunliffe has campaigned to have the law changed since Jordan was ordered to serve at least 12 years for the fatal alcohol-fuelled attack on father-of-three Mr Newlove, 47. Francis FitzGibbon QC, of Doughty Street Chambers, said: 'This decision marks a sea change in a highly controversial area of law. It corrects a historic mistake in the law of joint enterprise, which until now had exposed people to being found guilty of the most serious offences on the weakest legal basis.' In Jogee's case a panel of five Supreme Court justices analysed the issue of joint enterprise at a hearing in London in October when considering an appeal by a man who was convicted of murder after egging on a friend to stab a former policeman. This is a major turning point in British justice. We know of 650 people who we think will be affected by the ruling - and we don't know everyone Anti-joint enterprise campaigner Deborah Madden Ameen Jogee and Mohammed Hirsi, both in their 20s, were given life sentences at Nottingham Crown Court in March 2012 after being convicted of Paul Fyfe's murder. Jurors heard that Hirsi stabbed Mr Fyfe at a house in Leicester in June 2011 while being egged on by Jogee. A judge imposed a minimum 22-year term on Hirsi, who lived in Leicester, and a minimum of 20 years on Jogee, who was of no fixed address. Jogee's minimum term was cut to 18 years by the Court of Appeal. Today Jogee's solicitor, Sandeep Kaushal, said he also thought that around 600 cases could be affected. He said Jogee could be retried for murder or sentenced on the lesser charge of manslaughter. The Supreme Court has now allowed Jogee's appeal against conviction but he will stay in prison while lawyers decide whether he should be retried. Hundreds of convicted criminals including murderers could walk free after the Supreme Court ruled the law of 'joint enterprise' has been wrong interpreted by judges for 30 years. Above, London's Supreme Court Killer of Becky Watts, thugs who kicked Garry Newlove to death on his doorstep and the duo who murdered Stephen Lawrence: All could appeal after Supreme Court ruling The joint enterprise law has been used to convict and hand down long sentences in several high-profile cases. Dozens of people, including those involved in the deaths of Stephen Lawrence, father-of-three Garry Newlove and Pc Neil Doyle, have been put behind bars because of the law. Today's decision does not immediately mean those convicted under joint enterprise will be freed - many cases did not depend on the point of law which was overturned today. But it does open the possibility for future retrials and appeals. The most prominent joint enterprise cases are below. THE THREE TEENAGERS WHO MURDERED GARRY NEWLOVE Adam Swellings, Stephen Sorton and Jordan Cunliffe were all jailed for life in January 2008 for the murder of Mr Newlove, who was kicked to death after he confronted a group outside his house in Warrington, Cheshire. Cunliffe's mother Janet always claimed that although her son was at the scene he did not take part in the 2007 attack. But the teenagers were all convicted as it could not be determined who delivered the fatal blow as the father-of-three's head was 'kicked like a football'. Stephen Sorton left, Jordan Cunliffe centre and Adam Swellings right were all jailed for life in January 2008 for the murder of Garry Newlove, who was kicked to death after he confronted a group outside his house in Warrington, Cheshire Mr Newlove, centre, pictured with his three daughters left to right, Amy, Zoe and Danielle, and his wife Helen STEPHEN LAWRENCE'S MURDERERS: THE DUO WHO LEFT THEIR DNA David Norris and Gary Dobson were both convicted under joint enterprise for the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Mr Lawrence was stabbed to death in a racially-motivated attack while he waited at a bus stop with his friend Duwayne Brooks on April 22, 1993. He was aged just 18 at the time. A letter including the names of potential suspects was left in a telephone box the day after the murder and police subsequently arrested five people, including Norris and Dobson. The other men were Neil and Jamie Acourt, and Luke Knight. David Norris left and Gary Dobson right were both convicted under joint enterprise for the murder of Stephen Lawrence The Crown Prosecution Service dropped charges later in the year after claiming ID evidence given by Mr Brooks was unreliable. A private prosecution was launched in 1994 against Dobson, Knight and Acourt. Video footage showed all three using violent and racist language. But it later collapsed and Met Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon was forced to apologise to the family in 1998 over failures in the case. A review of forensic evidence by police finally led to the trial of Dobson and Norris in May 2011 after the Court of Appeal said there was enough new and substantial evidence. The trial started at the Old Bailey on November 14 the same year. During the trial, the jury heard that Mr Lawrence's DNA was found on the defendant's clothes. Both men were subsequently found guilty of murder, under the law of joint enterprise, and received life sentences. One lawyer said it was unlikely this case would be affected by today's judgment. Mr Lawrence was stabbed to death in a racially-motivated attack while he waited at a bus stop with his friend Duwayne Brooks on April 22, 1993 THE GIRLFRIEND CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER IN THE BECKY WATTS CASE Shauna Hoare was jailed for 17 years after being found guilty of manslaughter following the death of schoolgirl Becky Watts. Becky had been murdered and dismembered by her step-brother Nathan Matthews, who Hoare was in a relationship with, in a sick sexually-motivated attack in February last year. Bristol Crown Court heard that while 28-year-old Matthews physically killed the teenager, Hoare, 21, was in the house and was involved in the plot to 'kidnap' her. The couple had previously messaged about kidnapping petite teenage girls, although in court they said these exchanges were sarcastic. Becky Watts was murdered and dismembered by her step-brother Nathan Matthews right, who Shauna Hoare left was in a relationship with, in a sick sexually-motivated attack in February last year During the trial, the judge asked lawyers to keep up-to-date with the developing joint enterprise ruling. It is also thought if Supreme Court judges had announced their decision earlier, it may have affected the case, according to The Guardian. Both Matthews and Hoare launched appeals against their sentences ahead of today's ruling. Matthews was given a minimum of 33 years. But Hoare's conviction may be unaffected because she was found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. THE MAN WHO WAS FOUND GUILTY AFTER AN AXE ATTACK ON NEW YEAR'S DAY Donald Pemberton was sent to prison after Tanis Bhandari was killed in an axe attack on New Year’s Day last year. Pemberton, along with Ryan Williams, was convicted after the fatal attack in Tamerton Foliot, near Plymouth. Facebook images shown to the jury revealed the friends posed with huge bladed weapons as they prepared for their night. Donald Pemberton left was sent to prison after Tanis Bhandari right was killed in an axe attack on New Year’s Day last year Mr Bhandari was attacked outside the Kings Arms pub later that night. He bled to death after suffering two stab wounds to his back. Pemberton, 21, was jailed for murder and causing grievous bodily harm after a majority jury verdict. He received life with a minimum term of 23 years. His co-accused, Ryan Williams, admitted the joint murder charge and inflicting the fatal blow. Campaign group Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty by Association today said Pemberton's conviction was one of a number of cases they would attempt to overturn using the new ruling. Gloria Morrison, campaign co-ordinator, said: 'If someone did not deliver that fatal blow and didn’t foresee that the person had that intent, then why should he be serving a mandatory life sentence for murder? 'When you explain it like that to people they see it does not make sense. 'The next stop is the appeals and how we use this judgement to get justice for people wrongly convicted - including Donald.' Facebook images shown to the jury revealed the friends posed with huge bladed weapons as they prepared for their night RUSH HOUR STATION ATTACK LED TO BIGGEST-EVER JOINT ENTERPRISE MURDER PROSECUTION A 20-strong group were all charged with murder after a 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death at a central London station during rush hour. Sofyen Belamouadden was chased by the group, which included a number of teenagers, before being stabbed nine times in front of horrified commuters at Victoria station. The youths were said to have coordinated the attack via phone and Facebook. One was carrying a Samurai sword while others were armed with a flick knife, a Swiss army knife, machetes and screwdrivers. A 20-strong group were all charged with murder after 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden pictured was stabbed to death at a central London station during rush hour From left to right: Obi Nwokeh, Christopher Omoregrie and Samson Odegbune were all given life sentences The death resulted in the biggest-ever joint enterprise murder prosecution. Of the group, three were convicted of murder, five of manslaughter and three were cleared. Nine were found guilty of lesser charges. Of those convicted, Obi Nwokeh, Christopher Omoregrie and Samson Odegbune were given life sentences for murder with minimum terms of 18 years. Victoria Osoteku, 20, the only female to be charged, was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter. Legal sources said some of the gang members may have grounds for an appeal following today’s decision if they were convicted under joint enterprise and on the basis of foresight alone.

Helder Demorais, Ricardo Giddings, Jamal Moore and Kyle Kinghorn targeted the teenager as he arrived at Park Campus School in July 2010. They chased him into a nearby garden before attacking him, the Old Bailey heard at the 2011 trail.

THE 15-YEAR-OLD 'HONEYTRAP' WHO LURED A TEEN TO HIS DEATH Samantha Joseph was also convicted for murder after acting as a 'honey trap' to lure 16-year-old Shakilus Townsend to his death in 2008. Joseph, who was 15 at the time, led Shakilus to a quiet cul-de-sac in Thornton Heath, south London, wearing a see-through floral dress. Once there, he was beaten with baseball bats and stabbed six times by her older boyfriend Danny McLean, who was a well-known gang member. Samantha Joseph left was also convicted for murder after acting as a 'honey trap' to lure 16-year-old Shakilus Townsend to his death in 2008. CCTV right showed her wearing a see-through floral dress as she led the besotted teenager to a quiet London cul-de-sac During the trial the Old Bailey heard the victim, who had met Joseph a month earlier and who had told his mother he thought she was beautiful, bled to death after the 'relentless and merciless attack'. Joseph, who was said to have laughed as she walked away after 'delivering' Shakilus to the gang, was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years. THE DUO WHO BEAT AN OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER TO DEATH Just two years ago, football agent Andrew Taylor and sports event manager Timmy Donovan were both convicted of manslaughter by joint enterprise after beating to death off-duty policeman Pc Neil Doyle. Pc Doyle had been at a work night out in Liverpool when he was assaulted by the two men in a 'vicious and sustained attack'. Just two years ago, sports event manager Timmy Donovan left and football agent Andrew Taylor right were both convicted of manslaughter for beating to death off-duty policeman Pc Neil Doyle Pc Doyle had been at a work night out in Liverpool when he was assaulted by the two men in a 'vicious and sustained attack' Neither Taylor nor Donovan admitted throwing the fatal punch, which ruptured Pc Doyle's vertebral artery and caused bleeding in the brain. Both were subsequently jailed. Taylor received seven years and six months while Donovan was sent down for six years and 10 months. Pc Doyle's wife Sarah, who he had only married six months earlier, later said she could never forgive the pair. The manslaughter verdicts in this case make a successful appeal on today's grounds unlikely. Lawyer sister of man convicted of murder under Joint Enterprise rule speaks of 'sheer joy' over Supreme Court ruling A lawyer whose brother was jailed for 19 years for murder under the Joint Enterprise rule has spoken of her 'sheer joy' after the Supreme Court today ruled this law may have been wrongly interpreted for the past 30 years. Alex Henry, now 23, has spent the past two years in two prisons: high-security HMP Pentonville in London and then category A HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire where he is allowed two visits a month. Henry was convicted of murdering 21-year-old Taqui Khezihi in a 'trivial fight' in Ealing Broadway, west London – despite never having touched the knife. Close: Charlotte Henry, campaigning for brother Alex, pictured together, who believes today's ruling will see him freed Henry's friend Cameron Ferguson, then 20, of Southall, pleaded guilty to murder and GBH on the fifth day of the trial in February 2014 after being convicted of issuing the fatal stab wound that killed Taqui Khezihi on August 6, 2013. The jury then found Henry, along with Janhelle Grant-Murray, 20, of Hanwell, guilty of murder, under the Joint Enterprise law. Henry's sister, Brunel University graduate Charlotte Henry, 26, mother, Sally Halsall, 49, and stepfather, Geoff Halsall, 55, joined the Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty by Association JENGbA campaign following Henry's conviction at the Old Bailey in March 2014. Crime: Henry was convicted of murdering 21-year-old Taqui Khezihi in a 'trivial fight' in Ealing Broadway, west London – despite never having touched the knife. Miss Henry said: 'For the Supreme Court to say the law that convicted your brother was unjust- I can't put into words how completely lifted and overjoyed I feel. 'To have the biggest court in England and Wales say you were right- I burst into tears straight away. 'It was just sheer joy. It gives everyone who is part of JENGbA so much hope. We have been fighting for justice for years, after all the pain that many families have been through. 'To go from 2013 when Alex was first charged with murder and people thinking your brother is a murderer, to now, is so emotional. 'It was not just the trauma of not being able to see my brother, it was the label 'murderer.' 'As a family, we have gone through many ups and downs, mainly downs. We have been really struggling to cope and remain positive. 'Being a trainee lawyer has given me strength to be able to understand the enemy.' Miss Henry said she has coped over the last couple of years while her brother has been in prison by pushing aside the grief, but today the emotion has resurfaced for her family and many others. 'It brings back all the fighting we have done to get to this point.' she said. Alex Henry will now be appealing his conviction, and Miss Henry has her hopes set on getting her brother back. She said: 'My biggest hope is that he will be acquitted and that we get Alex back home. 'Second to that would be for his conviction to be replaced with affray or violent disorder, for which he may have already served enough time in jail. 'Obviously we wish none of this had happened and the judges had previously made the right decision but that's the nature of common law, law that evolves throughout time with each judgement handed down by the court. 'Hopefully lessons have been learnt.' She told how Alex was always a funny and lively character. Miss Henry's life was put on hold after her brother's conviction and she was unemployed for about seven months. 'I had to leave my job as a probation officer at the London Probation Trust a week before the trial because I needed to be there for him every day. 'I was left without my brother, unemployed and traumatised by the whole process. 'I thought I should do a postgraduate in law after the conviction because I was worried at one point we might not be able to afford a lawyer and I knew I had to understand it completely to be able to fight it. 'That led me to train as a criminal defence solicitor, which I began doing with Achom and Partners in Finsbury Park, a month ago.'",Climate Change Wackos Exposed in California Court,partially false
3fb9f568,"Opinion: Pandemics and freedom — finding balance As a state representative, I have had a front-row seat for Missouri’s response to the coronavirus threat. We made significant preparations to cope with the influx of patients and said our prayers that social distancing and the shelter in place orders would “flatten the curve” sufficiently to save lives and save us from the worst-case scenario nightmare predictions of millions dead nationwide. It has been greatly encouraging to hear from our governor and public health officials on a daily basis that we have mobilized vast resources, provided millions of dollars for equipment that our health care providers and first responders need to keep them safe while they tend to our sick, cut through red tape to make sure that intended recipients get what they should in record time, made sure that our food supply is safe, and have taken common-sense precautions to keep the “curve” as flat as a molehill when compared to the mountains experienced in other countries. Thankfully, we have seen success to date, as nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases. It is also gratifying to see the private and nonprofit sectors do what they always do — help in as many ways as possible as quickly as possible to help those in need, starting with distributing food and assisting businesses with the application process to access government resources without further delay. The U.S. has never shut its economy down before on such a scale on purpose. We are in uncharted waters, and it has been gratifying to see how many Americans have risen to the challenge selflessly, starting with our health care workers and first responders, our schools, and our businesses that are enduring hardships unimaginable six months ago. On the other hand, I have seen the worst, starting with the morons in neighboring states who stockpiled hand sanitizers to sell at radically marked up prices online, raids on toilet paper based on some manner of wisdom that has so far escaped me, and the most galling of all, panic selling by allegedly intelligent financial wizards who manage to detonate trillions of dollars in market value on a daily basis because their quarterly numbers are not going so well — despite the undisputed knowledge that “this too shall pass.” If this lunacy continues, our retirement accounts will need another 10 years of contributions before we can comfortably leave the workforce. I have also spent more time than I would like knocking down nasty rumors that would only make a bad situation worse and plowing through red tape and Catch-22s that have still managed to survive. Another troubling development: We have been inundated with breathless, non-stop reporting about the numbers who have contracted the virus and those who have died here and worldwide, dutifully updated faster than the financial news updates stock prices. On the other side of that equation, context is sorely lacking: Nowhere near equal time has been given to the stories of those who have contracted the virus and lived through it, which is in fact the vast majority of those who have been sickened. We have had celebrities sickened by the virus — Tom Hanks and Boris Johnson come to mind immediately. Both survived and are on the mend. The folks in the mass media have been inexplicably restrained about dispensing hope by sharing the good news that the U.S. has a remarkably low death rate per thousand of confirmed cases — which is even less than advertised since there are probably millions among us who have had the virus, thought it was something else, and came through unharmed. I will not hold my breath that the mass media will change its tactics any time soon. As a state representative, I also have to think ahead to the lessons to be learned from this pandemic and how to best apply them at both the policy and appropriations levels. These are a few of the items I am contemplating at the moment. First, how do we — if possible — stop or severely curtail the damage to our people physically and economically as a result of viruses that sweep the globe with alarming regularity? Since China appears to be the world’s leading petri dish for brewing viruses that kill animals as well as humans and reportedly facilitates the jump of viruses from animals to humans through the ingestion of such critters as bats and pangolins available through so-called “wet markets,” do we need to permanently medically screen all travelers from China before we allow them to disembark from planes or ships when we know that this virus has as long as a two-week fuse? We wait in long lines at airports now for the TSA to make sure that all of us are not terrorists. The coronavirus has killed a lot more people than terrorists and shaved trillions off our economy, damage that terrorists can only dream of. For added context, anyone who believes that China is our “friend” has ignored that it is a totalitarian state that has lied through its collectivist teeth about the origins of this virus and fanned on the opportunity to contain it locally in Wuhan, has “relocated” at least 1 million Uighurs into “re-education” camps to cure them of their religious beliefs, has engaged in industrial espionage (and outright intellectual property theft) on a scale never seen before in human history, has invested trillions in infrastructure to control the economic destiny of Asia, all while instituting a “social credit system” designed to enforce domestic “conformity” of more than 1 billion people using Orwellian facial recognition technology to do so (or else). Khruschev told the West he would “bury” us and took off his shoe and banged it on a table at the U.N. to get our attention; China’s President for Life, i.e., Dictator, Xi, has spared us the histrionics and has instead put our trade deficit money to work to bury us quietly, slowly and surely. Before the dawn of the 20th century, American policy going back to John Hay’s Open Door Notes nearly 125 years ago was predicated on the notion that Chinese consumers would purchase American products in vast quantities and make us rich as a result. The exact opposite has happened. Missouri alone now imports more than $4 billion in goods from China. That represents 20 percent of all the imports in Missouri. China, in turn, buys $700 million of our goods, for a trade deficit in Missouri alone of more than $3.2 billion. We have seen the folly of chasing after the lowest possible price over the last 30 years: The result has been the hollowing out of our manufacturing sector, which devastated the Midwest. We have plenty of empty buildings to show you in Hannibal that are monuments to short-sighted trade policies that gave away our manufacturing birthright. Our farmers are also feeling the pain of the unpredictability of Chinese markets. At least 25 percent of Chinese hogs have been killed by the latest outbreak of swine flu — probably twice that, considering that China is not renowned for telling the truth about bad news (see coronavirus bald-faced lies above). Those hogs will take years to replace; meanwhile, the soybeans they consumed as feedstocks will not be headed to China any time soon. We literally cannot afford to wait for them to repopulate their swine herds. Charity begins at home. And so does sustained prosperity. Second, the damage to our economy due to supply chain interruptions from around the globe — primarily China and Japan, but also including Europe — must be examined. Just-in-time delivery is the cornerstone of lean manufacturing, but global disruptions such as this are yet another reminder that globalization is fine and dandy when it works, but craters national economies when it does not. We reroute commerce across Missouri and the Midwest when we are confronted with floods, but this is something different altogether — global supply chains rely on products that begin their transit oceans away, not from neighboring states. The more we make in America, the less we have to rely on products coming in from overseas. And will someone explain the rationale for outsourcing so much of our prescription drug production to China? What corporate geniuses decided that would be in our best interest as a nation? What happens when that supply chain “breaks,” or China decides to sell prescription meds to others? We should be smart enough to never find out that answer, starting today. Third: When will we start treating broadband internet as infrastructure, every bit as critical to our daily lives as roads, bridges, and electricity? Millions of Americans have been instructed to work from home as a result of this pandemic, and corporations will be evaluating the effectiveness of that approach to their bottom lines. Many of us anticipate that the expedient will become the norm since remote workers cut down on overhead expenses. Working remotely is fine and good if you have the internet capability to do so, but nearly 1 million Missourians in rural areas do not. The same goes for the expanded access to telemedicine announced at the federal level — great for those who have it, irrelevant for those who do not. Imagine how many fewer cases of the flu we would deal with on an annual basis if patients could be diagnosed and treated from home and not have to share their sickness with the general public in the first place. Millions of American students are being told to log on to their portals for online instruction while their schools are closed, but that is not an option for far too many of Missouri’s rural school students — an estimated 20,000 Missouri high school seniors alone this year have no such access at the most critical moment of the year: just before graduation. Virtual education is there in statute and with us in spirit, but does not happen for students who live outside of town. Finally, we have seen multiple excesses regarding the most routine of civil rights: a governor who has forbidden planting vegetables in family gardens and a mayor taking license plate numbers at drive-in church services like the FBI at a mob boss funeral are two of the most disturbing examples. If there is a “second round” of this virus in the fall and there is no vaccine available for all of us, we are going to have to make hard choices about how far is too far. Hopefully sooner rather than later, we will take a hard look at the lessons learned from how we handled our response to the coronavirus at the beginning of the 21st century’s “Roaring Twenties.” My prayer is that we all not only survive this pandemic but also find ways to take the sting out of the next inevitable wave of sickness that will wash over our shores in the coming months and years. Knowledge without application is useless. This is the ultimate teachable moment. We literally cannot afford to ignore it.

a59f000e,"MPs have voted to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales. MPs have backed a bill by 172 votes in favour, versus 142 against. The bill, which was introduced as a Ten-Minute rule bill, will now go to a second reading on 24th March, before it can be passed into law. ✕ The UK's own abortion ban, explained in 3 minutes In 1967, the Abortion Act was passed which made terminations legal subject to doctors' approval and if a pregnant person can prove they meet predetermined criteria. However, critics say the law does not go far enough as people who do not meet these conditions who have an abortion are committing a criminal offence. It is thought the growing availability of online abortion pills is increasing the number of terminations women have in the UK, outside of official, licensed clinics. In addition, women are committing an offence if they have a termination after the 24-week limit. Labour MP Diana Johnson introduced the debate to the House of Commons, which calls for full decriminalisation. She told MPs: There is no other medical procedure in this country is governed by legislation this old, this out of step with medical developments and public attitudes. Doctors are poorly served by a criminal framework which does not apply to other areas of medicine. The bill is backed by the Royal College of Midwives and the British Pregnancy Advisory service. However, anti-abortion groups say the move could result in more abortions taking place. They say it could result in abortions taking place at later dates, or gender selective abortions occurring.

38a5453c,"Dan O’Donnell dives into new data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission that shows a stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots this November. February 3, 2021 Perspective by Dan O’Donnell Calling into question any aspect of November’s presidential election is a dangerous proposition these days. One is liable to be banned from social media or blamed for a riot at the U.S. Capitol even for suggesting that there might be irregularities that warrant further investigation. It is, however, far from conspiracy-mongering to accept the reality that those in charge of administering state elections here in Wisconsin put their thumb on the scales at every conceivable opportunity. The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) violated state law by refusing to remove 234,000 names from the voter rolls and by keeping both Kanye West and the Green Party off the ballot so that they could not serve as spoilers for eventual winner Joe Biden. Milwaukee and Dane County clerks violated state law by telling voters that they could claim indefinite confinement (and thus avoid voter ID requirements) even if they themselves were not actually confined to their homes. The City of Madison violated state law by holding a ballot harvesting event (for which the Biden campaign actually advertised) in every one of its city parks. Now it seems likely that elections officials across the state refused to reject ballots that they normally would have (and probably legally should have). The WEC’s newly released Election Data Report reveals a staggering anomaly that is nearly impossible to otherwise explain: Despite a massive increase in the use of mail-in voting this November, the percentage of ballots that were rejected dropped to nearly zero. Just 4,270 absentee ballots out of 1,969,274 cast were rejected—a rate of 0.2%. This defies both logic and common sense. In November’s presidential election, there were roughly twice as many absentee ballots cast as in the spring 2016 election, yet in that election four years ago the rejection rate was 2.5%. If far more people were casting absentee ballots (and presumably casting them for the first time), it would stand to reason that the number of mistakes which cause ballots to be rejected would increase as well. Instead, those mistakes all but vanished. An infinitesimal 0.07% of ballots (1,434 in total) were rejected because of insufficient ballot certification. An even smaller 0.05% (1,045 total) were rejected because they were received after polls closed. And a microscopic 0.002% (just 42 total) were rejected because the ballot envelope was somehow compromised. This is nearly impossible to explain, especially since the ballot rejection rate was 1.8% just seven months earlier in Wisconsin’s spring election, when a then-record 1,101,474 absentee ballots were cast. Despite a 78% increase in the number of absentee ballots cast in November, there was a 78% decrease in the number of ballots that were rejected. Did hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites suddenly figure out how to correctly fill out their ballots? Or was there a concerted effort to count as many ballots as possible without regard to whether they were correctly filled out? The evidence points toward the latter. The ballot rejection rate in the April 2016 presidential primary was 2.5% with a 1.4% rejection rate the following November even though there were far fewer absentee ballots returned than in the 2020 presidential election cycle. The April 2020 rejection rate was well within the normal range at 1.8%, but then it suddenly dipped to a minuscule 0.2%. Interestingly enough, in the November 2018 gubernatorial election—which was also dogged by allegations of fraud following a sudden influx of absentee votes in Milwaukee that propelled Governor Tony Evers past Scott Walker—the absentee ballot rejection rate suddenly dropped to 0.2%. What exactly would be the odds that ballots suddenly stopped getting rejected in the two statewide races in which unpopular Republicans (Walker and Donald Trump) were on the ballot and both lost because of huge increases in absentee voting? Given that the Wisconsin Elections Commission has since 2016 been unlawfully telling local clerks to fix problematic ballots instead of returning them to voters as state statutes require, it seems as though it has been WEC policy (unlawful though it may be) to get as many questionable ballots counted as possible. This, however, doesn’t explain the sudden and dramatic dips in ballot rejection rates only in the 2018 gubernatorial and 2020 presidential elections. Either voters somehow figured out ballot return rules exceptionally well only in those two races or clerks and poll workers had a concerted effort to reject as few ballots as possible in an unlawful attempt at aiding Democrat challengers in their bid to unseat Republican incumbents whom the clerks and poll workers despised. Either way, this stunningly low rejection rate with a record number of mail-in ballots demands and immediate and thorough investigation.",Justine Greening quits government after refusing offer of new role,FALSE

Martin Sandoval with accepting a bribe in exchange for opposing legislation that would harm the red-light camera industry. They also charged him with one count of filing a false income tax return. Silent Sean Casten, once again, failed to stand up to his party bosses in Illinois. Just as he refused to stand up to Mike Madigan and his cronies when it was learned that they allegedy covered up a rape and fostered a culture of abuse in Springfield, Casten has said nothing about Marty Sandoval’s bribery changes. When Sandoval staged a mock assassination of the President at a fundraiser in the 6th district, Casten said nothing. Yet, he demanded the impeachment of the Republican President before the Mueller report was even released. And he couldn’t have been quicker to hype the impeachment of Conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on completely bogus allegations. Then, Casten turns around and tells a group of voters, “Because we are still a nation where the majority of people voted for Hillary Clinton, we are still a nation where the majority are good people.” Hillary Clinton’s career is easily one of the most well-documented cases of political corruption in American History. “Now, I understand Sean Casten may feel a little sheepish commenting on another Democrat’s tax fraud, since it was recently revealed that Casten himself was committing tax fraud,” said Jeanne Ives. “Ignoring corruption and refusing to use your platform to expose wrong-doing might keep you in favor with party bosses, but it also makes you complicit in your party’s culture of abuse. Worse still, going after the wrong-doings of your political opponents with the energy of 1,000 solar-powered windmills, while ignoring the serious problems in your own party, makes you a bitter partisan.” As a state representative, Ives spoke out against Speaker Madigan’s culture of cronyism and abuse.

4905a5f5,"The CO2 error is the root of the biggest scam in the history of the world, and has already bilked nations and citizens out of trillions of dollars, while greatly enriching the perpetrators. In the end, their goal is global Technocracy (aka Sustainable Development), which grabs and sequesters all the resources of the world into a collective trust to be managed by them. TN Editor The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) claim of human-caused global warming (AGW) is built on the assumption that an increase in atmospheric CO2 causes an increase in global temperature. The IPCC claim is what science calls a theory, a hypothesis, or in simple English, a speculation. Every theory is based on a set of assumptions. The standard scientific method is to challenge the theory by trying to disprove it. Karl Popper wrote about this approach in a 1963 article, Science as Falsification. Douglas Yates said, “No scientific theory achieves public acceptance until it has been thoroughly discredited.” Thomas Huxley made a similar observation.
“The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority, as such. For him, skepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin.” In other words, all scientists must be skeptics, which makes a mockery out of the charge that those who questioned AGW, were global warming skeptics. Michael Shermer provides a likely explanation for the effectiveness of the charge.“Scientists are skeptics. It’s unfortunate that the word ‘skeptic’ has taken on other connotations in the culture involving nihilism and cynicism. Really, in its pure and original meaning, it’s just thoughtful inquiry.” The scientific method was not used with the AGW theory. In fact, the exact opposite occurred, they tried to prove the theory. It is a treadmill guaranteed to make you misread, misrepresent, misuse and selectively choose data and evidence. This is precisely what the IPCC did and continued to do. A theory is used to produce results. The results are not wrong, they are only as right as the assumptions on which they are based. For example, Einstein used his theory of relativity to produce the most famous formula in the world; e = mc2. You cannot prove it wrong mathematically because it is the end product of the assumptions he made. To test it and disprove it, you challenge one or all of the assumptions. One of these is represented by the letter “c” in the formula, which assumes nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. Scientists challenging the theory are looking for something moving faster than the speed of light. The most important assumption behind the AGW theory is that an increase in global atmospheric CO2 will cause an increase in the average annual global temperature. The problem is that in every record of temperature and CO2, the temperature changes first. Think about what I am saying. The basic assumption on which the entire theory that human activity is causing global warming or climate change is wrong. The questions are how did the false assumption develop and persist? The answer is the IPCC needed the assumption as the basis for their claim that humans were causing catastrophic global warming for a political agenda. They did what all academics do and found a person who gave historical precedence to their theory. In this case, it was the work of Svante Arrhenius. The problem is he didn’t say what they claim. Anthony Watts’ 2009 article identified many of the difficulties with relying on Arrhenius. The Friends of Science added confirmation when they translated a more obscure 1906 Arrhenius work. They wrote, Much discussion took place over the following years between colleagues, with one of the main points being the similar effect of water vapour in the atmosphere which was part of the total figure. Some rejected any effect of CO2 at all. There was no effective way to determine this split precisely, but in 1906 Arrhenius amended his view of how increased carbon dioxide would affect climate. The issue of Arrhenius mistaking a water vapor effect for a CO2 effect is not new. What is new is that the growing level of empirical evidence that the warming effect of CO2, known as climate sensitivity, is zero. This means Arrhenius colleagues who “rejected any effect of CO2 at all” are correct. In short, CO2 is not a greenhouse gas. The IPCC through the definition of climate change given them by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) were able to predetermine their results. a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over considerable time periods. This allowed them to only examine human-causes, thus eliminating almost all other variables of climate and climate change. You cannot identify the human portion if you don’t know or understand natural, that is without human, climate or climate change. IPCC acknowledged this in 2007 as people started to ask questions about the narrowness of their work. They offered the one that many people thought they were using and should have been using. Deceptively, it only appeared as a footnote in the 2007 Summary for Policymakers (SPM), so it was aimed at the politicians. It said, “Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.” Few at the time challenged the IPCC assumption that an increase in CO2 caused an increase in global temperature. The IPCC claimed it was true because when they increased CO2 in their computer models, the result was a temperature increase. Of course, because the computer was programmed for that to happen. These computer models are the only place in the world where a CO2 increase precedes and causes a temperature change. This probably explains why their predictions are always wrong. An example of how the definition allowed the IPCC to focus on CO2 is to consider the major greenhouse gases by name and percentage of the total. They are water vapour (H20) 95%, carbon dioxide (CO2) 4%, and methane (CH4) 0.036%. The IPCC was able to overlook water vapor (95%) by admitting humans produce some, but the amount is insignificant relative to the total atmospheric volume of water vapour. The human portion of the CO2 in the atmosphere is approximately 3.4% of the total CO2 (Figure 1) To put that in perspective, approximately a 2% variation in water vapour completely overwhelms the human portion of CO2. This is entirely possible because water vapour is the most variable gas in the atmosphere, from region to region and over time. Figure 1 In 1999, after two IPCC Reports were produced in 1990 and 1995 assuming a CO2 increase caused a temperature increase, the first significant long term Antarctic ice core record appeared. Petit, Raynaud, and Lorius were presented as the best representation of levels of temperature, CO2, and deuterium over 420,000-years. It appeared the temperature and CO2 were rising and falling in concert, so the IPCC and others assumed this proved that CO2 was causing temperature variation. I recall Lorius warning against rushing to judgment and saying there was no indication of such a connection. Euan Mearns noted in his robust assessment that the authors believed that temperature increase preceded CO2 increase. In their seminal paper on the Vostok Ice Core, Petit et al (1999) [1] note that CO2 lags temperature during the onset of glaciations by several thousand years but offer no explanation. They also observe that CH4 and CO2 are not perfectly aligned with each other but offer no explanation. The significance of these observations are therefore ignored. At the onset of glaciations temperature drops to glacial values before CO2 begins to fall suggesting that CO2 has little influence on temperature modulation at these times. Lorius reconfirmed his position in a 2007 article. “our [East Antarctica, Dome C] ice core shows no indication that greenhouse gases have played a key role in such a coupling [with radiative forcing]” Despite this, those promoting the IPCC claims ignored the empirical evidence. They managed to ignore the facts and have done so to this day. Joanne Nova explains part of the reason they were able to fool the majority in her article, “The 800 year lag in CO2 after temperature – graphed.” when she wrote confirming the Lorius concern. “It’s impossible to see a lag of centuries on a graph that covers half a million years, so I have regraphed the data from the original sources…” Nova concluded after expanding and more closely examining the data that, The bottom line is that rising temperatures cause carbon levels to rise. Carbon may still influence temperatures, but these ice cores are neutral on that. If both factors caused each other to rise significantly, positive feedback would become exponential. We’d see a runaway greenhouse effect. It hasn’t happened. Some other factor is more important than carbon dioxide, or carbon’s role is minor. Al Gore knew the ice core data showed temperature changing first. In his propaganda movie, An Inconvenient Truth he separated the graph of temperature and CO2 enough to make a comparison of the two graphs more difficult. He then distracted with Hollywood histrionics by riding up on a forklift to the distorted 20th century reading. Thomas Huxley said, “The great tragedy of science – the slaying of a lovely hypothesis by an ugly fact.” The most recent ugly fact was that after 1998 CO2 levels continued to increase but global temperatures stopped increasing. Other ugly facts included the return of cold, snowy winters creating a PR problem by 2004. Cartoons appeared (Figure 2.) Figure 2 The people controlling the AGW deception were aware of what was happening. Emails from 2004 leaked from the University of East Anglia revealed the concern. Nick at the Minns/Tyndall Centre that handled publicity for the climate story said, “In my experience, global warming freezing is already a bit of a public relations problem with the media.” Swedish climate expert on the IPCC Bo Kjellen replied, “I agree with Nick that climate change might be a better labelling than global warming.” The disconnect between atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperatures continued after 1998. The level of deliberate blindness of what became known as the “pause” or the hiatus became ridiculous (Figure 3). Figure 3 The assumption that an increase in CO2 causes an increase in temperature was incorrectly claimed in the original science by Arrhenius. He mistakenly attributed the warming caused by water vapour (H2O) to CO2. All the evidence since confirms the error. This means CO2 is not a greenhouse gas. There is a greenhouse effect, and it is due to the water vapour. The entire claim that CO and especially human CO2 is absolutely wrong, yet these so-called scientists convinced the world to waste trillions on reducing CO2.

40a2b728,"Border patrol vehicles near the Rio Grande, where officers patrol for people crossing into the U.S. from Mexico early this week. The pictures of migrant children being separated from their parents at the border are heartbreaking. But what I find even more heartbreaking is the entire humanitarian crisis at the southern border. The root of the crisis is lax enforcement of our immigration laws, a problem that didn’t start under President Trump. In fact, the biggest reason for the crisis is that previous administrations pursued a “catch and release” policy for those seeking asylum after illegally crossing our borders. When migrants are prosecuted for illegal entry and plead guilty, the proceedings are short - often within the same day. After, they are quickly reunited with their children. Where things get complicated is when a migrant in criminal proceedings files an asylum claim. In that scenario, they are detained for a longer period of time than the government is legally allowed to hold them with their children.
The reason for that is a ruling by the liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals known as the Flores Settlement. This ruling prohibits the government from detaining alien children for more than 20 days. Even if the government wants to detain a family together, it’s legally forbidden from doing so. Because of the Flores Settlement, and subsequent court decisions, the Obama Administration doubled down on the policy to release parents in asylum proceedings who were accompanied by children. The results were predictable: From 2012 to 2017, asylum claims from Central America soared almost 900 percent. Not surprisingly, the “catch and release” policy incentivized migrants to bring children into the U.S. to avoid detention. It also incentivized parents to send their children with other adults so they could claim asylum as a family unit at the border, even while their parents stayed home. The unintended consequences of “catch and release” are tragic: An exponential increase in illegal immigration; numerous children abused; countless women raped; and untold numbers of men and women killed, drowned, starved or dead of dehydration in the perilous journey to the U.S. What makes these tragedies so unnecessary is there’s already a process in place for those who are legitimately seeking asylum. They can show up at any embassy or consulate abroad or any U.S. port of entry to make their asylum claims. Tellingly, these migrants refuse to make their claims at designated points and continue to pour into our country illegally. This strongly suggests that most migrants are coming to the U.S. for economic reasons, not because they have valid claims of persecution. The Trump Administration, to its credit, wants to solve the immigration crisis. In an effort to discourage migrant families and children from embarking on this treacherous journey, the administration started prosecuting all adults illegally crossing the border, instead of giving a free pass to adults who arrived with children. This led to over 2,000 alien children being temporarily detained away from adults. This, in turn, caused the media firestorm that brought Washington to a standstill. What’s interesting is that many in the media conveniently forgot that the Obama Administration also separated families at the border. At least the Idaho Statesman got it right when it ran a story last week titled, “Yes, Obama separated families at the border, too.” In 2014, when the crisis started under President Obama, the Idaho media was largely silent about this issue. The government continued to separate families in 2015, 2016, and 2017. But when President Trump took steps to end “catch and release,” there was an explosion of media interest. I support President Trump’s policy to prosecute those who are violating our immigration laws. I also support his executive order from June 20 that keeps migrant families together while directing the government’s lawyers to ask for a modification of the Flores Settlement. I have worked with my House colleagues on legislation that would keep migrant families together without reverting to the failed “catch and release” policy. The bill we propose would also close loopholes in asylum law to curb fraud and abuse. This will reduce illegal crossings, while also protecting those who have legitimate asylum claims. My proposed solution is supported by the majority of the American people. In a recent CBS News poll, 63 percent of Americans support keeping families together through better enforcement of our immigration laws. Only 21 percent support the “catch and release” policy advocated by Democrats and the liberal media.
Fixing our broken immigration system was President Trump’s No. 1 promise to the American people in the 2016 election. It’s also the No. 1 issue I’ve worked on as a member of Congress, and I will continue to work on it until my last day in office. I am committed to working with President Trump to keep families together and to make our entire country stronger and safer.

The new serological data, which is provisional, suggests that coronavirus infections greatly outnumber confirmed covid-19 cases, potentially by a factor of 10 or more. Many people experience mild symptoms or none at all, and never get the standard diagnostic test with a swab up the nose, so they’re missed in the official covid-19 case counts. Higher infection rates mean lower lethality risk on average. But the corollary is that this is a very contagious disease capable of being spread by people who are asymptomatic — a challenge for communities hoping to end their shutdowns. The crude case fatality rates, covering people who have a covid-19 diagnosis, have been about 6 percent globally as well as in the United States. But when all the serological data is compiled and analyzed, the fatality rate among people who have been infected could be less than 1 percent. But as infectious disease experts point out, even a seemingly low rate can translate into a shockingly large death toll if the virus spreads through a major portion of the population. [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said Monday that the latest antibody numbers in New York City indicate that 25 percent of the population of 8.8 million has already been infected. The city has recorded more than 12,000 confirmed covid-19 deaths, and lists another 5,000 as probable deaths. That is an infection fatality rate between 0.5 and 0.8 percent, depending on which death toll is factored in. (A spike in all-cause deaths in recent weeks also suggests that some coronavirus-related deaths have not been captured by mortality statistics.) “The death rate is much, much lower,” Cuomo said Monday, referring to the serology tests. He said the New York state rate appears to be 0.5 percent — which is one death per 200 infections. That figure is still sobering to infectious disease experts. A rate of 0.5 percent “is way more than a usual flu season and I would think way more than the ’57 or 1968 [influenza] pandemic death toll, too,” Viboud said. This is a novel, highly infectious virus, and so everyone who hasn’t had an infection is presumably susceptible. It is unclear whether and for how long a person who recovers from covid-19 will have immunity. Research shows that, in a completely vulnerable population that takes no precautions, each infected person will infect well more than two others on average, and some estimates put that reproduction number over three.  Epidemiologists have said somewhere between 40 to 70 percent of the population will likely become infected in the next couple of years if there is no vaccine and the public does not take aggressive measures to limit the spread of the virus. “Do the math!” said Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist who has been studying the coronavirus since early in the outbreak. Shaman and his colleagues have developed a model of the coronavirus spread that estimates that only 1 in 12 infections in the United States have been documented in official counts. That leads to an infection fatality rate of 0.6 percent, he said — a figure that roughly matches what has been seen in New York City. At that rate, the United States could potentially experience 1 million deaths if half the population became infected and no efforts were made to limit the contagion through social distancing, a vaccine or proven therapeutics, Shaman said. “That’s 20 times worse than a bad flu season,” he said Monday. This is obviously a highly politicized pandemic, and some critics of the nationwide shutdown have seized on this early antibody data to argue that covid-19 isn’t all that deadly. A common refrain is that the disease is not significantly worse than the flu. In this view, the pandemic threat has been wildly exaggerated. “Pandemic Is Over. Let’s Stop the Economic Suicide, and Get Back to Work,” declared a headline on a column by free market advocate George Gilder on the RealClearMarkets website. He said policies to control the viral spread “should be reversed summarily and acknowledged to be a mistake, perpetrated by statisticians with erroneous computer models.” Kevin McCullough, a columnist for the conservative website Town Hall, wrote a column that ran last week with the headline “Antibody Testing: Proves We’ve Been Had!” “Nearly everything we’ve been told about models, rates of infection, deaths, and recoveries was inaccurate,” he wrote. “The death rate in New York State isn’t 7.4%, it is actually .75%.” But the two numbers describe different things: The first is a case fatality rate, reflecting deaths among people with confirmed diagnoses of covid-19. The second is the infection fatality rate, extrapolated from the antibody surveys. In other words, both numbers can be correct, and useful. “Those higher numbers of case fatality rates, they’re still true,” Viboud said. “It’s your probability of dying if you’re clinically sick with it, which is something that people may care about, too.” Moreover, the fatality rate of a virus, however it is defined, is not an innate feature of the pathogen. It depends on many variables, including the age and health of the population and access to health care. Timing matters, too: In China the fatality rate was high during the initial phase of the outbreak, when hospitals were overwhelmed and doctors struggled to cope with the crisis. AD There are so many numbers flying around that it is understandable that people may struggle to make sense of them. That’s become even more difficult in recent days due to serological studies that haven’t been peer-reviewed but have been presented to the public, typically with dramatic public health conclusions attached. The most controversial such study came out of Santa Clara County, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley. It claimed that the true number of infections in the county in early April may have been 50 to 85 times the official coronavirus case counts. Extrapolating from that, it gave an estimated infection fatality rate of between 0.12 and 0.2 percent. That provided what seemed like reliable ammunition to those who believe the danger of covid-19 has been overstated. They said the numbers show this disease is not much different from seasonal flu. AD A commonly cited statistic about seasonal flu is that it has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, That, however, is a case fatality rate. The infection fatality rate for flu is perhaps only half that, Viboud said. Shaman estimated that it’s about one-quarter the case fatality rate. Thus, even if the Santa Clara numbers are roughly accurate about the spread of the virus and its lethality, it would still be deadlier than the flu. Statisticians and other epidemiologists have argued that there were also errors in data analysis in the Santa Clara report, which was led by researchers at Stanford University. The researchers used advertisements on Facebook to call for volunteers, and critics said that may have led to an unrepresentative sampling of the county. The critics noted that even a small rate of false positives can skew a survey in which the targeted disease has low prevalence. AD Shaman, the epidemiologist, said he hopes the higher estimates for infections and commensurately lower fatality rates are correct. Everyone needs more testing and better data, he said. For now, the preponderance of evidence describes an exceptional pathogen. For someone like Shaman, who wears a mask when he walks the dog in New York City and is conscientious about washing his hands, there is no doubt that the endgame is far away — that until a vaccine or reliable therapeutics are in place, or when so many people have been sickened and then recovered that the country achieves “herd immunity,” everyone needs to try to limit the spread of the virus. “We have completely disrupted our society through our social distancing practices, shutting our businesses, closing our schools, and still this thing has already killed 53,000 people in the United States,” he said. “We have a very long way to go until we get herd immunity.”",FALSE

2fd36b76,"BELORECHENSK, Russia (Reuters) - Ten Russian servicemen have been killed fighting in Syria so far this year, according to statements from the Defence Ministry. A portrait of Russian private military contractor Yevgeni Chuprunov is seen at his grave in Novomoskovsk, in Tula region, Russia June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Maria Tsvetkova But based on accounts from families and friends of the dead and local officials, Reuters estimates the actual death toll among Russian soldiers and private contractors was at least 40. That tally over seven months exceeds the 36 Russian armed personnel and contractors estimated by Reuters to have been killed in Syria over the previous 15 months, indicating a significant rise in the rate of battlefield losses as the country’s involvement deepens. Most of the deaths reported by Reuters have been confirmed by more than one person, including those who knew the deceased or local officials. In nine cases, Reuters corroborated a death reported in local or social media with another source. The data may be on the conservative side, as commanders encourage the families of those killed to keep quiet, relatives and friends of several fallen soldiers, both servicemen and contractors, said on condition of anonymity. The true level of casualties in the Syrian conflict is a sensitive subject in a country where positive coverage of the conflict features prominently in the media and ahead of a presidential election next year that incumbent Vladimir Putin is expected to win. The scale of Russian military casualties in peace time has been a state secret since Putin issued a decree three months before Russia launched its operation in Syria. While Russia does not give total casualties, it does disclose some deaths. Discrepancies in data may be explained partly by the fact that Russia does not openly acknowledge that private contractors fight alongside the army; their presence in Syria would appear to flout a legal ban on civilians fighting abroad as mercenaries. Asked about Reuters’ latest findings, the Defence Ministry did not respond. Infographic ID: '2hjq3Et' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Russians private citizens fighting alongside the Syrian army are volunteers and the Russian Defence Ministry did not send them to Syria. “If there are Russian citizens in Syria as volunteers and so on, they have nothing to do with the state,” Peskov said in response to a question about the Reuters story on a daily conference call with media. The government has previously denied understating casualty figures in Syria, where Moscow entered the conflict nearly two years ago in support of President Bashar al-Assad, one of its closest Middle East allies. Months after soldiers die, Russia quietly acknowledges some losses, including private military contractors. Their families get state posthumous medals and local authorities sometimes name schools, which fallen soldiers attended as children, after them. Of the 40 killed, Reuters has evidence that 21 were private contractors and 17 soldiers. The status of the remaining two people is unclear. MISSION CREEP? Little is known about the nature of operations in Syria involving Russian nationals. Russia initially focused on providing air support to Syrian forces, but the rate of casualties points to more ground intervention. The last time Russia lost airmen in Syria was in August, 2016, and it suffered its first serious casualties on the ground this year in January, when six private military contractors died in one day. Reuters has previously reported gaps between its casualty estimates and official figures, although the difference widened markedly this year. Russian authorities disclosed that 23 servicemen were killed in Syria over 15 months in 2015-2016, whereas Reuters calculated the death toll at 36, a figure that included private contractors. IN IT FOR THE MONEY? One private contractor whose death in Syria was not officially acknowledged was 40-year-old Alexander Promogaibo, from the southern Russian town of Belorechensk. He died in Syria on April 25, his childhood friend Artur Marobyan told Reuters. Promogaibo had earlier fought in the Chechen war with an elite Russian paratroops unit, according to Marobyan, who was his classmate at school. He said his dead friend had struggled to get by while working as a guard in his hometown and needed money to build a house to live with his wife and small daughter. Last year he decided to join private military contractors working closely with the Russian Defence Ministry in Syria and was promised a monthly wage of 360,000 roubles ($6,000), about nine times higher than the average Russian salary. Slideshow ( 5 images ) According to multiple sources, Russian private military contractors are secretly deployed in Syria under command of a man nicknamed Wagner. Private military companies officially don’t exist in Russia. Reuters was unable to get in touch with commanders of Russian private contractors in Syria through people who know them. “I told him it was dangerous and he wouldn’t be paid the money for doing nothing, but couldn’t convince him,” Marobyan said, recalling one of his last conversations with Promogaibo. According to Marobyan, he got the job offer at a military facility belonging to Russia’s military intelligence agency (GRU) near the village of Molkino. The agency is a part of the Defence Ministry and does not have its own spokesperson. The Kremlin did not reply to requests for comment. Promogaibo went there for physical fitness tests and failed twice. He was accepted only after showing up for the third time having losing 55 kg after seven months of training. “He left (Russia) in February,” said Marobyan, who only learnt that his friend had been killed in Syria when his body was delivered to his hometown in early May. One more person who knew Promogaibo said he died in Syria. Reuters was unable to find out where in Syria Promogaibo was killed. Igor Strelkov, former leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine who stayed in touch with Russian volunteers who switched to battlefields in Syria, said in late May that military contractors from Russia recently fought near the Syrian town of Homs alongside Iranian-backed Hezbollah. GRAVESTONES COVERED UP Fifty-one-year-old Russian Gennady Perfilyev, a lieutenant colonel, was deployed in Syria as a military adviser. He was killed in shelling during a reconnaissance trip on April 8, his former classmates at Chelyabinsk Higher Tank Command School said. “Several grammes of metal hit his heart,” Pavel Bykov, one of his classmates, told Reuters. One more classmate confirmed to Reuters Perfilyev was killed in Syria on a reconnaissance trip. His name has not appeared in the Defence Ministry’s official notices of military deaths in Syria. He was buried at a new heavily guarded military cemetery outside Moscow where visitors have to show their passports and are asked at the entrance whose grave they want to visit. On Perfilyev’s gravestone, his name and the date of his death are covered by his portrait. Several other servicemen killed in Syria and buried nearby also have photos obscuring their names and the dates of their death, which if visible would make it easier to trace how and where they died. Names on other graves, of non-Syrian casualties, were visible. Asked if this was a special secrecy measure, a cemetery official, Andrei Sosnovsky, said the names were covered up temporarily until proper monuments could be built.

69e7cad4,"GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!! When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed. Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States. A Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils. State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving. Spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk. “This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta. Many people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose. Here is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible? Quran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority. Is that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities? Just for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different? There is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe. While Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation. The threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans. This move is about keeping the American people safe. Under President Trump, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the American people safe.

This bill, which is supported and endorsed by FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, would impose a 2% fee on all remittances headed south of the US border. Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the US to their home countries. In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the US, while other South and Central American countries received over 15% of their GDPs in the form of remittances. “President Trump has made it very clear that he intends to complete a wall along our Southern border. As a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, I have long supported the border wall, which will protect Americans.” Rogers said. “In order to jumpstart the funding of the wall, I have introduced a bill to impose a 2% fee on remittances sent south of the border. This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall. This bill keeps money in the American economy, and most importantly, it creates a funding stream to build the wall,” Rogers said. - ### -",Noa Pothoven: 'no question of euthanasia' says health minister after teen dies at home CORRECTED,partially false
9babcf02,"In most discussions of suicide and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — including the online buzz that followed publication of a Times analysis on how young California veterans die — one statistic gets repeated most: 22 veterans kill themselves each day. That number comes from a study published in early 2013 by researchers at the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. But the recent wars were not the study’s primary focus. In fact, they play a minor role in veteran suicides overall. Advertisement The VA researchers used death records from 21 states to come up with a 2010 national estimate for veterans of all ages. As a group, veterans are old. Military service being far rarer than it was in the days of the draft, more than 91% of the nation’s 22 million veterans are at least 35 years old, and the overwhelming majority did not serve in the post-9/11 era. About 72% of veterans are at least 50. It is not surprising, then, that the VA found that people in this age group account for 69% of veteran suicides — or more than 15 of the 22 per day. Many experts believe that the farther a veteran is from military service, the less likely it is that his or her suicide has anything to do with his or her time in uniform. In other words, many older veterans are killing themselves for the same reasons that other civilians in the same age group kill themselves: depression and other mental health problems coupled with difficult life circumstances. The VA analysis does not attempt to determine rates of veteran suicide or how they compare with rates for people who never served. Those are surprisingly difficult questions to answer, mainly because the government does not systematically track service members after they leave the military. Advertisement The Times tackled the problem using data on California deaths from 2006 to 2011, the most recent six years available. Rather than focus exclusively on suicide, the analysis considered all 42,734 deaths of adults under 35, a group that includes those veterans most likely to have served in the recent wars. In addition to the cause of death and a variety of other information, each record includes a box indicating veteran status. In the course of reporting, it became clear that the local coroners and funeral home directors who fill out the forms also use that box for active-duty deaths. The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System provided data on active-duty deaths in California by age, gender and cause, allowing The Times to subtract those figures and arrive at the veteran totals. Advertisement The VA provided the California veteran population estimates that The Times used to calculate overall death rates and break them down by cause. The death rates for other civilians were determined using population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. One more step was required to make the comparisons relevant. California veterans under 35 are about 80% male, and nearly half are over 29. A straight comparison to the general population in that age group would be less than ideal, since suicide and accident rates vary significantly by gender and age. Advertisement The Times adjusted the non-veteran death rates so they reflected the age and gender mix of the veteran population. As the story explained, suicide and accident rates were substantially higher for veterans. Over the six years examined by The Times, 329 California veterans under 35 took their own lives. That amounts to an average annual rate of 27 suicides per 100,000 veterans. Advertisement If that rate were to hold true across the country, about 530 young veterans are committing suicide each year — roughly 1.5 each day. That’s probably an underestimate, because there are regional variations in suicide and California tends to fall on the low side. But in talking about the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it’s far closer to reality than 22 each day.

4a3f23ea,"On the 23 June the people of Britain will be faced with the greatest political decision they have had to make in a generation – whether Britain should remain in Europe or leave altogether. I believe that Britain is better off, stronger and safer in Europe than we would be out on our own, and I will be making a proud, positive, and patriotic case for Britain to remain in Europe. Almost half of everything we sell as a nation we sell to Europe, from cars and chemicals to food and financial services. According to studies by the independent Centre for Economics and Business Research, among others, up to four million British jobs are linked to our exports to Europe. And it isn’t just exports. Britain has received £26.5bn a year in investment from EU countries over the last few years. BMW, which employs 7,000 people at plants in Oxford, Birmingham, and Swindon, has said it wanted the UK to remain in and would ‘regret’ exit from Europe. Big companies are far from the only ones who benefit, with 88 per cent of small businesses that export doing so to the EU. As the governor of the Bank of England has said, being in Europe makes us more “dynamic” and “open” as a country. It is not just on jobs and business that Europe makes us better off. Being in means cheaper prices in our supermarkets, cheaper flights to Europe and lower phone roaming charges when travelling. And programmes like Erasmus allow students from all regions and all backgrounds in Britain to study across Europe as part of a year abroad. Indeed, Britain’s universities have prospered from our place in Europe. They win more EU research funding than their French and German competitors combined, and 10 per cent of our public funding for science comes from Europe. We live in an uncertain and fast-changing world, where crime, terrorism, and environmental problems do not respect national borders. Given this, it is vital that we work together with our friends and allies in Europe. One of the terrorists who placed a bomb in a London train station in 2007 and then fled to Italy was brought to face justice in Britain thanks to the European Arrest Warrant, an EU measure. And over 5,000 criminals from the EU have been deported since 2010 under European warrants. Britain is also a leader in the world, partly thanks to our leading role in organisations like the EU, the United Nations and Nato. By playing an active role in all of these, we can work with our allies to shape the world in our interests. The EU has agreed sanctions against Russia to punish it for the invasion of Ukraine. It defeated piracy off the Horn of Africa through a joint naval mission commanded by a British admiral. And it spent well over £1bn dealing with the tragic Ebola epidemic in West Africa. I have some sympathy with arguments made by those who want to quit Europe. I would be the first to say that the EU is far from perfect, and needs to change. But if we leave, we cannot simply ignore our closest neighbour and largest trading partner. So what would our relationship with Europe be if we left? Would we be like Norway, and still have to pay but get no say? Would we have to still accept free movement of people, like Switzerland? Or would we quit Europe’s single market entirely and face taxes on all our exports, like Russia? And what would happen to all those who benefit particularly from being in Europe? Farms, universities and poorer regions which benefit most from EU funding could be left short of vital cash. Workers who benefit from EU legislation would fear its repeal. And anyone with a job at the thousands of firms which trade with Europe would have cause to worry about any loosening of our relationship with the rest of Europe. The people of Britain will not accept vague visions of what a British exit would mean – they need straight talking from the Outers. And that straight talking has been comprehensively lacking so far. I believe that being in Europe is the key to a prosperous and secure future for our country. A new report has found that the actions the EU is now taking – creating a single market in digital services, negotiating trade deals, cutting red tape – will create 790,000 new jobs in the UK by 2030, thanks to a £58bn boost in our national wealth. I am confident that the Government will get a better deal for Britain in Europe, and they have my full support in that endeavour. But we should recognise that Europe is already doing the right things, in becoming less bureaucratic and more focused on creating jobs and helping consumers. Being in Europe is best for Britain, now and into the future. Our place in Europe creates jobs, lowers prices, and widens opportunities. It keeps us stronger and safer in an uncertain world. Most importantly, Europe is reforming, and a British exit would constitute a risky leap into an uncertain future. For these reasons and more, I know that we are better off in.

906d567e,"Addressing a meeting of the committee on Monday, Mohammad Zareian added that the report has been drafted solely based upon unverified, biased and tendentious sources and is merely politically- motivated. Full text of his remarks is as follows: In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful Madam. Chair, The report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran A/75/213 has been drafted solely based upon unverified, biased and tendentious sources and is nothing short of politically motivated. It has not been prepared out of the genuine concern of its orchestrators, but rather with the interest of justifying their policy of aggression and hostility while contributing to their declared objective of subverting the constitutional order legitimately established by the Iranian people. This, in turn, constitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the International Law and International Human Rights Law. Those behind the preparation of the report have manipulated the issues of human rights against my Government in order to distort our realities with false information. It is no secret that provoking the so-called human rights issues are part of the US “maximum pressure strategy” against Iranians. Terrorists, including those who used to be on the terror list of Western countries until recently, have become sweetheart allies in this evil campaign against Iranians. The tragedy, however, lies in the complacency of the UN mechanisms which have become part of such scheming. Glorification of criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of civilians and law enforcement officers, as victims of ethnic or religious discrimination, is abhorrent. Although the specific cases have been raised in the report, were responded to separately in detail by the authorities, the author’s prejudices have marred the report in its entirety, as different parts of the report have been imbued with personal biases. Propagation of fake news and repeated opinionated interpretations, are among several fundamental flaws in the report. Madam Chair, One may wonder if those who are behind the report were racing against time to line up a number of unsubstantiated allegations against my Government. Had they been sincerely concerned about the human rights of Iranians, they would have immediately prepared a mandate to hold the Government of the United States accountable for its inhumane and illegal unilateral coercive measures, which have systematically been intensified in recent months, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The unilateral and illegal sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran constitute the crime against humanity, violating the human rights of an entire nation. The US sanctions have not only had a destructive impact on the well-being of my people, but also continue to prevent them from fully enjoying their human rights. The US sanction policy has always been an inhumane punishment policy targeting and affecting an entire population particularly children and adults with cancer and rare diseases, however, the novel coronavirus has highlighted the cruelty and malice of this crime. The broad limitations imposed on Iran as a result of cruel and illegal US sanctions, prevent my country from purchasing medicines, medical equipment and other necessary supplies to face the pandemic. Madam Chair, Regretfully, the human rights mechanisms have been unable or unwilling to hold Washington accountable for its cowardly and vicious assassination of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, who was the all-conquering hero for bringing Takfiri terrorism to its knees in Iraq and Syria in order to restore peace and security to the region and defend human rights. The silence of the so-called flag-bearers of human rights advocates, with regards to this barbaric crime committed by the U.S. with the cooperation and collaboration of certain countries, including Germany, is deafening now more than ever. Madam. Chair, The UN Human Rights Bodies and officials, on multiple occasions, have complained that they are facing a funding crisis. One may wonder how it is possible then to have released four reports annually on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. I would like to assure you that such reports have not only been drawn up based on a selective approach, but are also almost identical and in violation of the principles of universality, impartiality and objectivity. My delegation rejects, in the strongest terms, the allegations contained in the report; the ill-wisher’s prejudices and hasty judgments have rendered it unfounded and far from reality.

b3c66bb6,"Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, will today pledge to introduce an additional mandated health visit at 3-4 months, as part of Labour’s commitment to making Britain’s children the healthiest in the world. Experts say that 3-4 months is when mothers are at substantial risk of perinatal mental health problems, and is a critical time in supporting continued breastfeeding. Labour will commit an additional £25 million for health visiting to fund the pledge, paid for from Labour’s costed National Child Health Fund, announced in the General election. Child health outcomes in Britain are lagging behind most other high-income countries on obesity rates, tooth decay and mortality. Today’s pledge forms part of Labour’s all-out effort to tackle health inequalities and improve early intervention services. Jonathan Ashworth will also unveil new analysis showing that since the end of the national Health Visitor Programme in 2015, staffing numbers and funding have tailed off: Between 2016/17 and 2017/18, local authorities will have £55.2 million in real terms cut from their public health 0-5 children’s services, which primarily cover universal health visitor reviews, because of public health cuts imposed by this Tory Government. There were 8,244 full time equivalent health visitors working in the NHS as of December 2017, which is the lowest number since August 2013. Numbers peaked at 10,309 in October 2015, meaning there has been a fall of more than 2,065 health visitors or 20% in just over two years The impact of cuts to health visitor numbers is now leading to huge variations in outcomes for children across the country: Nationally, 12% of babies missed out on a New Birth Visit in the most recent period, but performance was mixed- rising to 17% in the South West of England. Nationally, 17% of babies missed out on their 6-8 week review- although in London this was a 1/3 rd of babies. of babies. Nationally, over 25% of children did not receive their mandated one year review by 12 months- in London this was a staggering 44% of children. 90% of North East babies received a two and a half year check, compared to just 64% in London and 73% in the East of England. Additionally, Jonathan Ashworth will today: Pledge to reinstate the Infant Feeding Survey- first established by a Labour Government and then abandoned by the Coalition Government. Pledge to work towards ensuring all maternity services achieve and maintain UNICEF’s UK Baby Friendly Initiative accreditation- as already occurs in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is recommended by NICE as a minimum standard. Pledge support for the ‘70/30 campaign’, which aims to bring about a 70% reduction in child maltreatment by the year 2030. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, speaking to the national ‘Breastfeeding: a public health priority’ conference in London, will say: “Sir Michael Marmot taught us: “The foundations for virtually every aspect of human development – physical, intellectual and emotional – are laid in early childhood.” “Yet after many years of progress, health outcomes for babies and young children in the UK are stalling. We are lagging behind most other high-income countries on mortality, breastfeeding and obesity rates. “So I want to use the opportunity of its 70th anniversary to reflect on the next stage of the NHS’s development. And I strongly believe a laser like focus on improving the health and wellbeing of every child must be an absolute priority. “The future of health visiting services is at a critical juncture. David Cameron and Theresa May used to boast of their commitment to increase the number of health visitors. Yet we have actually seen health visitors cut by more than 20 percent in just over two years. “We must do better in England where families generally receive the lowest level of universal health visiting support when compared to the other UK nations, both in numbers and quality of universal contacts received. “As Health Secretary it will be my commitment to work with Health Visitors to implement an additional mandated health visit at 3-4 months backed up by an extra £25 million of investment from our National Child Health Fund. “Children are 20 per cent of our population but 100 per cent of our future. So our ambition is to create the conditions for the healthiest children in the world.”",Sen. Rick Scott: Democrats Want to Use COVID-19 Spending Package as Payback to Liberal States,TRUE

fdddd52c,"Authorities in Australia have confirmed the bushfires were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not “climate change” as many activists have claimed. Since November, the fires have devastated various regions in New South Wales, destroying thousands of buildings and killing at least 22 people. Summit.news reports: Despite the fact that bushfires are not uncommon in Australia, the severity of the damage led numerous climate change alarmists to blame the disaster on man-made global warming.
Earlier this week, Bernie Sanders blamed those who were “delaying action on climate change” for “the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.” However, according to those tasked with investigating the fires, climate change has nothing to do with it. @7NewsSydney Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season. A strike force will investigate whether blazes were deliberately lit, and bring those responsible to justice. http://7NEWS.com.au @ebatten7 #NSWFires #7NEWS Embedded video “Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season,” reports 7 News Sydney. Authorities in the country have formed Strike Force Indarra, comprising of detectives from homicide and arson units in an attempt to find the culprits. Other causes for the fires include lightning strikes and a natural weather phenomenon called Dipole, again neither of which have anything to do with man-made climate change. Many bushfires are also actually caused by environmentalist ‘green’ policies which prevent land owners from clearing their own vegetation to protect themselves. “Governments appeasing the green beast have ignored numerous state and federal bushfire inquiries over the past decade, almost all of which have recommended increasing the practice of “prescribed burning,” writes Miranda Devine. “Also known as “hazard reduction”, it is a methodical regime of burning off flammable ground cover in cooler months, in a controlled fashion, so it does not fuel the inevitable summer bushfires.” As ever with climate change alarmists, they don’t let the facts get in the way of a good power grab.","Briefing by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, Moscow, April 4, 2019",partially false
10cfd37c,"HON. STEFAN I. MYCHAJLIW ERIE COUNTY COMPTROLLER’S OFFICE DIVISION OF AUDIT & CONTROL 95 FRANKLIN STREET BUFFALO, NEW YORK 14202 January 29, 2021 Erie County Legislature 92 Franklin Street 4th Floor Buffalo, New York 14202 Dear Honorable Members: The Erie County Comptroller’s Office has completed a report on certain personnel and food expenses charged to fund 252, commonly known as CARES Act relief for municipalities. Our objectives were to: Update the amount of expenses for overtime attributed to fund 252. List Managerial Confidential recipients of overtime payments. Update the amount expended for food from fund 252. To accomplish these objectives, we reviewed expenses attributed to fund 252. This report serves as both an update to previous reports regarding overtime expensed to fund 252, as well as food expenses. A meeting scheduled prior to the August break to discuss overtime was postponed, with the intent to meet soon for the discussion. To date, this meeting has not yet been rescheduled. This updated information may be useful at such a discussion when it occurs. Further, the updated information will be useful in any discussions concerning food purchased using fund 252, especially food for employees. Background On March 25, 2020, the United States Senate passed the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act” (CARES) as amended. The United States House of Representatives approved the measure on the following day, and the bill was signed into law on March 27, 2020.
The CARES Act provided significant aid to local governments to combat COVID-19. Erie County received $160 million in federal funding. Erie County created a special fund to account for expenses permissibly reimbursed by CARES Act governmental funding. The fund is identified as fund 252. The money in fund 252 can be used for various purposes related to combatting COVID 19. These purposes include wages to individuals who tasks are to substantially address COVID 19, outfitting offices and other areas to reduce potential exposure to COVID-19, fortifying capacity to work remotely to avoid exposure to COVID-19, and supplies and protective gear to guard against COVID-19, to name just a few permissible uses. As stated, a permissible use of CARES Act funding is to pay employees whose efforts are substantially devoted to addressing COVID-19. As a result, some employees have been hired specifically for such tasks, while others have been authorized overtime for such tasks. The tasks needed to address COVID-19 are varied, and may be different from tasks typically undertaken by employees in their daily activities. At the time of passage, municipalities were required to spend the funds by December 31, 2020. In December, 2020, the deadline was extended so that funds that were determined to not be needed in 2020 must now be expended by December 31, 2021. At the prompting of legislature questions and commentary, our office has previously submitted reports quantifying overtime and holiday worked pay expended to MC employees, overtime and holiday worked pay expended to employees represented by bargaining units, pay for employees who did not report to work and were unable to perform work remotely, the utilization of the imprest fund for expenditures charged to fund 252, and the use of fund 252 for food purchases for individuals quarantining due to COVID-19, as well as employees who report to work. This report focuses serves as an update on overtime, including holiday worked overtime, associated with fund 252, as well as expenditures for food charged to fund 252. It synthesizes, as well as updates, information previously provided. CARES Act Guidance Regarding Expenditures Guidance provided by the United States Treasury Department regarding the CARES Act (updated January 15, 2021) in its Coronavirus Relief Fund Guidance for State, Territorial, Local, and Tribal Governments states that: The CARES Act provides that payments from the Fund may only be used to cover costs that – 1. are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19); 2. were not accounted for in the budget most recently approved as of March 27, 2020 (the date of enactment of the CARES Act) for the State or government; and 3. were incurred during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 2021. The previous deadline for expending CARES Act funds was December 31, 2020; however, the deadline was extended by a year pursuant to section 1001 of Division N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Further, “[t]he statute also specifies that expenditures using Fund payments must be ‘necessary.’ The Department of the Treasury understands this term broadly to mean that the expenditure is reasonably necessary for its intended use in the reasonable judgment of the government officials responsible for spending Fund payments.” Overtime For the purposes of this report, overtime will refer to both overtime and holiday worked overtime charged to fund 252. As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. This amounts to 23.1% of overtime payments to employees. MC employees comprise 6.5% of the county workforce. While the process for allocating overtime to union represented employees is outlined in labor contracts, MC employees are not bound to the terms of those contracts for overtime assignment purposes. The following are overtime payments in excess of $10,000 made to MC employees from fund 252: Office Title Hours Amount Health Commissioner of Health 1266 $183,414

Of the MC employees receiving more than $10,000 in overtime payments, 14 ultimately report to the County Executive and 13 ultimately report to the Sheriff. Although paid overtime for most MC employees was unusual prior to March, 2020, a recently implemented policy has increased the amount of compensatory time that MC employees may accumulate to 200 hours.
CARES Act Guidance Regarding Meals
In the only reference to food in the previously mentioned guidance, it states “Expenses of actions to facilitate compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures, such as: Expenses for food delivery to residents, including, for example, senior citizens and other vulnerable populations, to enable compliance with COVID-19 public health precautions.” It does not mention food expenses for employees. This guidance clearly permits food expenses for individuals housed in the hotel rented by the County for individuals with no other safe housing options and who are battling COVID-19. This qualification as a permissible expense is bolstered by the guidance listing among permissible expenses “expenses for quarantining individuals.”
However, it does not provide entire clarity as to the permissibility of paying for food for employees out of fund 252. Certainly, such expenditures qualify in that they were not otherwise budgeted to occur. Erie County does not typically provide food for employees who arrive for work and are present during a typical meal time. However, given legal and contractual requirements regarding break time for meals, questions may arise as to whether such expenditures are “necessary.” Further, listed examples of ineligible expenditures include “[w]orkforce bonuses other than hazard pay or overtime.” Although bonuses are typically thought of as extraordinary cash payments above and beyond salary, the definition of bonus may also include the provision of food not typically provided to employees in their compensation package. As such, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought from the federal government as to whether the CARES Act permits reimbursement for food expenses for employees while at work. Particular guidance should be requested regarding employees who are working their normal shift, which ordinarily includes a meal period.
New York State Guidance Regarding Meals
In order to properly reimburse for meals, proper documentation is necessary. These documents typically include an invoice, receipt or some other document which evidences what food was delivered and paid for, a statement of the purpose of the meeting, and a description (list) of the individuals in attendance.
The New York State Office of the Comptroller has opined that meal expenses are a proper charge to local governments if the local official is traveling outside of his or her regular work area on official business for an extended period of time or is prevented from taking time off for meals due to a pressing need to complete the business at hand. Clarifying this, the Comptroller opined that when the local government is faced with business of an immediate nature and meetings are essential at mealtime, meals would be a proper local government charge. However, the cost of meals while performing the usual duties of the position within the local government is generally a personal expense. Further, the Office of the New York State Comptroller has ruled that a municipality may make reasonable expenditures for refreshments which are incidental to a lawful municipal purpose. Examples of such expenditures include refreshments for senior citizens incidental to a recreation program; refreshments for the general public attending an official town function, and refreshments for volunteer firefighters at the scene of a serious fire.
Information available in the County’s SAP system, which is our data processing system, does not provide sufficient information to determine if the expenditures were appropriate charges to local government. Departments submitting invoices for payment are responsible for attaching documentation which supports the expenditure to be paid. The supporting documentation should be attached electronically in SAP, along with the corresponding invoice. For example, for many of the expenditures, there was not sufficient information to determine what was actually purchased, which individuals received the meals and why the food purchase was necessary. Further, the descriptions include entries such as “lunch for fire academy,” “dinner for 9th floor phone bank,” “food for Rath EOC – various days,” “groceries for OPS room,” and “supplies for warehouse.” These vague descriptions do not provide enough information to evaluate if there was participation in meetings that were essential at meal time or if there was a concern of an immediate nature.
Because COVID-19 has been present in the community since March, it may be difficult to determine that the reason for the meal was of an immediate nature. Further, there may not be support for the necessity of scheduling meetings during mealtimes. In fact, there are very few mentions of food being for meetings, regardless of whether they were required to occur during mealtimes. Also, it appears from the vague descriptions that many times meals could be provided for employees for performing the work that they are there to perform, i.e. – the usual duties of the position.
Further, given contractual and legal requirements, employees must be given breaks for meals. Failure to offer such breaks, especially on a continued basis, may subject the County to liability for violations of labor law or grievances. If the employees are being given their required meal breaks, they have time to consume meals brought from home, delivered to their work site or picked-up from a nearby restaurant. The fact that food is being delivered to the worksites is an indication that employees have the capability to secure food from a restaurant, if they so choose.
Given New York State guidance, as well as contractual and legal obligations, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought as to whether it is permissible for employees to be provided with meals at government expense.
Summary of Expenditures
A representative list of food expenditures is attached as Appendix A. The list is a compilation of food expenditures actually paid through December 31, 2020. It does not include items for which invoices were received, but not yet paid. The total amount of food expenditures using the fund 252 is $239,689. Prior reports on food listed several observations. These observations included:
Sales Tax Paid: Erie County is a sales tax exempt entity. Sales tax paid was noted on several receipts. It is understood that some restaurants do not accept tax exempt certificates. However, retailers such as BJs Wholesale do accept such certificates. Efforts should be considered to minimize sales tax paid using taxpayer dollars.
Purchases of Non-Food Items: Among the purchases reimbursed were cooking implements, including burners, pots, pans, spatulas, and cutlery. These purchases, made by the warehouse, were then followed by the purchase of food, including uncooked meat. It may be surmised that the raw meat was then cooked using the kitchen equipment. If true, this may be not be appropriate for reimbursement from CARES Act funding, and may also be in violation of New York State Comptroller guidance. If an employee has time to prepare a meal from scratch, it is hard to argue that meals were necessary due to an immediate need of the job. It is advisable to determine whether these expenditures were necessary and appropriate.
Purchases Prior to CARES Act: As stated above, CARES Act funding for municipalities can be used for eligible expenditures between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. A receipt reimbursed to Health Department – Bioterrorism was dated February 18, 2020, and another on February 22, 2020. These would seem to be outside of the parameters for CARES Act spending.
Communal Food: Many of the food items purchased for consumption were communal in nature, meaning that the food was meant to be shared by multiple people. An example of shared communal food would be a sheet pizza or sandwich platter. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), in documenting recommendations for returning to work during the COVID-19 emergency, states that “[e]mployers and employees should not provide communal meals to employees, and should not make food available in common areas where employees may congregate.” As such, communal food should be discouraged. Notably, a large amount of food purchased does appear to be individually packaged meals.
Possible Duplicate Payment – Wellington Pub: On the entire list of entries, there were entries recorded depicting credits or refunds for overpayments made in error. This is not an uncommon practice during a reconciliation process. It was observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 05032020-0001). It was also observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 2020VF-119). A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Duplicate Payment - ECC: It was observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-4847). It was also observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-7847). The two pick-ups would represent roughly double the amount of dinners picked-up from ECC Food Service on days around that time. Further, typically only one pick-up occurred daily from ECC Food Service. A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Delivery expenses: The majority of food purchased was delivered, with delivery included in the final cost. Some food was picked-up. The cost of the food picked-up does not include the cost of labor or other resources used to retrieve the food. Although not known, it is possible that some individuals received overtime for the time spent picking-up food. As such, any analysis of food costs should consider the unreported costs.
Supporting Information Not Available on SAP: As stated above, there is a lack of documentation available on SAP. Some items do not have receipts attached to SAP to determine what was actually purchased. Other items provide important information, such as items purchased, cost per unit, date, location, etc., however there is no information as to the number of individuals consuming the purchased food. The lack of such readily available information could prove problematic in a future audit.
The above concerns have not yet been addressed to the Comptroller’s Office. In fact, certain concerns continue, such as the purchase of raw food products for the warehouse, most recently in November.
Conclusions
The CARES Act provides Erie County with $160 million to combat COVID-19. The funds are to be used for COVID-19 related expenses that were not otherwise anticipated in the budget. The Comptroller’s Office has previously provided updates to the Legislature concerning certain aspects of CARES Act spending, at the request of the Legislature. This report serves as an update to those previous reports.
As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. The highest recipient of overtime received $183,414. This amount, compared to base the pay of all Erie County employees, would put that employee in the top five of over 4,700 employees. That top five list would also include that employee’s base salary of $202,312. A previous report to the legislature noted the comparatively low use of overtime for MC employees across New York State, when compared to Erie County. Most counties, including Erie County’s typical comparator counties, did not pay overtime to MC employees at all.
As of December 31, 2020, fund 252 expenditures for food total $239,689. This amount includes a high percentage spent on food for employees. Further, observations were made questioning the propriety of the spending.
As such, WE RECOMMEND that the propriety of using CARES Act funds to supply employee meals be examined, with particular attention given to the CARES Act, New York State Comptroller guidance, labor law and contractual obligations. Further, WE RECOMMEND that the observations made in Comm. 16D-1 (2020) be reviewed and any necessary corrections be made. In addition, WE RECOMMEND that steps be taken to reduce the usage of tax dollars for the payment of sales tax. WE RECOMMEND that overtime policies be revisited to make sure that payments were consistent with policies that existed at the time of payment. WE RECOMMEND that policies and safeguards be examined to determine how better to protect taxpayer money.

1a0fed37,"Last week, in the days leading up to Sanders’ withdrawal and after, the two spoke several times — including Wednesday, when the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign. Sanders and Biden’s teams have also been in regular communication, with Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir and senior adviser Jeff Weaver speaking with Biden’s top two advisers, Anita Dunn and Ron Klain. Sanders’ endorsement was no mere formality. Though the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign last week, Sanders did not say he endorsed Biden, nor did he call on his dedicated followers to vote for his former opponent. Sanders also pledged to hang on to his delegates, which caused some Democrats to fear the primary could wind up repeating the mistakes of 2016, when acrimony marked the relationship between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many Democrats believe that bitter divide played a role in her loss to Trump in November. That rancor between Clinton and Sanders surfaced again this year when the former senator and secretary of state made headlines during the primary for saying “nobody” likes Sanders. But Biden did. He always made sure to be friendly and respectful with Sanders, who repaid the favor — sometimes too much, Sanders advisers fretted when he refused to bludgeon Biden on the debate stage. Even in 2016, Sanders aides note, Biden made sure to praise Sanders when he was anathema to the rest of the Democratic establishment. ""Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolutely enormous concentration of wealth in a small group of people with the middle class being left out,” said Biden in January 2016. ""It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that.” Biden repeated those words about Bernie’s credibility as he lavished praise on his former rival Monday. Sanders’ endorsement gave Biden a chance to break into the news cycle with a headline-grabbing announcement, a rarity in recent weeks as he, along with Sanders, remains stuck at home during the pandemic as reports about the contagion and the president’s response to it suck up all the media oxygen.",Bernie makes it official: It’s Biden or bust,other
0c21be0d,"Audit of signed envelopes won’t change outcome of presidential race in state, top official says. Members of the Electoral College met in all 50 states and the District of Columbia on Monday to formally cast the votes that determine the presidential election. California's 55 electoral votes put President-elect Joe Biden over the 270 needed to win. Georgia will audit signatures submitted by absentee voters in one county, after President Trump and his allies called for such a review as they continued to question President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the state. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who announced the review on Monday, has said the audit wouldn’t change the outcome of the presidential race in Georgia. “Now that the signature matching has been attacked again and again with no evidence, I feel we need to take steps to restore confidence in our elections,” Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, said Monday at the state Capitol. The secretary of state’s office will work with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to audit signatures in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County, which is expected to take two weeks, Mr. Raffensperger said.

d7dd763a,"With a smile on her face, City Clerk Susana Mendoza was the first to shake the hand of a beaming Mayor Rahm Emanuel after the City Council unanimously approved his first budget, creating an image of satisfaction shared by Chicago's two newest citywide officials. That impression masked, at least for the moment, an ongoing public disagreement about Emanuel's plan to raise the price of vehicle stickers sold through the clerk's office. Emanuel prevailed, after reworking the increase in response to Mendoza's criticism that the mayor was making life tougher on minivan-driving moms and other law-abiding Chicagoans to balance his budget. But it's the clerk's office that will likely receive the complaints next year when the owners of nearly 1.3 million vehicles have to renew their stickers before the June 30 expiration. ""That's when you hear it from people,"" said Miguel del Valle, Mendoza's predecessor. ""There are people out there who keep track of these things. I'm sure that there will be a lot of grumbling."" The increases are potential campaign fodder if Mendoza seeks re-election in 2015 and has an opponent with enough ad money to make an issue of it, del Valle said. But voters also will be reminded of Mendoza's outspoken opposition and the council's 50-0 vote for the mayor's plan, he and other political observers noted. ""It's a shared responsibility between the mayor and the City Council,"" said longtime Ald. Joe Moore, 49th. ""The clerk is on the record as having opposed it, so she's protected herself there."" In fact, Mendoza led the opposition to Emanuel's initial proposal, which would have added $60 to the cost of a vehicle sticker for 184,000 larger SUVs, minivans and full-size cars. Mendoza learned of Emanuel's first plan to raise sticker fees from a reporter the night before the mayor introduced his budget in mid-October, she said. Right after the mayor made his formal presentation, she said, she approached him in the council chambers and told him: ""I'm sorry that I have to oppose it."" Mendoza then conducted a series of interviews bashing the plan, saying it was the wrong time to ask folks who buy the required stickers to shell out more money. Targeting scofflaws with higher late-purchase fees and fines was a better idea, one that would go a long way toward raising the $14.8 million in new sticker revenue Emanuel said he needed to fill more potholes, she said. Emanuel initially defended his plan, but some of his top aides met with Mendoza to talk about alternatives, and a new proposal took shape. The mayor's revised plan increased the rates on all passenger vehicles by $10 to $15. That wiped out the $60 soccer mom increase, but it spread the pain to the owners of an additional 818,000 vehicles that wouldn't have been subject to an increase at all under his first plan. He also picked up Mendoza's idea to increase the late fee, by $20 to $60, and the fine for not having a vehicle sticker, by $80 to $200. He told Mendoza about the changes before they were announced. ""I felt that was very productive at that point, but not necessarily what I wanted to hear,"" Mendoza said. After the mayor's announcement, she noted that she wanted the higher late fees and fines to replace sticker increases, not augment them. She continued to oppose the increases. But the mayor was not going to alter the plan a second time. He had made other budget adjustments, including saving the jobs of 100 library workers. He was counting on the $14.8 million expected from the sticker fees to fix more potholes, and the $9.3 million from the higher late fees and fines to help balance the budget. Mendoza said she believes her budget differences with the mayor won't harm their relationship. ""I told the mayor that we can agree to disagree with that, it's not personal,"" Mendoza said. Emanuel spokeswoman Chris Mather said: ""The mayor has a great relationship with clerk Mendoza."" For now, Mendoza is left with the task of putting in place the new sticker fees. Owners of 1 million passenger vehicles will pay $85, or an extra $10, to buy a sticker next year. It's the first price increase on those stickers since 2000. Owners of about 90,000 larger SUVs and other bigger passenger vehicles, who previously experienced an increase in 2008, will pay $135, or $15 more. About 114,000 pickup truck owners will pay $200, or $20 more, and owners of nearly 60,000 commercial trucks will pay $450, or $30 more. After those increases are in place, sticker fees will automatically rise every two years by the rate of inflation, capped at 5 percent. The first inflation increase will be in mid-2014, months before the next round of city elections. hdardick@tribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal",Trump administration asks Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare,TRUE

After a controversial 85th Session, today's announcement of was highly anticipated and watched. In a bipartisan effort, Representative Thierry submitted a poignant letter with Senator Kolkhorst, to Governor Abbott identifying the urgency of the maternal mortality epidemic in Texas. The letter requested that the issue be added to any Special Session called. Rep. Thierry stated, ""It was clear that a special session was going to happen and we now know that our Texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation. This time around, we cannot afford for party politics to stand in the way of resolving this crisis."" Since the beginning of the 85th session, Representative Thierry, made it a legislative priority to reduce the pregnancy-related deaths in Texas. She authored House Bill 2403, which directed the Maternal Mortality Task Force to study the health conditions and factors that disproportionately affect the most at risk population of women in Texas. Although the bill passed unanimously out of the Public Health Committee, it did not make it to the finish line of the House Chamber. In an unyielding commitment, Thierry worked across the aisle with Senator Lois Kolkhorst, who filed Senate Bill 1929, which would have extended the statutory authority of the Task Force and examined the causes of maternal mortality. Unfortunately, lightning struck twice, as SB 1929 also died in the conference committee process between the Senate and the House.

At the last England international to fall close to Remembrance Sunday, a friendly against Spain in 2011, the poppy was ­relegated off players’ shirts and worn on black armbands instead. Even that was a compromise after Fifa attempted a total ban. The scandal-hit organisation, who climbed down only after an approach by Prince William, have let it be known that their position remains unchanged — but have not released an official statement.

f454e71d,"Today the Education Policy Institute's Independent Mental Health Commission publishes its final report. This is the culmination of a year's research to understand and explore progress and challenges in the transformation of children and young people's mental health care. One in 10 children aged between five and 16 have a mental health problem. That's the equivalent of three in every classroom. Yet children's mental health has always been known as the 'Cinderella of the Cinderella of the NHS', receiving just 0.7% of the total NHS budget, or about 6% of overall spending on mental health. The Mental Health Commission found that services are, on average, turning away 23%, or nearly one in four, of the children and young people referred to them for treatment by their GPs or teachers. It also identified a postcode lottery of waiting times, with wide variation in average waiting times for different providers, from two weeks in Cheshire to 19 weeks in North Staffordshire. The average wait was two months to treatment, but that conceals hidden waits of ten months or more. In March 2015, the government published a strategy, Future in Mind, which aimed to transform children's mental health services, alongside announced investment of £1.25billion over the next five years. The Education Policy Institute has analysed progress in delivering this strategy since then. Every area was asked to develop a 'local transformation plan' as a condition of receiving their share of the funding. The EPI analysis of the plans found wide variation in the quality of plans across local areas. Of the 121 published plans, only 18 areas 15% had 'good' plans. 58 plans 48% 'required improvement' and 45 plans 37% 'required substantial improvement'. The Education Policy Institute also identified significant barriers to the delivery of the strategy. For example, providers are struggling to recruit staff to fill essential posts. Eight out of 10 trusts, 83%, which responded to an Education Policy Institute Freedom of Information request stated that they had experienced recruitment difficulties. The same proportion had had to advertise posts on multiple occasions to fill roles. Mental health nurses were the most difficult profession to recruit, followed by consultant psychiatrists. These recruitment challenges had led to an 82% increase in expenditure on temporary staffing in the last two years. In 2015-16 nearly £50million was spent on agency staff by 32 trusts, up from £27million in 2013-14. Moreover, not all of the investment reaching frontline services. Only £143million of an expected £250million was released in the first year, and of that only £75million was distributed to clinical commissioning groups local health leaders. It is not yet clear how much of this has been spent on frontline services, but reports from mental health providers indicate that they have not yet seen this increased investment. For 2016-17, £119million has been allocated to clinical commissioning groups, but this has been included in their general budget, so there is a risk that it will be spent on other priorities. It is also important to consider this additional investment in the wider context of funding for the whole system. Cuts to local authority early intervention services will have an impact on child and adolescent mental health because these specialist NHS services are part of a wider system which includes local authority funded early intervention support. When those services are cut, the referrals to specialist services increase. The Care Quality Commission has found that reductions in funding, including to non-NHS services, have contributed to increased waiting times. The Commission is therefore calling for a new Prime Minister's Challenge on children and young people's mental health. Based on David Cameron's Dementia Challenge, this would cover research and prevention, early intervention, and increasing access to high quality services. On research and prevention, the Commission's recommendations include the establishment of a new Research Institute to fund research into understanding mental health. It also calls for a strategy to empower young people to live safe digital lives. On early-intervention, the Commission recommends a national programme on mental health and wellbeing within schools. This would include training for teachers and mental health featuring on the school curriculum as part of updated, statutory PSHE lessons. To increase access to high quality care, the Commission urges the government to withhold funding for those areas who cannot demonstrate that they have robust plans to improve services. They should also have to provide evidence that they are investing all the additional funding in children's mental health and not offsetting cuts elsewhere. The Commission also calls for a new national waiting time standard: that no one should wait more than eight weeks for treatment. Mental health problems can seriously affect young people's life chances, holding them back in their education and increasing their risk of ill health and unemployment in adulthood. The government has rightly prioritised improving access to care. The Commission's recommendations aim to ensure that this issue remains at the top of the policy agenda over the next five years and beyond.

As our national debt rages, it’s important that we do what we can to ensure our tax dollars are being spent in the way they were intended. Guaranteeing the rightful recipient of benefits receives benefits is just one way we can address this problem.” The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform where Congressman Steube is a member. ###","Monday morning’s news that Pfizer has shown a 90 percent effectiveness rate in its soon-to-be-available vaccine should have been a moment of national unity and joy. More than that, it should have been treated as an achievement by the Trump administration and its efforts through Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine. But no sooner had the news broken than outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post sought to make sure Trump got no credit for it. The Times quoted Kathrin Jansen, the head of vaccine development at Pfizer as saying, “We have never taken money from the US government or from anyone,” and then went on to claim Pfizer was never a part of Operation Warp Speed. This is simply not true. As NPR reported in July, the government reached a deal for nearly two billion dollars to help distribute the vaccine. Pfizer’s own press release in July announced that the U.S. government placed an initial order of 100 million doses for $1.95 billion. No money went specifically into the vaccine’s research and development, but Pfizer absolutely did take government money, and was forced to walk back Jansen’s statement. In an update to their story, Newsweek provided this key clarification, “This page has been updated to clarify Jansen’s comments following further details from a Pfizer spokesperson. The spokesperson clarified that its vaccine is linked to Operation Warp Speed, though its research and development has not taken funding from the federal government. The headline was also updated for clarity.” There are a few things here that are absolutely shameful. First is that so many news outlets thought the big news here was not that we were nearing a effective vaccine, but that Donald Trump must get no credit for it. But hey, that’s just par for the course right? What is even worse is that a ten-second Google search would have shown that Pfizer was a part of Operation Warp Speed. Hell, even the Wikipedia page shows that Pfizer was a part of Operation Warp Speed. For all of its thousands of employees and giant building on 42nd street, the New York Times couldn’t find what I found while smoking a cigarette in my backyard by looking at my phone? This is what the corporate news media does now. They lie, or at least fail to do anything resembling due diligence as long as what they are reporting hurts Donald Trump and then they clarify. That is not responsible journalism. There is no doubt that millions of people will continue to believe this lie that was corrected in under in less than two hours. As the old saying goes, lies travel the globe before the truth can get its pants on. Make no mistake this vaccine and others, as well as therapeutics, are deeply tied to the president’s efforts on Operation Warp Speed.

23b3f58d,"The Taliban says the US occupation forces in Afghanistan are engaged in “transporting by their choppers” members of the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the war-torn country’s east. Senior members of a Taliban delegation, who are on an official visit to Iran for talks on the Afghan peace process and relevant topics, made the assertion in a news conference in Tehran on Monday, saying that the US forces in Afghanistan are assisting the Daesh terrorists to escape the areas that are coming under the Taliban control. “Daesh were in Nangarhar and Kunar; they existed in those areas. They were eliminated by the Taliban there but their members were transferred by choppers,” Suhail Shaheen, a negotiating member of the Taliban told reporters, adding, “When the Taliban laid a siege on them, we saw that only American choppers could fly as the Afghan airspace is fully under the control of Americans.” The senior Taliban member also referred to the escalation of violence in Afghanistan after the US-Taliban deal last February and said the US forces were to blame as they defaulted on their obligation to end their occupation and resumed the assault. “After the signing of the agreement, we gave a chance to the Americans to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and we were committed not to launch any attacks, so if they terminated the occupation we were committed to refrain from any assaults or attacks so it would pave the way for intra-Afghan talks but unfortunately new attacks were launched against us and we were forced to defend ourselves and they even tried to capture our region and they conducted nightly attacks,” he said. “We have no access to the media but they have. They attribute violence to us and that is not true. They start the violence. They start the violent action and that’s still continuing.” During the news conference, the Taliban negotiator said the group was after an “inclusive system and establishment” in Afghanistan and not after “monopolizing power,” adding that they would reconsider the agreement with US ‎if foreign forces failed to withdraw from Afghanistan. “We have resisted the occupation of Afghanistan for 20 years and we will continue resistance against occupation if foreign forces remain in the country,” the senior Taliban member said. Last week, the Taliban political delegation arrived in Tehran at the invitation of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the latest of such visits that have been paid several times over the past months. Iran strongly supports the realization of peace and stability in Afghanistan, which has been embroiled in decades of militancy fueled by foreign military intervention. The intra-Afghan talks started after the United States agreed to withdraw 12,000 US troops from Afghanistan in exchange for the Taliban’s halting of their attacks on international forces under a deal between the two sides in February 2020. The deal was intended to result in the reduction of bloodshed, but violence continues to take a heavy toll on the country. In recent months, deadly attacks and high-profile assassinations have seen a rise in Afghanistan. The Taliban have denied responsibility for the killings, but Afghan and US officials have pinned the blame on the group. Despite the ongoing talks between Kabul and the Taliban, the administration of US President Joe Biden has said it would review the peace deal reached last year. The US first invaded Afghanistan in 2001 under the banner of fighting “terrorism.” The invasion toppled the Taliban, but the group has never stopped its attacks, citing the foreign military presence as one of the main reasons behind its continued militancy. Since the US invasion of Afghanistan, Washington has spent more than two trillion dollars for the war on the impoverished country, according to some estimates. Over 2,400 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have been killed.","Putin’s End-of-Year Press Conference, in Quotes",FALSE
34eec9be,"By Rep. Matt Wand Lately, former state Rep. Brent Barton has taken to these pages to call for the elimination of tax ""kicker"" refunds to Oregonians. Eliminate the kicker refund, Barton writes, and the state's finances will stabilize and we'll earn a much-coveted ""AAA"" from bond rating agencies. Repealing the kicker may impress some Wall Street bankers, but it'll do little to stabilize state finances and absolutely nothing to improve our economy and put people back to work. Oregon voters placed the kicker in the Oregon Constitution as a reaction to Salem's spending habits. Their suspicions are well-founded. Every time the Legislature ""suspended"" the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues. We have no reason to believe this time it will be any different. During Barton's single term in the Oregon House, the 2009 Legislature raised taxes by $1.6 billion while increasing overall state spending by 18 percent, all during a historic recession. This kind of spending, with or without the kicker, is not a good recipe for fiscal stability. Rather than eliminating the kicker, a better solution is to require the Legislature to set aside 1 percent of general fund revenue for a rainy day fund every biennium. The plan is simple because it forces state government to save money before it spends it all. Rather than waiting years for the kicker to kick in, this proposal would provide consistent savings to protect vital services during an emergency. To earn an AAA rating, Oregon needs an AAA economy. Rather than extracting more revenue, government should create an environment in which businesses can succeed and hire. We should also provide tax relief to families and low-income Oregonians. Last session, I supported legislation that would have provided a $500 child tax credit and would have adjusted the personal income tax brackets to reduce the burden on those who are suffering during this economic downturn. When Oregonians have more money in their pockets, they will spend it at local businesses, help create jobs and generate more tax revenues for state and local governments. With more money in the economy, nonpartisan analysts in Salem have estimated this legislation would have created over 19,000 jobs. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to pass measures to encourage businesses to hire unemployed workers, to reduce excessive regulations on businesses seeking to locate and expand in Oregon, and to provide tax relief to families and low-income Oregonians. The Legislature should reconsider these solutions when it reconvenes in February. Barton's argument for eliminating the kicker ignores the fact that Oregon is still mired in a deep economic downturn. Raising taxes will not create more jobs, and over the long term will not bring long-term stability that Barton and others are promising. As long as Oregon's economy continues to struggle, an AAA rating alone won't solve our problems. We need an AAA economy, with a consistent savings plan and a healthy business environment to secure Oregon's long-term stability and prosperity. Rep.

This is a virus that, without adequate restrictions in place, spreads with ferocity. Case rates are increasing again, hospital admissions are climbing again. R is edging up again. “Last week the England wide rate was 159 per 100,000. Now its 188 per 100,000. That’s a 20 per cent increase. Across London cases have increased 30 per cent in a week, the East of England 36 per cent. “None of us are surprised at the action he is taking today. Indeed he was warned that Tier 2 wouldn’t be enough to contain the spread of this virus. Now it looks like in some areas, such as Kent, Tier 3 isn’t enough to contain the spread either. “Elsewhere in the country Tier 3 areas appears to be broadly flat lining, with some like North West trending down. But overall the increasing areas are rising faster than the decreasing areas are falling. “As things stand, we are heading into the Christmas easing with diminishing headroom. The buffer zone these tiers were supposed to provide is getting much thinner. “So what is his plan to keep people safe through Christmas and to avoid huge pressures in the NHS in January? What is his plan to support an exhausted, understaffed NHS through January to deliver the care patients will need? And is he confident that our NHS won’t be so overwhelmed in January that it impacts the vaccination programme? “Our response to Covid-19 could have been stronger had Serco’s contact tracing not left a gaping hole in our defences. In boroughs like Islington only 65 per cent of contacts were traced by the national system. In Tower Hamlets only 60 per cent; In Barking 61 per cent. “Test and Trace is costing £22 billion – more than the policing and fire service combined – and yet according to the NAO, up to September only £785 million was allocated to local council public health teams. “Serco have subcontracted to 21 other firms offering little training to staff, with some in call centres alongside others making sales calls for gambling websites. It’s time to scrap Serco, and put all public health teams in the lead doing the retrospective cluster busting contact tracing we need. “He has promised more testing for Tier 3 areas, what about Tier 2 areas? On Lateral Flow Tests some care home providers refused to use them due to concerns about their accuracy, is he satisfied these tests are accurate enough for this purpose and are safe? And if they can’t be used for care homes how quickly can care home residents’ relatives makes use of PCR tests? “He often praises Liverpool. But isn’t the biggest lesson to draw from Liverpool that people still struggle to isolate if they haven’t got the financial means to do so? “The eligibility criteria for the £500 payment is too tightly drawn. People need decent sick pay. People in some circumstances need alternative accommodation. People need help with shopping and medicines. Surely some of the £22 billion spent on Test and Trace could be reallocated to offer people isolation support? “On the mutation in the virus identified, our constituents will be naturally concerned – will he keep the house updated on this? “Finally, today I spoke to Fred Banning.

8.00E+25,"A coalition of civil society groups has described the proposed Control of Infectious Diseases Bill as a threat to human rights. The group, 41 in total, said the House of Representatives must subject the bill to public scrutiny by embarking on stakeholders’ consultations and a public hearing to harness public inputs into the legislation. Many Nigerians had criticised a move by the House of Representatives to repeal the Quarantine Act and replace it with the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill. The bill, which scaled second reading before it was stood down last week, has 82 sections. Sponsored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, the bill seeks to strengthen the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and make it more proactive and “not just reactive and function when there is an outbreak.” The bill seeks to empower the president, the minister of health as well as the director-general of NCDC, and the institutions they head, to make regulations on quarantining, vaccination and prevention of infectious diseases in Nigeria. CSOs position In a statement issued on Tuesday, the groups said the bill empowers NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms of the people. “The Bill empowers the NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms at will, and abuse constitutionally established institutions and processes, without any form of accountability. “For instance, Section 10 (3) gives the Director-General express powers to use force to enter any premises without a warrant,” it said. The group also said the bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. It, therefore, demanded the immediate review of all provisions of the bill. “The Bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. “This leaves room for significant amount of discretion on the part of the implementing authorities and limits the rights of citizens and respective institutions to question decisions taken in the exercise of the powers provided in the Bill. “We demand a review of all provisions of the Bill that foster inter-agency conflicts and abuse of power and undermine constitutionally guaranteed rights and are contrary to the rule of law and Nigeria’s international human rights obligations.” The groups include: Girl Child Africa, Center For Liberty, Centre for Democracy and Development, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Say No Campaign, Amnesty International, YIAGA Africa, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, Global Rights and African Centre for Media and Information Literacy. Others are International Press Centre, Lawyers Alert, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Enough is Enough, Community Life Project, Centre for Information Technology and Development, Centre for Impact Advocacy, Concerned Nigerians, Lex Community NG, Education as a Vaccine, Dinidari Foundation, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Dorothy Njemanze Foundation, Tap Nitiative for citizens development, Raising New Voices Initiative, Haly Hope Foundation, Youths Concerns Development Foundation, Adopt A Goal For Development Initiative, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, PITCH Nigeria, House of Justice, Molluma Medico-Legal Centre, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Alliances for Africa, Youths in Motion, Persons with Disabilities Action Network, Silverchip Fox, Community Action for Popular Participation and Resource Centre for Human Rights & Civic Education. Allegations On Tuesday, Mr Gbajabiamila said the allegation that the bill is a sinister attempt to turn Nigerians into guinea pigs for medical research while taking away their fundamental human rights was far from the truth. He said as representatives of the Nigerian people, members of the House would never contemplate doing anything that would jeopardise the wellbeing of the citizens.

57d407f9,"The majority of Britons say the police have lost control of the streets, a shocking Daily Mail poll reveals today. According to the exclusive survey, 57 per cent of people say officers have surrendered control of our neighbourhoods and criminals have no fear of being caught. Amid skyrocketing levels of crime, the poll also reveals that a quarter of the population don’t feel safe at night in their local area. And it suggests that one of the biggest factors behind the recent surge in lawlessness is a lack of ‘bobbies on the beat’. An incredible 60 per cent of the public say they haven’t seen a police officer in their street in the past year. The poll will increase pressure on ministers to get a grip on the violent crime wave engulfing the UK. Nearly 2,000 British people were surveyed with over half expressing a lack of faith in the police Rates of violence have soared to the worst level since records began, with offences more than doubling in the past four years across the country. The survey of 2,000 adults was conducted for the Mail by ComRes and We The People. Among a series of worrying findings, it revealed: In Half 51 per cent of those surveyed who had been a victim of crime in the past two years said police did not even bother going to their home, and nearly a third of victims 30 per cent were told to gather evidence themselves; In Some 57 per cent of the public feel police no longer treat crimes such as burglary with the seriousness they deserve; In Three in four Britons 76 per cent want more bobbies on the beat; In More than half 54 per cent believe political correctness is partly to blame for the soaring murder rate in cities. David Green, of the think-tank Civitas, said: ‘It is not surprising that 57 per cent of people think the police have lost control of our streets because criminals no longer fear being caught. ‘One of the primary causes has been the reduction in the number of police by about 20,000 officers since 2010. Rates of violent offences have nearly doubled over the last two years to reach an all-time high ‘Criminals are deterred when they see a regular police presence on the streets, but if they never see a uniform they become emboldened.’ The Police Federation of England and Wales’ operational policing lead, Simon Kempton, said the poll mirrored its own research. ‘Neighbourhood policing which was once a key feature of every community has all but vanished,’ he said. ‘Local bobbies who once would have been a familiar sight on the streets of the UK are being redeployed to emergency response teams to meet the increasing demand facing policing. ‘What is already clear is that greater investment – both monetary and in terms of personnel – is needed to put the boots back on the ground.’ Two thirds 67 per cent of Britons said political correctness and the fear of offending minorities was partly to blame for the problems encountered tackling child sex grooming gangs in major cities. It comes after a succession of convictions of Asian grooming gangs operating in towns including Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford, Newcastle and Aylesbury. The Mail poll found more than half 57 per cent of those surveyed thought the police were scared of upsetting some parts of society, resulting in them being less effective at their job. The shocking results of the poll found that bin men were more highly rated than police officers And when asked to compare public services, the poll found bin men were more highly rated than police officers, with approval ratings of 49 per cent compared to 43 per cent. Association of Police and Crime Commissioners chairman David Lloyd said: ‘Police and crime commissioners recognise the challenges that policing is under, driven in part by changes in demand on the service, including increased complexity of crime. ‘We also understand the real concerns that people have and, in consultation with the public, are fully committed to ensuring that the resources we have are directed in the right way.’ National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for neighbourhood policing, Deputy Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, said police chiefs were reviewing neighbourhood policing, adding: ‘The latest inspection of police forces in England and Wales found a good level of service to the public. ‘But they also found forces were under strain as they deal with rising crime and demand that is more complex – and an unprecedented terror threat – with fewer officers. ‘We recognise how important and valuable neighbourhood policing teams are to local communities. With the College of Policing, we are carrying out the most fundamental review of neighbourhood policing in a decade so officers are equipped with tactics that are proven to work.’",MSM link Italy neo-Nazi weapon haul to ‘pro-Russian separatists’ despite police saying the OPPOSITE,TRUE
0c4a9e4b,"Ministers were in full-on retreat over the 'appalling' treatment of Britain's Windrush generation of immigrants today. MPs queued up to voice fury at the plight of long-term residents who have lost their everyday rights as Britons - with the government admitting some might have been deported in error. Home Secretary Amber Rudd apologised for the threat to deport them - and launched a furious attack on her own department for the blunder. And Theresa May U-turned and agreed to meet Jamaican leaders attending a Commonwealth summit in London to discuss the treatment of the post-watr immigrants. The PM's spokesman also said the premier 'regretted' the treatment of the Windrush generation and Home Office guidance was being changed. Ms Rudd launched an outspoken attack on her officials telling the Commons she is concerned Home Office officials 'lose sight of the individual'. The shift came as immigration minister Caroline Nokes admitted some of the cases were 'appalling' and people had been deported in error - although her boss Amber Rudd later cast doubt on the assertion. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has expressed 'deep concern', while International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt admitted the government must do a 'better job' of dealing with issue. Scroll down for video Leaders from Caribbean countries who wanted to discuss with Theresa May the plight of those who have lost their everyday rights as Britons have been told there will be no formal meeting with the Prime Ministers pictured: the SS Empire Windrush which brought the first generation of workers to Britain from the West Indies in 1948 Answering questions from furious MPs in the Commons, Ms Rudd offered an apology for the way cases had been handled Theresa May, pictured with Prince Harry at the Commonwealth summit in London today, has U-turned and will now meet Caribbean leaders to discuss the treatment of Windrush immigrants Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said she had been 'appalled' by the cases - but said she did not know how many had been ejected in error Communities Secretary Sajid Javid took to Twitter to voice 'deep concern' about the situation Ministers are under pressure to end the 'inhumane' betrayal of migrants who came here with their parents after the Second World War and never became naturalised British citizens. Tens of thousands who arrived as children from the Caribbean are said to have been 'treated like criminals'. Jamaicans told to adopt local accent if they are sent back to island An official Home Office document advising Windrush immigrants being sent to Jamaica tells them to adopt the local accent. The Coming Home to Jamaica leaflet warns that Jamaicans can be hostile to those speaking in a foreign accent. And it urges them to pick up a local dialet to blend in. It stats: 'Try to be ‘Jamaican’ – use local accents and dialect overseas accents can attract unwanted attention. Advertisement Answering questions from furious MPs in the Commons, Ms Rudd offered an apology for the way cases had been handled. 'I do not want any of the Commonwealth citizens who are here legally to be impacted in the way they have,' she said. 'Frankly, some of the ways they have been treated has been wrong, has been appalling and I am sorry. 'That's why I am setting up a new area in my department to ensure that we have a completely new approach to how their situation is regularised.' And she laid the blame for the blunder with officials in her department, telling MPs: 'I am concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes lose sight of the individual. 'This is about individuals, and we have seen the individual stories, and they have been, some of them, terrible to hear, and that is why I have acted.' She added: 'I am not aware of any specific cases of a person being removed in these circumstances. 'That is why I have asked the high commissioners if they know of any, that they should bring it to me. Labour MP David Lammy delivered a searing attack on the government's handling of cases Mrs Rudd said she was not certain whether any of the Windrush generation had been deported 'And I would ask anybody here if they know of any such circumstances, they should bring them to the Home Office.' Ms Rudd said she would be meeting high commissioners from Commonwealth countries this week to find out whether any people had been wrongly removed from the UK. She made the remarks after coming in for heavy criticism from MPs in the Commons. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said it was 'inhumane and cruel' for so many in the Windrush generation 'to have suffered so long in this condition'. He added: 'This is a day of national shame and it has come about because of a hostile environment policy that was begun under her Prime Minister. 'Let us call it as it is. If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas, and that is what has happened with this far right rhetoric in this country.' The Commonwealth heads of government meeting is being held in London this week and Guy Hewitt, High Commissioner for Barbados, told the Guardian: 'We did make a request to the summit team for a meeting to be held between the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Caribbean heads of government, and regrettably they have advised us that that is not possible.' Albert Thompson has been denied life- saving treatment on the NHS Albert Thompson, who has been denied life saving treatment on the NHS Albert Thompson, 63, has lived in London for 44 years - but told he must pay £54,000 for life saving treatment on the NHS. For three decades Mr Thompson worked, supported a family, and was a head mechanic for a string of garages, and paid his taxes. His mother arrived in the UK from Jamaica in the Sixties to come and work her as a nurse. He had surgery for prostate cancer in January last year, before NHS eligibility rules were tightened, and was to begin radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, last November. But when he arrived for his first NHS radiotherapy session following the removal of his prostate, he was told he was not entitled to free treatment. It is because the Home Office can find no record of Mr Thompson, who was born in Jamaica, in its files. He lost the Caribbean passport he arrived in the UK with some years ago. And without a British passport - which he's never had and cannot not get because there is no documentary proof of his arrival here as a teenager in 1973, landlords will not house him and the NHS have told his he can't have treatment. He said: 'At present I'm left in limbo. It feels like I've been left to die because the job hasn't been finished. I get depressed, stressed out, anxious. 'I used to have a life, to work, to go out, enjoy myself. I had a nice car, a home. I went to the cinema, dancing. But that's the past. I have to think about the present and it's hard to come to terms with. I've got no money. 'I'm very angry with the Government that I'm in this position. I'm here legally, but they're asking me to prove I'm British.' Mr Thompson worked until 2008 when he was diagnosed with the blood cancer lymphoma and an acute back problem; since then he has been too ill to work. He was evicted from his rented flat because his landlord wanted to sell it. Tenants must now produce a British passport in order to rent accommodation. As Albert — not his real name — does not have a passport, he could not find a home. 'I was on the streets for three weeks. I had to beg for food. I felt ashamed. I just asked people in shops if they had anything spare.' After three weeks, Albert had managed to secure a room through a homeless charity, St Mungo's. He still lives in that accommodation now. Advertisement Elwaldo Romeo has lived in Britain for 60 years - but told he is in UK illegally Elwado Romeo has lived in the UK for nearly 60 years Elwaldo Romeo has lived in Britain for almost 60 years, but has now been told by the Home Office that he is in the UK illegally. He moved from Antigua to the UK when he was four, 59 years ago, and has lived and worked her ever since. But according to the Guardian he received a Home Office letter telling him he was 'liable to be detained' because he was a 'person without leave.' The letter continued: 'You have NOT been given leave to enter the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971.' He has been told to report fortnightly to Home Office premises. The letter also offered advice on 'help and support on returning home voluntarily'. Mr Romeo, 63, said: 'It scares the living daylights out of you – the threatening language on the letters. 'This is the country I've grown up in. I love it and it's been very good to me over the years. But I'm devastated it has come to this. I feel like I'm being thrown aside.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'We have been in touch with Mr Romeo to assure him that we are urgently reviewing his case and to help make sure that he is providing the correct information to demonstrate his status.' Romeo said: 'I'm not impressed with the way they are dealing with me and other people in my situation. People's lives are on hold. They don't take into consideration that I've been here since I was four.' Advertisement New rules require documentary evidence of the right to be here, which many Windrush children do not have as anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1971 was given indefinite leave to remain, meaning many did not apply for a British passport In a growing scandal, children of the Windrush migrants, named after the ship which brought the first generation of workers to Britain from the West Indies in 1948, have fallen victim to an immigration loophole that has left them in a legal limbo. Despite having lived here and paid taxes for decades, some have lost their homes, jobs and benefits, been denied NHS treatment and threatened with deportation. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1971 was given indefinite leave to remain by that year's Immigration Act. But many never applied for a British passport. Michael Braithwaite's employers ruled he was an illegal immigrant Michael Braithwaite lost his teaching assistant job after his employer ruled he was an illegal immigrant Experienced special needs teaching assistant Michael Braithwaite lost his job after his employers ruled that he was an illegal immigrant - despite living here for more than 50 years. He arrived in Britain from Barbados in 1961, and had worked at a north London primary school for over 15 years when a routine check on his immigration status revealed he did not have an up to date identity document. His employer got in touch with him to tell him that without a biometric card he could not continue to be employed. He lost his full time job in 2017, after the local authority ruled he needed to submit proof he had the right to live in the UK. A biometric card is a residence permit issued to non-British residents, with details of their immigration status Mr Braithwaite attended primary school and secondary school in Britain, and worked continuously since leaving school. He married in London and has three British children and five grandchildren. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: 'It made me feel like I was an alien. I almost fell apart with the stress. I never applied for a British passport. We thought we were British.' Enny Choudhury, Braithwaite's lawyer, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: 'For almost one year the Home Office has failed to issue the biometric card, without which he cannot work or move on with his life, causing uncertainty and distress.' Advertisement Tough new rules were introduced four years ago to weed out illegal immigrants and prevent them renting a home, working, opening a bank account and holding a driving licence. The rules require documentary evidence of the right to be here. But many Windrush-era children do not have such proof. Securing a residence permit requires sending the Home Office up to four pieces of documentary evidence for every year spent in the UK – an almost impossible task. Ms Mordaunt told BBC radio 4's Today programme: 'People who are in that situation, there is absolutely no question of their right to remain, and their right to gain access to services such as healthcare. 'What clearly needs to happen is we need to do a better job with the process that these individuals are having to go through. 'People should not be concerned about this - they have the right to stay and we should be reassuring them of that.' The Daily Mail has launched a campaign in support of the Windrush generation. We are calling for a lower burden of proof for those who arrived here before 1971, and more flexibility shown to those who have lived here and paid taxes for several decades but were never naturalised. Grandmother Paulette Wilson threatened with deportation Grandmother Paulette Wilson has finally given leave to remain after a two-and-a-half year struggle Grandmother Paulette Wilson, from Wolverhampton, was threatened with deportation, despite living here for 50 years. This month she finally received leave to remain in Britain after a two-and-a-half-year struggle. The 61-year-old was denied benefits, access to healthcare and refused permission to work. In 2015 she received a letter saying she had 'no right' to be in the country, telling he she had to register each month in Solihull, and she even spent a week in the immigration detention centre in Yarl's Wood in October. Mrs Wilson was taken to London Heathrow Airport and threatened with deportation to Jamaica, where she has not returned since leaving age 10. But now she has received a biometric residency permit, confirming her settled status in the UK and bringing her a step nearer to gaining British citizenship. She said: 'I've never done anything wrong; how could I be an illegal? 'It would be nice to get an apology from the government saying: we are sorry we put you though this.' Paulette will now have to complete a naturalisation process to become a British citizen. Her worried daughter Natalie Barnes says her mum is still traumatised by her experience. She added: 'The experience of being in the detention centre won't ever leave her.'

The former minister, whose Guyanese parents were Windrush migrants, added: 'It is a stain on our nation's conscience and the Home Secretary and Prime Minister must act urgently to right this historic wrong.

353ed1f7,"The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States… THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP: ‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men. He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation. While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’ “He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.” Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours. IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth. Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate. He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous. The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that. Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’ The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated. That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code. ‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project. The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer. For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around. Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes. Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment. ‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’ ‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’ Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’ Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel. He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes. ‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices. ‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’ His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things. Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him. Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’ The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?” ‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’ ‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’ Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw. He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome. He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine. His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare. Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting. His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them. After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can. Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons? He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago. His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it. The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen. He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything. He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.

856b12c1,"Travis Rowley: Race-Baiting Democrats “Democrats have been running our inner-cities for the past 30 to 40 years, and blacks are still complaining about the same problems. More than 7 trillion dollars have been spent on poverty programs since Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty with little, if any, impact on poverty. Diabolically, every election cycle, Democrats blame Republicans for the deplorable conditions in the inner-cities, then incite blacks to cast a protest vote against Republicans.” – Frances Rice, Chairman of the National Black Republican Association Not that liberals ever relent in their shallow quest to widely characterize Republicans as racist, but the Democratic race-baiters seemed to be particularly busy this past week. Here in Rhode Island we saw Rep. Charlene Lima (D - Cranston) join a chorus of Democrats across the country when she likened Rhode Island’s new Voter ID law to “Jim Crow” policies. Last summer Rep. Jon Brien (D – Woonsocket) informed everyone on A Lively Experiment that the National Democratic Congressional Committee had been contacting Rhode Island Democrats, pressuring them to reject the anticipated Voter ID bill. According to Brien, they didn’t want to “pass this legislation because you will mess up [the Democratic] paradigm. The paradigm is…the Republicans, those nasty people, are trying to bring us all the way back to the Jim Crow laws.” I guess Representative Lima got the memo. The Left continued their obsession with race this week when New York Times columnist Lee Siegel wrote that “Mitt Romney is the whitest white man to run for president in recent memory,” and that that is “the one quality that has subtly fueled his candidacy thus far and could well put him over the top in the fall.” Liberals always revert back to their default position: America is racist. In a time when it is arguably a political advantage to be anything but white, and just several years after the election of a black president, Siegel somehow views a black man’s chances in a presidential election equal to that of a Martian. Sure, President Obama defeated a white man in 2008. But John McCain has nothing on Mitt Romney. At least not in terms of his whiteness! This is really how liberals think. South Carolina Also deciding to illustrate that race is never a factor until Democrats decide to inject it into the discussion was chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party Dick Harpootlian, who criticized Republicans for holding their debate in South Carolina on Martin Luther King Day: “The Republicans are scheduling their debate [for] Monday, Martin Luther King Day, without any regard, whatsoever, [for] the civil rights issues that this state has faced…[Romney should say] 'no, I don't want to have a debate on Martin Luther King's birthday, that's a day we need to celebrate a great American leader.'"" When it was revealed that, in 2008, the Congressional Black Caucus also hosted a Democratic presidential debate on MLK Day, Harpootlian shifted his argument to another false proclamation, claiming that Republicans hadn’t bothered to even “recognize” the holiday or “approach” the black community in South Carolina. Harpootlian denied that he ever said hosting a debate on MLK Day was improper, but instead had merely argued that “it is indicative of a process in which [Republicans] have not engaged the African-American community in this state.” Just like that, Harpootlian was right back where he started: Republicans are racist. Blacks made up only two percent of Republican primary voters in South Carolina in 2008. Maybe if Democrats stopped lying to black people by constantly insinuating that Republicans hate them, then perhaps there would be an actual base of black Republicans that Republican candidates could speak to during competitive, small-turnout primary elections. It seems like a fitting moment to remind everyone that Martin Luther King was a Republican and, if alive, would probably have come to his own party’s defense by telling Harpootlian to stop being such a whiny, hyper-sensitive, little weasel. And to stop pandering black people to death. Stopping Republicans From Helping Minorities Ironically, by disingenuously retreating from his race-baiting comments, Harpootlian came across as if he actually wanted Republicans to steal black voters away from the Democratic Party. But the last thing Democrats want is for Republicans to be anywhere near minority neighborhoods, speaking candidly and revealing to minorities the damage that Democratic policies have done to their communities. For Democrats, it’s best to just continue fostering an awkward relationship of mistrust between Republicans and minorities. When Mitt Romney was approached last week by Ruth Williams, an unemployed woman in South Carolina who asked Romney for financial help, Williams reported that “[Romney] got money and he paid for my light bill.” But because Williams is black, a Miami Herald reporter was horrified by the incident: “As an African-American woman it galls me. I don’t even like to watch it. I felt like it plays into every sort of patronizing stereotype of black people.” Have the government give them anything they want. Just don’t show me a black person receiving personal charity. It’s too painful! Republicans can’t help black people. Democrats get too offended. Race-obsessed and on a perpetual mission to smear Republicans as racist, when Newt Gingrich called Barack Obama “the best food-stamp president in American history” liberals were the ones who insisted on conjuring up images of black food-stamp recipients – accusing Gingrich of racial insensitivity despite the fact that most food-stamp recipients are white. Liberal Fox News reporter Juan Williams tried to get Gingrich to acknowledge that his words were “particularly [insulting] to black Americans” during last Monday’s debate. Gingrich’s response: “First of all, Juan, more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in history. I know among the politically correct you're not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.” But Williams went on to argue that, when speaking about black people in particularly, Gingrich did say at one point that “black Americans should demand jobs, not food stamps.” Only Democrats could be insulted by such a message. Poverty is the condition that makes someone eligible for food-stamps. And a job is the way out of poverty. While Republicans explain how Democratic policies destroy economic opportunity, and then point out a pathway to prosperity, all Democrats can do in the face of such criticism is to remind black people to be insulted – which has gotten them absolutely nowhere ever since they migrated under the Democratic banner several decades ago.

d523eee3,"A belief in catastrophic man-made global warming should hinge on a couple of key factors. First, it must be shown that in the recent past the Earth was a cooler place. Second, temperatures in the present and in the future must show a dramatic increase in times of increased carbon dioxide. These facts would supply evidence that scientists could use to show that our planet is getting quickly warmer. Such a graph would look much like a hockey stick. But weather hasn’t always cooperated with the climate-alarmist version of events. And when temperatures don’t cooperate with climate hysteria, too often we find climate alarmists manipulating data. History — even recent history — gets changed to reflect what should be happening according to those “in the know.” Geologist Tony Heller, however, isn’t one to rely on what the mainstream media and climate scientists tell us is happening. Being a scientist, Heller is keen on reporting facts instead of hysteria. And Heller is telling us that global temperature data is being manipulated before our very eyes. According to Heller, NASA has manipulated historical temperature data to show a dramatic increase in temperature, especially since the year 2000. Comparing NASA charts from the years 2000, 2017, and 2019, Heller shows data has been manipulated multiple times since the year 2000. Heller shows, with NASA’s own data, that the space agency has been adjusting temperatures from the past — temperatures from as long ago as the mid-1800s — downward, while adjusting current-day temperatures upward, and those changes are responsible for most of the claimed global warming during that time. In the year 2000, historical data showed a .5 degree Celsius increase from the mid-1800s to the year 2000. In 2017, the same agency’s historical temperature data showed a 1.5C increase and just two years later a 2.0 C increase. In each of those time frames, older temperatures are pushed slightly downward. The 2017 to 2019 rise in temperature is especially confusing when you add the fact that satellite temperature data shows a global decrease in land temperature for the last two years. As well, satellite data adds to the case of fraud in another way: According to satellite data, since the year 2000, land temperatures have increased by .2 degrees Celsius, but NASA’s latest chart says that temperatures increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius since 2000. So more than 80 percent of the change in temperature since the year 2000 is the result of temperature data manipulation. “They’ve quadrupled warming mainly by cooling past temperatures and warming present temperatures,” Heller said in a video released on Monday. Moreover, the entire Medieval Warm Period has disappeared. The Medieval Warm Period, which has lots of scientific and historical evidence to show it happened — and which was prominent in a 1990 IPCC graph — has been adjusted out of existence. Climate alarmists can’t have a Medieval Warm Period, since it casts so much doubt on the current theory that man is causing a current upward temperature swing. The Medieval Warm Period occurred before man could reasonably be blamed for it. That’s why in 1999 when Michael Mann released his infamous “hockey stick graph,” the Medieval Warm Period was suddenly gone. Thus did Mann create a non-existent global-warming “tipping point” based on CO 2, starting in the late 19th century. “If we had high temperatures when CO 2 was low, that would indicate that other factors in the climate are much stronger than carbon dioxide,” Heller pointed out. The CO 2 tipping point farce goes beyond Michael Mann’s skullduggery. A 2006 statement by Dr. David Deming revealed that as early as 1995 scientists were facing pressure to “get rid of” the Medieval Warm Period. “I had another interesting experience around the time my paper in Science was published. I received an astonishing e-mail from a major researcher in the area of climate change. He said, “We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period,” Deming told the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. (Interesting side note: When you click on the link to Deming’s 2002 testimony, the browser says, “Page cannot be found.” Question: Has it been purged, and if so, why?) “When you’re willing to manipulate data you can show any result you want, and they wanted to show warming,” Heller concluded. British economist Ronald Coase once quipped, “Torture the data, and it will confess to anything.” While Coase’s quote was about economics, it definitely applies to natural science as well. As Heller’s well-researched charts show, today’s climate-alarmist scientists are more than willing to “torture” the data to achieve their desired results. There are several examples of doctored historical temperature data. Besides NASA, we know that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has done it. We know that the HadCRUT 4 data used by the UNIPCC contained at least 70 obvious errors, according to a 2018 audit by climate-data researcher Dr. John Mclean. And the data tampering isn’t limited to temperature either. Sea-level rise data is tampered with as well. The willingness of scientists such as Mann and others to completely change historical data to show rapid warming is scientific quackery of the highest order. And that willingness doesn’t just make them bad scientists; it makes them liars.

104f03d3,"Contractors bidding for work with the government are being asked to affirm that they back Brexit. Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade DIT has inserted a clause into advertisements inviting tech companies to bid for work, saying that in order to have the right “cultural fit” for the task, they must “be committed to the best possible outcome for the United Kingdom following its departure from the European Union”. Pro-Brexit ministers have sometimes been frustrated by civil servants’ lack of enthusiasm for the complex task of unpicking Britain’s close relationship with the EU and appear to be determined to hire firms that share their optimism. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and prominent leave campaigner, used a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday to condemn “droning and moaning” about the risks of leaving the EU. Last December, contractor Deloitte apologised after details of a damning report it had written about Downing Street’s plans for handling the article 50 process were leaked. The company also agreed to pull out of bidding for government contracts for six months. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “The Conservative Brexit government demanding there must be a ‘cultural fit’ is straight out of the pages of Nineteen Eighty-Four. “The private opinions of government employees have always been their own business. Now they are required to support Brexit, will they have to support the Tories too?” Farron added: “Professionals will always strive for the best outcomes in their work without being told how they should and shouldn’t think.” The ‘cultural fit’ requirement in two advertisements for short-term digital contracts. Photograph: Gov.uk The “cultural fit” requirement appears in two government advertisements for short-term digital contracts. One invites bids from firms to “investigate the feasibility of designing a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers”; another is for “investigating the feasibility of creating certain services around trade remedies as trade legislation is transferred from the EU to the UK”. As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50, the two new government departments she set up to oversee the process – DIT and the Department for Exiting the European Union – are both hiring staff and contractors. The requirement to back the best deal for Britain is one of a list of criteria applicants for the two DIT contracts are asked to fulfil, alongside being “focused enough to stick to the task at hand”, “committed and hard-working” and “enthused by the prospect of working at the frontline in such an exciting and dynamic area”. In total, these “cultural fit” criteria will be given a 15% weighting in assessing which company to pick, the ads say. Academics and former senior civil servants have repeatedly warned about the complexity of the task facing politicians in extricating Britain from the EU, with one thinktank, UK in a Changing Europe, warning recently that it could overwhelm the capacities of the state; but these sceptics have often been accused of trying to “block Brexit”. Fox cannot yet draw up new trade deals because the UK will continue to trade under existing arrangements while it remains a member of the EU. But he has been travelling the world in a process his advisers call “pitch-rolling” for new deals that can be signed as soon as possible after Brexit. Article 50 kicks off a two-year process of negotiations with the other 27 EU member states. May has repeatedly said she intends to invoke it before the end of March. A DIT spokesperson said: “Ongoing recruitment is enabling us to build a team from the widest pool of talent in the civil service and externally, across a range of policy and corporate expertise and international experience. “The contract advertised is for a team to design a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers. “They will be required to act with objectivity and impartiality under the civil service code.”",Firms bidding for government contracts asked if they back Brexit,other
92f7f33e,"38 SHARES LinkedIn Email Reddit Telegram Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting. According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week. BYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Email * From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS. The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day. “We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said. According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed. The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week. Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting. It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL. Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy. In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates. Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?” The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history. During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment. “I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said. “Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said. Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country. In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.",Google search spike post-Brexit suggests people don't know why they voted to leave,FALSE

A tarp obscures the name of the USS John S. McCain ahead of President Trump's visit to Japan. The White House wanted the U.S. Navy to move “out of sight” the warship USS John S. McCain ahead of President Trump’s visit to Japan, according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The ship was named after the father and grandfather of the late senator—a war hero who became a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s ire—and the senator’s name was added to the ship in 2018. In a May 15 email to U.S. Navy and Air Force officials, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official outlined plans for the president’s arrival that he said had resulted from conversations between the White House Military Office and the Seventh Fleet of the U.S. Navy. In addition to instructions for the proper landing areas for helicopters and preparation for the USS Wasp—where the president was scheduled to speak—the official issued a third directive: “USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.” “Please confirm #3 will be satisfied,” the official wrote.

9d3ac1f0,"Three in four labour wards have no consultants overnight. A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. And just two out of 165 maternity units had a consultant present round the clock, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Scroll down for video A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. Stock image Mothers-to-be are instead left in the hands of overstretched midwives and inexperienced and often exhausted junior doctors. Although consultants are on call from home, they can live up to 30 minutes away and staff summon them only in emergencies. More than half of births take place out of hours. And research shows that babies born then are a third more likely to die or suffer serious complications. The royal college obtained the figures from 165 NHS maternity units – 82 per cent of the total. They show that: Just over 73 per cent had no consultants on the weekday overnight shift, typically 10pm to 8am; Another 43 per cent said none were on site at weekends; 89 per cent said consultants were not present for evening shifts at weekends; Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham and Central Manchester University were the only centres with consultants day and night, all week. Maureen Treadwell, of the Birth Trauma Association, said: ‘We are concerned at the number of hospital trusts with no consultant cover at night. ‘There are a number of rare but sudden catastrophic events in labour where a less experienced doctor may need the advice or assistance of a senior colleague. ‘These are not common events, but every year some women and babies will die as a result of substandard care, often from staff who are doing their best, but may never have dealt with such a condition.’ The figures are worrying because labours are becoming more complex due to obesity and the trend for women to have babies later in life. Experts say midwives and junior doctors are less likely to spot when things go wrong and can be reluctant to summon the help of consultants. Labour wards are also under pressure because of high birth rates fuelled by migration. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said it shows that the Tories can;t even deliver a five-day NHS Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is crucial that maternity units are sufficiently staffed to provide a high level of care to all who use them – day or night. ‘The Tories talk about a seven-day NHS but these figures show they can’t even deliver a five-day NHS.’ Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘Women need safe maternity services whenever they give birth. We know more needs to be done to provide the right level of staff to give support when necessary.’ The royal college issued recommendations in 2009 stating that maternity units should work toward having consultants present round the clock. This would improve the care of women and the training of junior staff, the guidelines stated. Consultants are supposed to supervise the care of all patients in maternity units and intervene if something goes wrong. A major study by Imperial College London last year found that babies delivered at the weekend were 7 per cent more likely to be stillborn. And research published by Cambridge University in 2010 found that babies born overnight or at weekends in Scottish hospitals were a third more likely to die. MY BABY WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I'D HAD HER IN THE WEEK Angela Owens pictured with baby Hope believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday Angela Owens believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday. She was two weeks overdue when she felt severe and sudden pain on a Saturday afternoon four days before Christmas 2013. The 31-year-old went to the labour ward at Warrington Hospital, describing it as a ghost town. Midwives repeatedly told her to go home and take paracetamol – and ignored her pleas for a consultant. Eventually – after her GP brother arrived – they bleeped the consultant but by this stage it was too late. When Ella was finally delivered on 11pm on the Saturday she was stillborn. The mother, who has two other daughters with her partner Paul, said: ‘There was a general flippant attitude towards me,’ ‘You put your trust in health staff in these situations, but I had to beg them for help. ‘Hospitals seem to go into sleep mode at the weekends and for us this resulted in the ultimate tragedy. It was horrendous. I will never recover from her death.’ Ella was one of ten babies who had been stillborn or died in unexplained circumstances at Warrington Hospital in a 12-month period between 2013/14. The deaths were avoidable and blamed on staffing shortages – half occurred at weekends. Advertisement The authors said the same would be true for English hospitals. They blamed the extra risks on a lack of intervention by junior doctors. NHS figures show that doctors performed almost 40 per cent of births in 2014/15 and midwives do most of the remainder. They do not state whether the former were consultants or junior doctors. But the figure has steadily increased from 24 per cent in 1989. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Having a baby is now safer than it has ever been and the vast majority of mothers report that they get great NHS maternity care.’ The spokesman highlighted a study last year that claimed there was no evidence to show overnight consultants made any difference to safety. But he refused to acknowledge other research showing babies born out of hours were more likely to die.

fa3d9cdb,"There is absolutely no compelling reason for the State of Wisconsin to allow slavery. Period. But did you know slavery is still allowable under Wisconsin law as long as it’s a punishment for a crime? Not if I have anything to say about it. Next legislative session, I am reintroducing my slavery ban. My ban would eliminate the last 15 words of Article I, Section 2 of Wisconsin’s Constitution, “There shall be neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude in this state. It’s also federal law. The 13th amendment to the US Constitution says, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States…” On Friday, October 7th, Netflix released a documentary called “13th” to highlight the growth of the black prison population and to remind us all that slavery is still possible in America. I don’t care what you do or who you are, nobody deserves a life of enslavement. Nobody gets to own another person. I hope we can all agree on that. In practice, this amendment allows our prisons to exploit incarcerated individuals and force them to work without pay. Now I need to be clear on one thing – Wisconsin’s Department of Corrections does not currently use slave labor. But they could. And they would be fully within their legal rights to do so. What does it say about our society that we still allow slavery? It makes me sick. I don’t know about you but I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired. And when I get angry, I do something about it. My constitutional amendment would have to pass the next two legislative sessions and then it could appear on the 2020 ballot where the people of Wisconsin would get to have their say and vote ‘no’ on slavery. Now I know that’s a long time, but the problem of mass incarceration isn’t getting any better, and it’s a problem that deeply affects our community. With 53206 being the most heavily incarcerated zip code in America and 62% of our adult men having spent time behind bars, it’s on us to put an end to hatred in our laws. Despite making up only 13.2% of the total US population, African-Americans constitute 37% of the prison population. That means the chance to be enslaved disproportionately impacts the black community. That’s not the only thing that disproportionately impacts the black community: We are over-policed. We are pulled over at higher rates, we’re subjected to searches at higher rates, and we die at the hands of police at higher rates. We are over-charged. Though white folks use drugs at five times the rate of the black community, we are charged with drug offenses at ten times the rate. We are over-sentenced. Studies have shown that black people on average serve the same amount of time in prison for a drug offense that a white person does for a violent offense.

Also on rt.com Russiagate diehards can’t let the collusion narrative go, come up with new theories instead Sanchez claimed “truth was the real take-away” from the report, given that there was no evidence of Russian collusion and despite this lack of evidence, so many MSM journalists readily participated in Russiagate, leaving real stories untold in their pursuit of this “trail to nowhere.” Instead, Sanchez explained that the “demonization of Russia” is used to drive the “most powerful industry in the history of the world” – US weapons. “Using a complicit media, the arms industry rakes in billions and billions of dollars simply convincing us and other countries all over the world that they need protection from Russia,” said Sanchez. “Whether Russia really poses a threat or not doesn’t really matter.” You can watch Sanchez’s response to Russiagate in full here: READ MORE: ICYMI: Mueller’s collusion delusion: US media is furious their president isn’t a Russian spy VIDEO Like this story?

7be6b208,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden is ""considering"" forgiving $50,000 in federal student loan debt for every borrower with an annual salary of under $125,000 — a move that would place an incredibly heavy burden on taxpayers. More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? ""We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president,"" Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. ""You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. ""I have told him how important it is. He is considering it,"" Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. ""We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does."" During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. ""What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans?"" the reporter asked. ""Look,"" Schumer responded, ""lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished."" After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the ""Fox News perspective"" on the issue. ""These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it,"" Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, ""'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone"" and ""in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers.""","Scottish Parliament should return to business, say Tories",other
9ae080ef,"PM to set out his vision for a “truly twenty-first century” prison system, while calling for prison reform to be one of the “great progressive causes” of British politics Six new ‘reform prisons’ to be created this year, with full autonomy over how they operate and spend their budget Prison education system will also be completely transformed with full control being given to ‘reform prison’ governors, while protecting the £130m per year budget The Prime Minister is expected to slam the ‘scandalous failure’ of the prisons sector later today as he outlines his vision for a modern, more effective, truly twenty-first century prison system. Giving the first speech purely focused on prisons by a British PM in more than 2 decades, he will outline plans to give prison governors complete control over the way they run their prisons, which will empower staff, drive up standards and cut reoffending. He will promise 6 of these new ‘reform prisons’ by the end of the year and through a new Prisons Bill in the next session, has vowed to unleash these principles across the prisons system. The Prime Minister is expected to say: It can be easy for us all – when prisons are closed off by high walls and barbed wire – to adopt an “out of sight, out of mind” attitude. I want this government to be different. When I say we will tackle our deepest social problems and extend life chances, I want there to be no no-go areas. And that includes the 121 prisons in our country, where our social problems are most acute and people’s life chances are most absent. So I want to explain why I believe prison reform should be a great progressive cause in British politics and to set out my vision for a modern, more effective, truly twenty-first century prison system. My starting point is this: we need prisons. Some people – including, of course, rapists, murderers, child abusers, gang leaders – belong in them. For me, punishment – that deprivation of liberty – is not a dirty word. I never want us to forget that it is the victims of crime who should always be our principal priority. And I am not unrealistic or starry-eyed about what prisons can achieve. Not everyone shows remorse and not everyone seeks redemption. But I also strongly believe that we must offer chances to change; that for those trying hard to turn themselves around, we should offer hope; that in a compassionate country, we should help those who’ve made mistakes to find their way back onto the right path. In short: we need a prison system that doesn’t see prisoners as simply liabilities to be managed, but instead as potential assets to be harnessed. But the failure of our system today is scandalous. 46% of all prisoners will re-offend within a year of release. 60% of short-sentenced prisoners will reoffend within the same period. And current levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm should shame us all. In a typical week, there will be almost 600 incidents of self-harm; at least one suicide; and 350 assaults, including 90 on staff. This failure really matters. It matters to the public purse: this cycle of reoffending costs up to £13 billion a year. It matters to you: because in the end, who are the victims of this re-offending? It’s the mother who gets burgled or the young boy who gets mugged. It matters to the prison staff – some of the most deeply committed public servants in our country – who have to work in dangerous and intimidating conditions. And yes, it matters to the prisoners themselves, who mustn’t feel like society has totally given up on them. I’m clear: we need wholesale reform. And I am convinced that with the right agenda, we can be world leaders in change just like we have been in welfare, just like in education we can demonstrate that with the right reforms, we can make a lasting difference to people in our society. The PM will also announce a drive to make our prisons more transparent in terms of how they operate, by developing proper data and meaningful metrics so we can easily compare prison performance. This could include measuring individual institutions’ reoffending levels, employment outcomes after release, place of residence following release and progress made on basic literacy and key skills. Alongside this, the PM will also confirm that the government will soon be publishing Dame Sally Coates’ review of prison education, where she will recommend the end to regional contracts and instead advises giving much greater control of education to prison governors. The recommendation, which has been accepted in full by the government, will be backed further by the government promising to protect prison education budgets in cash terms, with £130 million per year. And David Laws has agreed to chair a new social enterprise and work with Dame Sally Coates and organisations such as Teach First to develop a new scheme that will recruit high quality graduates who will transform prisons into places of rehabilitation and learning. David Laws said: I am a firm believer in the power of education and have seen first-hand the difference great teachers can make. I look forward to working with Dame Sally Coates to establish a graduate scheme that will help to support our vision of placing high quality education at the heart of the prison regime. Brett Wigdortz OBE, Founder & CEO of Teach First said: Over the last 13 years Teach First has, with our school and university partners, developed expertise in attracting and mobilising talented leaders to support and inspire the least advantaged in society. Like so many, we know that too often there is a link between low achievement at school and the prison population. I am therefore delighted to be able to share our knowledge of attracting talented individuals to key professions that transform the lives of those facing the greatest barriers.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaking with Iranian officials including his counterpart, Javad Zarif, after the agreement was reached in Vienna in July 2015. WASHINGTON—The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward. Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said. The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran’s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. “With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,” President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17—without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.","USA repeats as World Cup champions, beating Netherlands 2-0",partially false
50ada21f,"I have just been to Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty The Queen has asked me to form a new government, and I accepted. In David Cameron, I follow in the footsteps of a great, modern Prime Minister. Under David’s leadership, the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit, and helped more people into work than ever before. But David’s true legacy is not about the economy but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage, to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether; David Cameron has led a one-nation government, and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead. Because not everybody knows this, but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist Party, and that word ‘unionist’ is very important to me. It means we believe in the Union: the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it means something else that is just as important; it means we believe in a union not just between the nations of the United Kingdom but between all of our citizens, every one of us, whoever we are and wherever we’re from. That means fighting against the burning injustice that, if you’re born poor, you will die on average 9 years earlier than others. If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white. If you’re a white, working-class boy, you’re less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university. If you’re at a state school, you’re less likely to reach the top professions than if you’re educated privately. If you’re a woman, you will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there’s not enough help to hand. If you’re young, you’ll find it harder than ever before to own your own home. But the mission to make Britain a country that works for everyone means more than fighting these injustices. If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security. You have your own home, but you worry about paying a mortgage. You can just about manage but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school. If you’re one of those families, if you’re just managing, I want to address you directly. I know you’re working around the clock, I know you’re doing your best, and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle. The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws, we’ll listen not to the mighty but to you. When it comes to taxes, we’ll prioritise not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won’t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you. We are living through an important moment in our country’s history. Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change. And I know because we’re Great Britain, that we will rise to the challenge. As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us. That will be the mission of the government I lead, and together we will build a better Britain.","Exclusive: Russian losses in Syria jump in 2017, Reuters estimates show",TRUE
e8875ff6,"A Utah-based left-wing activist is facing criminal charges for allegedly participating in the Capitol Hill riot last week. John Sullivan, who is the founder of Insurgence USA — a social justice group he started after the death of George Floyd — was arrested and charged in federal court in Washington, DC, according to a report by Salt Lake Tribune. An affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant alleges Sullivan “knowingly and willfully joined a crowd of individuals who forcibly entered the U.S. Capitol and impeded, disrupted, and disturbed the orderly conduct of business” by the U.S. House and Senate. While Sullivan claims he attended last week’s “Stop the Steal” march as a journalist, the affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Matthew Foulger says otherwise. The criminal complaint reads: At various times, Sullivan has claimed to be a journalist. He has admitted, however, that he has no press credentials and the investigation has not revealed any connection between Sullivan and any journalistic organizations. In the affidavit, Foulger goes on to detail videos — that Sullivan provided to the FBI — in which the left-wing activist can allegedly be heard encouraging protesters inside and around the Capitol Building. In one video, Sullivan can be heard — as he approaches the Capitol Building with others — saying, “There are so many people. Let’s go. This shit is ours! Fuck yeah,” “We accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history,” and “Let’s burn this shit down.” The affidavit adds that while walking through the Capitol, Sullivan can also be heard saying, “it’s our house motherfuckers,” and “we are getting this shit.” “In at least two encounters, Sullivan can be heard on the video arguing with the officers, telling them to stand down so that they do not get hurt,” reads the criminal complaint. “At one point in the video, Sullivan enters an office within the U.S. Capitol — once inside the office, Sullivan approaches a window — and states, ‘We did this shit. We took this shit.'” the affidavit adds. The criminal complaint goes on to say that at one point, “a knocking noise is heard off-screen. The camera then pans to show more of the window and a broken pane can be seen that was not broken on Sullivan’s approach to the window.” “Sullivan can then be heard saying, ‘I broke it. My bad, my apologies. Well they already broke a window, so, you know, I didn’t know I hit it that hard. No one got that on camera,'” the affidavit continues. “Eventually, individuals in the crowd outside the doors announce that the officers are leaving and ‘giving us the building,'” the affidavit adds. “As the crowd begins to part so the officers can leave, Sullivan can be heard saying, ‘Haul that motherfucker out this bitch.'” At another point in the video, Sullivan is walking down a hallway inside the Capitol Building with a large group of people, and can be heard saying, “Why don’t we go in there” as he pans the camera to a closed door. Then, after someone hits the door, Sullivan can be heard saying, “That’s what I’m sayin’, break that shit.” The affidavit goes on to detail several other examples of Sullivan’s conduct on Capitol Hill that day, adding the activist had also posted some of the videos to social media, under the pseudonym JaydenX. The criminal complaint also notes Sullivan was charged with “Rioting and Criminal Mischief” over the summer by local law enforcement authorities in Provo, Utah. The arrest was in connection with a June protest in which one person was shot and injured. The case is still pending. For his actions on January 6, the left-wing activist faces federal charges of civil disorder, entering a restricted building or grounds, and violent entry or disorderly conduct.",Foreign Ministry comments on US anti-Russian sanctions over Skripal case,other

a99a84ae,"Scott Walker celebrates with supporters. (Darren Hauck/Getty) Why it was the most important GOP victory in the country The most important election in the country yesterday was the gubernatorial race in Wisconsin. In its historic implications, Scott Walker’s victory was on a par with the GOP’s winning control of the Senate, arguably as important as all the other gubernatorial and congressional elections put together. And the reasons have nothing to do with his presidential prospects. Walker has now proven that his reforms in Wisconsin are both a model for conservative reform and a winning electoral strategy. But those reforms still have a long way to go. The crucial question was whether Wisconsin’s voters were going to give him the chance to keep pushing. Advertisement Walker came to office inspired by the advice of Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana, who told him to think bold and strike fast. The spearhead of Walker’s reform agenda was Act 10, which broke the stranglehold of public-sector unions on Wisconsin’s deplorable finances. Act 10 essentially turned Wisconsin, one of the leading lights of the labor-union movement, into a right-to-work state. (Wisconsin is still technically a union state with respect to the National Labor Relations Act, but private-sector unions in Wisconsin have waned to the point of irrelevance, so the major union presence was in the public sector.) The challenge Walker faced was that reforms take time to work, and – initially, at least — generate much more opposition than support. His approval ratings in Wisconsin plunged to 37 percent as the venomous reaction of entrenched special interests (in this case, public-sector unions) took its toll. Those special interests enjoyed enormous political support both in Wisconsin and across the country, and Walker had only four years to demonstrate that the benefits of conservative reform could outweigh that support among moderates and independents. Advertisement Progressives correctly identified the threat that Walker represents to them nationally. If the most sacred privileges of their special interests could be undone in the birthplace of progressivism, those perks wouldn’t be safe anywhere in the country. But if Walker had lost, it would have meant that sweeping conservative reforms of government would face uncertain prospects in virtually every state and at the national level. Governor Mitch Daniels succeeded in reforming Indiana, but he was in many ways sui generis. Now, however, what Daniels did in Indiana has been replicated in Wisconsin. The birthplace of progressivism, the Midwestern heartland, is becoming the birthplace of a new conservatism — a conservatism not just of limited government but of good government; not just pro-business but pro-competition, a conservatism bent on defending the common man from the rapacious rule of special interests. It’s a conservatism that can be true to its principles and still appeal to moderates, independents, and even Democrats. Indeed, a large number of Wisconsin voters have voted twice for Obama and twice for Walker. Walker was undoubtedly helped in this race by the neighboring example of Illinois, where Governor Pat Quinn has been busy demonstrating in Technicolor the flaws of progressive government. The Left explains Walker’s victory in terms of outside forces (read: Koch brothers) who influenced the election with their money. But no combination of cabals and conspiracies and evil corporations could have come close to helping Walker as much as the Democratic government of Illinois. There’s an even more important reason that Walker’s victory matters. A century of progressivism has left Wisconsin in a very deep hole. When Walker got to office, Wisconsin was one of the worst states in the country in which to do business, with one of the highest regulatory and tax burdens. Some estimates now rate it as No. 14 for doing business, but don’t be deceived. Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden. Freed from the shackles of heavy government, Wisconsin’s superbly productive labor force could transform it into one of the country’s leading economies — a “Texas model” for purple states. Advertisement Walker has a long way to go in proving that conservative reforms can work in the long term. For the moment, Wisconsin’s conservatives, moderates, and independents have decided to give him another term. Here’s hoping he doesn’t rest on his laurels, and instead once again thinks bold and strikes fast, as he did four years ago. — Mario Loyola, a contributing editor at National Review, is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin in Madison.",National Review,partially false

Celia Israel Disappointed in Court Ruling Finding School Finance System Unconstitutional, Calls for Immediate Special Session Austin - Rep. Celia Israel (D-Travis County) is asking Gov.

""I am extremely disappointed in the ruling today from the Texas Supreme Court. It was especially surprising to see the court label our system 'Byzantine' and 'meeting minimal standards' at the same time."" Israel said. ""Texas deserves better. We cannot continue to crow about our economic growth and continue to act as if a 'Byzantine' system serves our children and our future well. I call upon Governor Abbott to immediately call a Special Session so Texas can fully invest in its education system."" Israel expressed disappointment in the Court's ruling striking down Judge John Dietz's finding lawmakers ignored the real costs of education and the impact of the significant cuts made during the 2011 Session, all the while raising standards for Texas students and requiring schools to provide more elaborate programs. The Court's ruling appears to leave the Legislature as the last word as to whether Texas is fulfilling its constitutional mandate to ""make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public schools."" When adjusted for inflation, per student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003. It would take an additional $3.5 billion next biennium just to get our schools where they were 14 years ago. At the same time, state support for public schools continues to fall behind the cost of inflation, does not account for changes in student needs or academic standards, and fails to fund equitably between districts. ""It's time for big ideas and Texas-sized leadership,"" Israel said, noting her constituents will no longer accept the ""business as usual"" approach to education funding, even with the Court's ruling.

d810afbd,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 30, 2013 Contact: Rebecca Acuña Wendy R. Davis for Governor Campaign Davis: Perry Should Fire William White Fort Worth, TX: Senator Wendy Davis today called on Governor Rick Perry to remove William White as Chairman of the Finance Commission of Texas in the wake of controversial statements made by White to the El Paso Times. White’s position oversees the Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner, the agency charged with protecting Texas consumers. In a blatant conflict of interest, William White, a Vice President for Cash America International, defended his employer instead of Texas consumers in an interview with the newspaper. Cash America is a payday lender that was fined $19 million dollars by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last month for abusive practices. “Texans are tired of backroom deals and dishonesty in Austin,” said Senator Wendy Davis. “William White can’t protect Texas consumers while he represents a predatory lending company on the side. Mr. White should resign from his post – and if he won’t, Governor Perry should remove him.” A 2006 Department of Defense study concluded that payday lending and other high-cost lending products are a threat to military readiness and destructive to the morale of troops on active deployment. The President of the Navy Marine Corps Relief Society called payday lending in particular “the most serious single financial problem that we have encountered in [a] hundred years.” This isn’t the first time Sen. Davis pointed to William White’s conflict of interest. In 2011, Senator Davis called White’s appointment to the commission, “the classic fox in the henhouse.” She said, “It’s really disgusting that an industry that profits from the poor by charging 1,000-plus interest is put at the head of the state’s financial regulatory agency. It’s saying, ‘It’s not only OK, but we’re going to put them in charge.’ ” Sen. Davis has been a champion for payday lending reform since joining the Texas Senate in 2009. She has filed multiple bills targeted at reform. Senator Davis has filed legislation that would close the credit service organization loophole, limit the interest rate charged to U.S. military members and their dependents, and cap the interest payday lenders can charge. Both the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission and the Texas Catholic Conference have applauded Senator Davis in her work to reduce payday lending. In 2012, the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission presented Senator Wendy Davis with the Horizon Award to recognize her work to curb predatory lending practices in Texas. ###","US pastor, who believes floods are God's punishment, flees flooded home",partially false
9508602d,"TYLER, TX (KLTV) - A group of demonstrators gathered Tuesday on the square in Tyler to push for immigration and health care reform. The group goes by Indivisible of Smith County and called for a town hall meeting with Rep. Louie Gohmert. Gohmert was dining at nearby Jack Ryan's during the demonstration. He responded Tuesday afternoon, issuing the following statement: The communication below is being sent to those constituents who have demanded a public town hall meeting mainly for the purpose of letting the Congressman know they want to keep Obamacare. Dear Fellow East Texans: Thank you for your recent request to my office for a town hall meeting. Having traveled the entirety of our district so many times during my time in Congress, doing thousands of events and public appearances, such as veterans’ ceremonies, hospice medal presentations, church sermons with meet/greet, job site tours, charity dinner talks, public hearings, speeches to big groups/small groups with question/answer time, constituent meetings, media interviews, op-eds, constituent phone calls, ribbon cuttings, business forums, job fairs, district art competitions, school assemblies, classroom caucuses, flag presentation ceremonies, VA clinic visits, business openings, environmental field hearings, chamber banquets, judicial conferences, farming symposia, rodeos, town meetings, big/small town hall meetings, tele-town hall meetings, as well as constituent meetings when in Washington, I feel confident there are very few voters who pay attention in the 1st Congressional District of Texas who don’t know exactly where I stand on the issues and why—especially regarding the issue of Obamacare. In fact, in November, over a quarter of a million people were polled, and 73.9% said they agreed with me. I made clear for the last seven years that I would do all I could to repeal Obamacare. I was one of the few who read it before I voted. Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety. Threats are nothing new to me and I have gotten my share as a felony judge. However, the House Sergeant at Arms advised us after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot at a public appearance, that civilian attendees at Congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killed—just as happened there. One Congressional friend had one of his district staff members knocked unconscious and hospitalized this past week after being overrun by a group intent on physical confrontation and disruption. In the same amount of time it takes to have a town hall meeting, which usually has between 30 and 100 attendees in east Texas, I can communicate with thousands of my constituent bosses through a telephone town hall meeting. This technology allows the inclusion of our disabled and more elderly seniors who have opinions but who could not otherwise come to an actual town hall meeting and ask questions. The telephone company assures us that all of the people participating on our telephone town halls live right here in east Texas and I will have likely have had over one hundred thousand people in our district participate by the time I finish this new round. Then, when the threat of violence at town hall meetings recedes, we can go back to having the civil town hall meetings I’ve had in the past to supplement the masses reached in our telephone town halls. I very much appreciate hearing from the most vocal who form part of the very important twenty-six percent who disagreed with my seven year position on Obamacare, and I really believe that if we do the right things after repealing Obamacare, that even most of those who like government control of their lives in Obamacare, will acknowledge that things are better with more personal choices at a lower price, and without the massive cuts to Medicare and our seniors’ healthcare that Obamacare inflicted. Just this past week I have had two telephone town halls which included asking questions of constituents and getting those polling results that are absolutely consistent with the ultimate poll that was taken on Election Day just three and a half months ago. It should not be surprising that thus far, the results on the most politically sensitive issues show that the views I have been standing firm on are consistent with the 74% of voting east Texans that believed in November that I best reflected their beliefs and wishes. We have also noted that a manual from one of the groups demanding town halls so they can disrupt them with agitators, suggested such underhanded motivations such as: “Stall the Trump agenda by forcing them to redirect energy away from their priorities.” “A day they spend worrying about you is a day that they’re not… preparing a Muslim registry.” (By the way, I do not support a “Muslim registry”!) “Tactics for these events may be similar to more traditional protests, where you’re trying to shift attention from the scheduled event to your own message.” Statements like this in their community organizing materials are not “non-partisan,” as they their playbook tells them to claim that they are. Some public town halls from this particular group recently boasted having agitators even come in from other states to cause havoc. I understand you personally do not want violence, but just want to be heard. I hear you. As a servant of east Texas, your input continues to be vital to me. That’s why I put over 80,000 miles on my car in about two years repeatedly getting to every part of our east Texas district. So, thank you very much for your input. Though I am saddened if you are upset with my positions, they do appear to reflect a majority of east Texans’ views but I will continue to monitor closely. Regardless, I sincerely hope this week that you will find joy in the faces of those you love.","Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses. How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim. The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.” Dr. Anthony FauciThis means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.” Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus. He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.” The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms. But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas. Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2. On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings. “Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.” Said Dr. Zelenko: ""If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good. All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting."" The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms. While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.” So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died. This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934. Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem. So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over. Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic. It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment? There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word. Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world.",FALSE
20968b72,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry says he does not believe CO2 emissions from human activity are the primary driver of climate change. That view is at odds with the conclusions of the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt also told CNBC in March he does not believe global warming is primarily caused by CO2. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC on Monday he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions from human activity are the main driver of climate change, joining the EPA administrator in casting doubt on the conclusion of some of the government’s WB_wombat_top scientists. Asked whether CO2 emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, Perry told CNBC’s “Squawk Box”: “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.” “The fact is this shouldn’t be a debate about, ‘Is the climate changing, is man having an effect on it?’ Yeah, we are. The question should be just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to effect that?” he said. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told “Squawk Box” he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming. Those statements contradict the public stance of the Environmental Protection Agency, at least until recently. Sec. Perry: Bringing back nuclear energy The EPA’s webpage on the causes of climate change used to state, “Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.” The EPA recently took down the web page containing that statement. Perry and Pruitt’s views are also at odds with the conclusion of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Despite those conclusions, Perry said, “This idea that science is just absolutely settled and if you don’t believe it’s settled then somehow you’re another neanderthal, that is so inappropriate from my perspective.” Being a skeptic about climate change issues is “quite all right,” he said, suggesting that skepticism is a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.” President Donald Trump announced this month he would pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, an international effort to mitigate the effects of global warming. Since then, most of the president’s surrogates have declined to say whether he believes in climate change. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the Department of Energy’s funding. The Energy Department is shutting down the Office of International Climate and Technology, which works with other countries to develop clean energy technology, The New York Times reported last week. Under Trump, the United States has also backed away from a pledge to double research and development spending on energy technology to $6.4 billion by 2021.","UK university applications fall by 4%, Ucas figures show",FALSE
0b4320b2,"In March, the North Carolina Legislature went into special session and passed House Bill 2 in a single day. This legislation targets lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT, people for discrimination. Within hours of the bill’s passage, Gov. Patrick “Pat” McCrory (R) signed it into law, giving North Carolina the dubious distinction of enacting what some are calling the most anti-LGBT legislation ever passed. H.B. 2 was introduced in response to the city of Charlotte’s passage of an LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination ordinance, following the lead of roughly 200 other localities across the country. Specifically, H.B. 2 rescinds LGBT nondiscrimination protections passed by Charlotte and several other North Carolina cities, bans them from passing future protections, and requires all government facilities in the state, including schools, to bar transgender people from using restrooms in accordance with their gender identities. In response, businesses quickly announced their opposition. More than 130 business leaders from across the country signed a letter to Gov. McCrory stating that H.B. 2 will “diminish the state’s draw as a destination for tourism, new businesses, and economic activity.” The NBA expressed concern over what it called a “discriminatory law” and indicated that it may move the 2017 All-Star Game and weekend out of the state. On April 5, PayPal announced the withdrawal of plans for a new global operations center in North Carolina, which was expected to bring 400 skilled jobs to the state. Recently, Gov. McCrory released an executive order banning anti-LGBT discrimination for state employees. The order, however, does nothing to address the most harmful components of H.B. 2, such as leaving municipalities without protections throughout daily life and continuing to ban transgender people from restrooms that correspond with their gender identity, including the very same state employees McCrory now claims to protect. The only way for the state to regain its economic footing and restore its image is to repeal H.B. 2 in full and pass comprehensive LGBT nondiscrimination protections. Based on publicly available estimates of the economic impact of lost or at-risk business activity or events, the North Carolina economy could potentially lose out on more than $567.5 million in private-sector economic activity through 2018. Lost pending repeal of H.B. 2: At risk pending repeal of H.B. 2: Note: Some estimates of economic impact are based on similar events in other states or in previous years. These totals do not include several entities that have announced that they will not do business in North Carolina but do not currently have events or work planned in the state. Major television studios, including Fox, A+E Studios, and Turner Broadcasting, have announced that they will not consider North Carolina for future filming if the law is not repealed. Two projects by A+E and Turner that are currently filming in North Carolina are expected to have direct in-state spending of more than $57 million. Google Ventures—an investment firm that manages $2.4 billion in assets—has pledged not to back any companies from the state; this is at a time when North Carolina’s emerging biotech and life sciences sector is ripe for investment. H.B. 2 could also cost North Carolina billions of dollars in federal funding. The law requires all public schools and all other state and local government agencies in North Carolina to discriminate against transgender students, patients, and workers in violation of federal protections. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx announced that his office is reviewing the potential removal of North Carolina’s federal transportation funding, which totals roughly $1.2 billion and makes up more than one-quarter of the state’s transportation budget. A similar review is being conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, which provided $4.3 billion in funding to the state in 2015. Spokeswoman Dorie Nolt announced that the department “will not hesitate to act if students’ civil rights are being violated.” The public outcry from H.B. 2 comes roughly a year after Indiana passed an overly broad Religious Freedom Restoration Act before reversing course. The nationwide economic boycott of Indiana lost or put at risk more than $250 million for the state. The economic impact of discrimination as underscored by harmful legislation such as H.B. 2 is yet another reason why LGBT people need to be fully included in U.S. communities.

The WHO’s top brass made this announcement during a special session of the WHO’s 34-member executive board on Monday October 5th, it’s just nobody seemed to really understand it. In fact, they didn’t seem to completely understand it themselves. At the session, Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO’s Head of Emergencies revealed that they believe roughly 10% of the world has been infected with Sars-Cov-2. This is their “best estimate”, and a huge increase over the number of officially recognised cases (around 35 million). Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, later confirmed the figure, stating it was based on the average results of all the broad seroprevalence studies done around the world. As much as the WHO were attempting to spin this as a bad thing – Dr Ryan even said it means “the vast majority of the world remains at risk.” – it’s actually good news. And confirms, once more, that the virus is nothing like as deadly as everyone predicted. The global population is roughly 7.8 billion people, if 10% have been infected that is 780 million cases. The global death toll currently attributed to Sars-Cov-2 infections is 1,061,539. That’s an infection fatality rate of roughly or 0.14%. Right in line with seasonal flu and the predictions of many experts from all around the world. 0.14% is over 24 times LOWER than the WHO’s “provisional figure” of 3.4% back in March. This figure was used in the models which were used to justify lockdowns and other draconian policies. In fact, given the over-reporting of alleged Covid deaths, the IFR is likely even lower than 0.14%, and could show Covid to be much less dangerous than flu. None of the mainstream press picked up on this. Though many outlets reported Dr Ryan’s words, they all attempted to make it a scary headline and spread more panic. Apparently neither they, nor the WHO, were capable of doing the simple math that shows us this is good news. And that the Covid sceptics have been right all along.",TRUE

In 2010, some 2.2 million of Britain’s 28.2 million employees were migrants with just 1.1 million coming from Europe. By last year, 3.4 million from a workforce of 30.3 million were born abroad, with 2.2 million arriving from the EU bloc and 1.2 million from the rest of the world. Anti-EU critics said years of Britain’s “open borders” policy was behind the rapid rise and the reason voters chose Leave at last year’s referendum. Independent MEP Steven Woolfe said: “These figures are a portrayal of long-term, mass uncontrolled migration from the EU.

da2b6121,"Anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-education: In a disturbing development the Ohio House has passed legislation that would allow students to give wrong answers and not be penalized if those wrong answers are based on the student’s “sincerely held religious belief.” Cleveland.com reports: The Ohio House sent to the Senate on Wednesday a measure that would prohibit public schools from penalizing students for some work that contains religious beliefs. Critics have called the bill unnecessary or valuing religion over secularism… WKRC reports: The Ohio House on Wednesday passed the “Student Religious Liberties Act.” Under the law, students can’t be penalized if their work is scientifically wrong as long as the reasoning is because of their religious beliefs. Reporting on the new bill, Cleveland.com notes: If public school students turn in work saying the earth is only 10,000 years old, they cannot be penalized under Ohio House Bill 164 if its their religious beliefs. House Bill 164, known as the Ohio Student Religious Liberties Act of 2019, entails the following: Requires public schools to give students the same access to facilities if they want to meet for religious expression as they’d give secular groups. Removes a provision that allows school districts to limit religious expression to lunch periods or other non-instructional times. Allows students to engage in religious expression before, during and after school hours to the same extent as a student in secular activities or expression. Prohibits schools from restricting a student from engaging in religious expression in completion of homework, artwork and other assignments. In short, the proposed Ohio law would allow students to substitute religious dogma for science, and would not allow teachers to penalize students for giving wrong answers as long as those answers are based on the student’s religious beliefs.

8ff5d763,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic. Some coronavirus victims could be temporarily buried in the Hart Island potter’s field — or even public parks — if New York’s morgues become overwhelmed by the number of dead, officials said Monday. They floated the heart-wrenching option as the city death toll climbed to 2,738 and the caseload hit 68,776 — accounting for more than half of the Empire State’s 4,758 fatalities and 130,689 cases. “We may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio in a press briefing at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. “Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island.” Located in the Long Island Sound off The Bronx’s southeast coast, the desolate spit of land is the nation’s largest public burial ground, with a macabre history. It has hosted a Civil War prison camp, a colony for tuberculosis patients, and became the resting place for thousands of HIV/AIDS victims during the 1980s who were abandoned by families or unable to receive proper burials. De Blasio — who has been loath to publicly discuss how New York would handle the overwhelming body count — faced the ghastly reality after City Councilman Mark Levine raised an even more dire possibility. “Soon we’ll start ‘temporary interment.’ This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right),” the Manhattan Democrat tweeted prior to de Blasio’s remarks. “Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. “It will be done in a dignified, orderly — and temporary — manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.” Levine, chair of the council’s Health Committee, clarified in a later tweet that the plan to convert parks into makeshift cemeteries was a “contingency,” and City Hall said it wasn’t happening — for now. “We are NOT currently planning to use local parks as burial grounds,” tweeted mayoral rep Freddi Goldstein. “We are exploring using Hart Island for temporary burials, if the need grows.” As New Yorkers were still dying by the hundreds, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday again voiced guarded optimism that the wave may be cresting. After a record 630 deaths were logged Saturday, the number fell to 594 Sunday, and stayed “effectively flat” with 599 on Monday. “The flattening — possible flattening — of the curve is better than the increases that we have seen,” said Cuomo in his daily Albany press briefing. Longtime Cuomo aide Dr. Jim Malatras agreed that New York may be turning a corner. “This could suggest that we are indeed, potentially, at the apex,” said Malatras, while cautioning that this is far from over. “It looks like we are towards the earlier side of the projection.” If the disease is truly hitting its apex, it comes just in time for New York’s overtaxed hospitals. “This is a hospital system where we have our foot to the floor,” Cuomo said. “The engine is at redline, and you can’t go any faster. You can’t stay at redline for any period of time, because the system will blow.” To ease the pressure, President Trump on Monday granted Cuomo’s request for the hospital ship docked along Manhattan’s West Side — the USNS Comfort — to take on COVID-19 patients. The 1,000-bed vessel was originally reserved for non-coronavirus patients, but hadn’t seen many cases in the shut-down city. “That is a welcome relief,” Cuomo told MSNBC of the move.

a3910250,"Self-harm and violent attacks have hit record levels in prisons across England and Wales for the second time in a year, despite repeated warnings that jails are at crisis point and in desperate need of reform. More than 46,850 self-harm incidents were recorded in the year to March 2018, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, with self-harm now recorded on average 128 times a day. Violent incidents meanwhile rose to 31,025, up 16 per cent, and of which 9,003 were assaults on staff – a figure that has soared by more than a quarter 26 per cent in the 12 months to March. It comes after the prison watchdog proclaimed that inmates in England and Wales were enduring some of the “most disturbing conditions ever seen” as authorities fail to take action to curb soaring levels of violence and self-harm. Peter Clarke said “repeated patterns of failure” had led to a point where staff had be inured to conditions that have “no place in an advanced nation in the 21st century”. The data shows that self-harm incidents requiring hospital attendance increased by 12 per cent to 3,095, meaning on average nine inmates a day require hospital treatment after harming themselves. Women were increasingly more likely to self-harm, with 2,244 incidents recorded per 1,000 female inmates - an increase of 24 per cent - compared with 467 incidents per 1,000 in male establishments, marking a rise of 14 per cent from the previous year.

Read our privacy notice The figures show that 310 people died in prison custody in the 12 months to the end of June 2018, including 77 people who lost their lives through suicide. There were 3,926 serious assaults in the year to March, up 9 per cent, and there were five apparent homicides, up from two incidents in the previous year. The 26 per cent rise in assaults on staff will fuel existing concerns over staff retention rates after The independent revealed that the number of prison officers resigning had more than doubled in the last two years. Separate figures published by the Ministry of Justice show that 15 prisons have been given the worst possible score in the department's annual prison performance ratings. The shadow justice secretary said the figures marked a “new low point in this government's mismanagement of our prisons system”. Richard Burgon continued: “Despite all the rhetoric from the Government that it is finally getting a grip of the prisons emergency, we now have an assault every 20 minutes in our prisons and the number of prisons labelled as being of ‘serious concern’ is at its highest in years. “The blame for this prisons emergency lies squarely with the Conservative's decision to axe thousands of prison officers and slash the prisons budget. “If the government is serious about tackling this crisis then it needs to outline an emergency plan and new funds to make our prisons safe.” Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, meanwhile said: “With incidents of self-injury happening every 11 minutes, with assaults occurring every 17 minutes and with six people dying in prison every week, the government must act boldly and decisively to prevent more bloodshed behind bars. “Reducing the number of people in prison would save lives, protect staff and prevent more people being swept into deeper currents of crime, violence and despair.” Deborah Coles, director of INQUEST said the only way to improve safety and reduce prison deaths was to dramatically cut the prison population and invest in community alternatives. She highlighted that the number of deaths awaiting classification over the period had more than doubled, with the majority of people found unresponsive in their cells. The undetermined nature of these deaths raises questions as to whether they are drug related or due to undiagnosed or untreated health conditions, she said. Findings from inquests continue to expose neglect and inadequate health and mental health care as contributing to avoidable and premature deaths. The criminal justice system cannot deal with societal problems of mental and physical ill heath, drug misuse and poverty.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 13 April 2021 The core of the Milky Way becomes visible in the early hours of Tuesday morning as it moves over Bamburgh Lighthouse at stag Rock in Northumberland PA UK news in pictures 12 April 2021 Rebecca Richardson left and Genevieve Florence, members of the Aquabatix synchronised swimming team, during a practice session in the swimming pool at Clissold Leisure Centre in north London, which has reopened to the public.

0192a5cc,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot. The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response. The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action. Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote: Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians. The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson: Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”? Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.” How did this happen? Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances. There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement. Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement. This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.” Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.” Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.” When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them. This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown. Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth. The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it. Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country. Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike. Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.",Rand Paul: We Must Demilitarize the Police,TRUE

The research, which included people in NI, also found that one in four adults who look after children have eaten less so they can feed the children in their household. Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting... Researchers found that half of all adults have tried to cope during the pandemic by purchasing less expensive food which they would not ordinarily choose to buy. Nearly one in three adults who are the least ‘food secure’, and who are looking after children, have also resorted more frequently to eating less so that their children can eat. Kevin Higgins of Advice NI said: “I certainly see these figures as valid for Northern Ireland and this justifies the Covid measures put in place to support people during lockdown.” His organisation, which gives benefits advice, has given extensive support to the vulnerable under lockdown, he said; their NI Covid-19 Community Helpline (0808-802-0020) has answered 18,000 calls since March 27, of which 69% were food related. Mr Higgins also said that some 150,000 food boxes have been distributed across NI under lockdown and that Universal Credit claims in NI have risen from 70,000 to 134,000. “Moving forward I think there needs to be a review of the social security system to ensure it is fit for purpose and provides an adequate income,” he added. Recent improvements to Universal Credit need to be maintained beyond the Covid crisis, he said, and the independent advice sector must be supported to assist people as we emerge from lockdown. Prof Greta Defeyter, director of Northumbria University’s Healthy Living Lab, said: “These findings present an appalling picture of the high percentage of adults experiencing food insecurity in the UK. “If we, as a country, are to stand a chance of getting to grips with this problem, we need the prime minister to oversee and implement with urgency a national food strategy which enhances the supply, affordability, and accessibility of nutritious food to everyone in our country.” This must minimise the need to deploy the many coping strategies, such as the use of food banks, which were identified through the survey, she added. Andrew Forsey, director of Feeding Britain, said: “This survey reveals the lengths to which millions of people in our country are going to keep themselves and their families fed during the pandemic.” The charity is recommending the creation of a jobs programme to prevent long-term unemployment and a review of deductions from Universal Credit and the suspension of the related two-child limit. It is also calling for year-round ‘seamless’ school lunches and breakfasts for children, and tougher employment protections for people in low-paid and precarious work. • FactcheckNI response to this article: Article which claimed that one person in four in Northern Ireland is at risk of hunger was unsubstantiated A message from the Editor: Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Alistair Bushe","Adam Castillejo is still free of the virus more than 30 months after stopping anti-retroviral therapy. He was not cured by the HIV drugs, however, but by a stem-cell treatment he received for a cancer he also had, the Lancet HIV journal reports. The donors of those stem cells have an uncommon gene that gives them, and now Mr Castillejo, protection against HIV. In 2011, Timothy Brown, the ""Berlin Patient"" became the first person reported as cured of HIV, three and half years after having similar treatment. Stem-cell transplants appear to stop the virus being able to replicate inside the body by replacing the patient's own immune cells with donor ones that resist HIV infection. Adam Castillejo - the now 40-year-old ""London Patient"" who has decided to go public with his identity - has no detectable active HIV infection in his blood, semen or tissues, his doctors say. It is now a year after they first announced he was clear of the virus and he still remains free of HIV. Lead researcher Prof Ravindra Kumar Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, told BBC News: ""This represents HIV cure with almost certainty. ""We have now had two and a half years with anti-retroviral-free remission. ""Our findings show that the success of stem-cell transplantation as a cure for HIV, first reported nine years ago in the Berlin Patient, can be replicated."" But it will not be a treatment for the millions of people around the world living with HIV. The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patients' cancers, not their HIV. And current HIV drugs remain very effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives. Prof Gupta said: ""It is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies. ""Therefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful anti-retroviral treatment."" But it might offer hope of finding a cure, in the future, using gene therapy. How does it work? CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body it normally infects. Researchers say it may be possible to use gene therapy to target the CCR5 receptor in people with HIV. It is the same receptor the now jailed Chinese scientist He Jiankui worked on when he created the world's first gene-edited babies. Is it a permanent cure? The tests suggest 99% of Mr Castillejo's immune cells have been replaced by donor ones. But he still has remnants of the virus in his body, as does Mr Brown. And it is impossible to say with absolute certainty his HIV will never come back. Mr Castillejo told the New York Times: ""This is a unique position to be in, a unique and very humbling position. ""I want to be an ambassador of hope. ""I don't want people to think, 'Oh, you've been chosen.' ""No, it just happened. ""I was in the right place, probably at the right time, when it happened."" Prof Sharon Lewin, from the University of Melbourne, Australia, said: ""Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London Patient truly cured? ""The additional data provided in this follow-up case report is certainly encouraging but unfortunately, in the end, only time will tell.""",other
645808de,"Rainsy’s conviction a ‘legal matter, not a political one’ A picture taken outside of Cambodia of Sam Rainsy C,L and the seven other former CNRP lawmakers convicted over the coup plot. A picture taken outside of Cambodia of Sam Rainsy C,L and the seven other former CNRP lawmakers convicted over the coup plot. Facebook Government officials have defended the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s conviction of former opposition leader Sam Rainsy and eight other senior officials over a plot to topple the government amid criticism over the move. Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin said yesterday that the court’s decision against former opposition leaders was made according to the law, saying the court had enough arguments to prosecute them. “More importantly, the authorities have acted in accordance with legal procedures, and the courts conducted the trial based on procedure and made decisions based on the facts and existing legal aspects,” he said. Presiding Judge Duch Sok Sarin on Monday sentenced Rainsy, who is living in exile, to 25 years in jail, while Mu Sochua and Eng Chhai Eang, both vice-presidents and former lawmakers of the ex-CNRP, were sentenced to 22 years in jail each. The judge also sentenced six other ex-CNRP lawmakers to 20 years in jail each after they were found guilty of attempting to “attack” the government. They are Rainsy’s wife Tioulong Saumura, Ou Chanrith, Ho Vann, Long Ry, Men Thavarin and Nuth Romduol. All of them are living in exile abroad. The convicts were deprived of their right to vote and the right to stand for election. Rainsy vowed to return to the Kingdom to restore democracy and human rights on November 9, 2019, but his planned return failed to materialise. However, the government accused him and his allies of planning a coup. In his statement on the conviction, Rainsy said it was simply a “political statement” born out of weakness and fear. “Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is afraid of any risk of my returning to the Cambodian political scene. He also dreads the prospect of any free and fair election which would inevitably lead to the end of his current autocratic and anachronistic regime,” he said. Rainsy claimed Mr Hun Sen has repeatedly refused to allow him and other leading figures of the ex-CNRP to return to Cambodia, saying the sentence is simply intended to intimidate ex-CNRP supporters within the country. However, Malin said ex-CNRP leaders have never acknowledged their wrongdoing. “It is normal for them to never admit their mistakes. As a justification, the perpetrator never admits that he has committed a crime,” Malin added. In its statement, the court-dissolved CNRP described the verdict as: “Cambodia’s politicised court confirms the coup and abolition of democracy”. It said it fully denies all charges and resolutely rejects the verdict. It added that 130 members of the ex-CNRP have been kept in pre-trial detention over the past year and charged as accomplices of the nine CNRP leaders. “The international community must respond to these intolerable developments in an equally determined way,” it added. “These sentences have to be denounced, rejected and ultimately withdrawn.” The US Embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday said it was troubled by the sentences handed down against the nine Cambodian political opposition leaders, including some who are also American citizens. “These sentences are part of a series of mass trials against more than 130 political opposition supporters and civil society activists, which lack basic due process,” it said. “We urge the government of Cambodia to protect freedoms of expression and association, as enshrined in the country’s constitution, and call on authorities to take meaningful steps to reopen civic and political space in the lead up to the 2022 Commune Election and the 2023 National Election,” it added. However, Cambodian People’s Party spokesman Sok Eysan said yesterday that the conviction will result in ex-CNRP leaders no longer being able to enter and participate in the 2022 and 2023 Commune and National Elections. He said the political life of the ex-CNRP leaders has come to an end because of their bad intentions against the people and nation. “The case is a legal matter, not a political one.”",Why Scientists DisagreeAbout Global Warming The NIPCC Reporton Scientific Consensus,FALSE

How? Because agricultural productivity would go up. Several thousand ppm in greenhouses Happer: “if you look around the world, many greenhouse operators put several thousand parts per million into their greenhouses. Host: “Would there be any negative effects on humans from breathing a trhousand parts per million? Happer: “No, absolutely not.” Our primate ancestors were here roughly 70 to 80 million years ago when CO2 levels were 3,000 parts per million. That’s when we evolved. “So it was ten times what it is now.” Happer: “We also let our sailors in submarines live in atmospheres that are several thousand parts per million.” Glacier Bay glaciers disappeared long before any increase in CO2 Happer (6:20 in): “The glaciers in Alaska’s Glacier Bay are all gone. They disappeared in the 1800s.” Happer: “In fact, that was one of the most famous trips of John Muir.

8a9e86f3,"Regulation promotes self-sufficiency and immigrant success WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a final rule that clearly defines long-standing law to better ensure that aliens seeking to enter and remain in the United States — either temporarily or permanently — are self-sufficient and rely on their own capabilities and the resources of family members, sponsors, and private organizations rather than on public resources. This final rule amends DHS regulations by prescribing how DHS will determine whether an alien is inadmissible to the United States based on his or her likelihood of becoming a public charge at any time in the future, as set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The final rule addresses U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) authority to permit an alien to submit a public charge bond in the context of adjustment of status applications. The rule also makes nonimmigrant aliens who have received certain public benefits above a specific threshold generally ineligible for extension of stay and change of status. “For over a century, the public charge ground of inadmissibility has been part of our nation’s immigration laws. President Trump has delivered on his promise to the American people to enforce long-standing immigration law by defining the public charge inadmissibility ground that has been on the books for years,” said USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli. “Throughout our history, self-sufficiency has been a core tenet of the American dream. Self-reliance, industriousness, and perseverance laid the foundation of our nation and have defined generations of hardworking immigrants seeking opportunity in the United States ever since. Through the enforcement of the public charge inadmissibility law, we will promote these long-standing ideals and immigrant success.” DHS has revised the definition of “public charge” to incorporate consideration of more kinds of public benefits received, which the Department believes will better ensure that applicants subject to the public charge inadmissibility ground are self-sufficient. The rule defines the term “public charge” to mean an individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months, in the aggregate, within any 36-month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months). The rule further defines the term “public benefit” to include any cash benefits for income maintenance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), most forms of Medicaid, and certain housing programs. The regulation also excludes from the public benefits definition: public benefits received by individuals who are serving in active duty or in the Ready Reserve component of the U.S. armed forces, and their spouses and children; public benefits received by certain international adoptees and children acquiring U.S. citizenship; Medicaid for aliens under 21 and pregnant women; Medicaid for school-based services (including services provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act); and Medicaid benefits for emergency medical services. This rule also makes certain nonimmigrant aliens in the United States who have received designated public benefits above the designated threshold ineligible for change of status and extension of stay if they received the benefits after obtaining the nonimmigrant status they seek to extend or from which they seek to change. Importantly, this regulation does not apply to humanitarian-based immigration programs for refugees, asylees, Special Immigrant Juveniles (SIJs), certain trafficking victims (T nonimmigrants), victims of qualifying criminal activity (U nonimmigrants), or victims of domestic violence (VAWA self-petitioners), among others. This rule also explains how USCIS will exercise its discretionary authority, in limited circumstances, to offer an alien inadmissible only on the public charge ground the opportunity to post a public charge bond. The final rule sets the minimum bond amount at $8,100; the actual bond amount will be dependent on the individual’s circumstances. This final rule supersedes the 1999 Interim Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds and goes into effect at 12:00 a.m. Eastern on Oct. 15, 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register. USCIS will apply the public charge inadmissibility final rule only to applications and petitions postmarked (or, if applicable, submitted electronically) on or after the effective date. Applications and petitions already pending with USCIS on the effective date of the rule (postmarked and accepted by USCIS) will be adjudicated based on the 1999 Interim Guidance. USCIS will provide information and additional details to the public as part of public outreach related to the implementation of this rule. In the coming weeks, USCIS will conduct engagement sessions for the public and other interested groups to ensure the public understands which benefits are included in the public charge inadmissibility rule and which are not.

1.73E+23,"1 year ago A report by the Transparency International (TI) has said Ghana has been rated as the second most corrupt country in Africa, followed by Nigeria, with South Africa perceived as the most corrupt nation on the continent. The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) by the TI stated that about 71 per cent of people living in Ghana said corruption had increased over the last 12 months. The report revealed how people on the continent perceived their countries as far as corruption was concerned and what their leaders were doing to minimise that. It noted that corruption was so endemic that all the respondents wished their leaders acted swiftly to end the canker. Most governments across Africa were also seen as failing in their duty to stop the abuse of power, bribery and secret deals, according to the new opinion poll. The majority (58 per cent) of Africans in the surveyed countries said corruption had increased over the past 12 months. In 18 out of the 28 countries surveyed, a large majority of people said their governments were doing badly at fighting the canker. The report added that the police were regularly rated as highly corrupt, but the strong negative assessment of business executives was new, compared to previous surveys.","A recent study in the journal Cancer Discovery found that inhalation of harmful microbes can contribute to advanced stage lung cancer in adults. Long-term use of face masks may help breed these dangerous pathogens. Microbiologists agree that frequent mask wearing creates a moist environment in which microbes are allowed to grow and proliferate before entering the lungs. Those foreign microbes then travel down the trachea and into two tubes called the bronchi until they reach small air sacks covered in blood vessels called alveoli. ""The lungs were long thought to be sterile, but we now know that oral commensals–microbes normally found in the mouth–frequently enter the lungs due to unconscious aspirations.” – Leopoldo Segal, Study Author and Director of the Lung Microbiome Program and Associate Professor of Medicine at New York University Grossman School of Medicine According to the study, after invading the lungs these microbes cause an inflammatory response in proteins known as cytokine IL-17. “Given the known impact of IL-17 and inflammation on lung cancer, we were interested in determining if the enrichment of oral commensals in the lungs could drive an IL-17-type inflammation and influence lung cancer progression and prognosis,” said Segal. While analyzing lung microbes of 83 untreated adults with lung cancer, the research team discovered that colonies of Veillonella, Prevotella, and Streptococcus bacteria, which may be cultivated through prolonged mask wearing, are all found in larger quantities in patients with advanced stage lung cancer than in earlier stages. The presence of these bacterial cultures is also associated with a lower chance of survival and increased tumor growth regardless of the stage. Additionally, research into the cultivation of Veillonella bacteria in the lungs of mice found that the presence of such bacteria leads to the emergence of immune suppressing cells as well as inflammatory ones such as cytokine IL-17. “Given the results of our study, it is possible that changes to the lung microbiome could be used as a biomarker to predict prognosis or to stratify patients for treatment.” – Leopoldo Segal As more evidence emerges pertaining to the long-term effects of mask mandates and lock downs, doctors and scientists are beginning to reconsider whether these authoritarian measures really are doing more harm than good. One Canadian public health expert named Dr. Aji Joffe found in a related study that lock downs cause “at least ten times” more damage than benefit. In a recent working paper by researchers at Harvard, Duke, and John Hopkins Universities, academics concluded that “for the overall population, the increase in the death rate following the COVID-19 pandemic implies a staggering 0.89 and 1.37 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively.” Since forced mask wearing began, dermatologists have coined the term ‘maskne’ to describe an onset of pimples near the mouth caused by masks clogging up pores with oil and bacteria. This can be caused by either disposable or cloth masks. Dentists have also been warning about a phenomenon known as ‘mask mouth’ in which patients are arriving back to the dental office with an increase in gingivitis and tooth decay as high as 50% in a period of just a few months since mask mandates began. This discovery sheds light on the growing evidence of harm caused by long-term mask wearing",FALSE

25aa97f1,"Many Democrats are crowing that the 82nd Legislature will go down as one in which, despite the ""emergency"" push for sanctuary cities legislation, nothing emerged from the Capitol that waill substantially alter the way immigration laws are enforced. Yet Republicans did manage to eke out one small victory during the special session, successfully attaching language to Senate Bill 1, the must-pass fiscal matters bill, that would require people applying for driver's licenses or other state-issued identification cards to prove they're in the country legally. Such a policy, as opposed to a law on the books, had been in effect since 2008, when the Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring applicants for driver’s licenses and ID cards to produce government-issued documents that affirmed their legal status. Before 2008, according to DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange, such proof was not required to obtain a license or ID. Immigrants' rights groups were irate over the policy change, which they alleged could have the effect of denying legal residents access to those forms of ID, with DPS clerks acting as de facto immigration agents. In 2009, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund sued DPS, arguing that the agency overstepped its authority by implementing the policy even though the Legislature rejected similar legislation in the 2007 session. Last month, however, House Appropriations Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, took matters into his own hands. Pitts cribbed language requiring applicants for driver's licenses and ID cards to prove their legal residency from Senate Bill 9, an omnibus homeland security bill filed by state Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, and added it as an amendment to SB 1. The amendment also allows the DPS to determine expiration dates for those IDs based on when an immigration document was issued. For a non-citizen or non-permanent legal resident, DPS can issue a document that “expires on the earlier of a date specified by DPS or the expiration date of the applicant's authorized stay in the United States.” If the immigration document does not have an expiration date, DPS can issue an ID or license that expires every year. During the just-concluded regular and special sessions, Williams argued that Texas was only one of three states that didn’t have a policy regarding legal status for ID applicants and said one was necessary to ensure that foreign criminals were not receiving IDs. He noted that, as part of an appropriation of $64 million over the next biennium for temporary visitors stations, DPS staff will be trained to identify and approve the dozens of immigration documents currently used to apply for driver's licenses and IDs. People attempting to renew their exisiting licenses or IDs but don't have immediate access to passports or birth certificates could also be impacted by the new law, Mange said. The Pitts amendment requires that they provide DPS with proof of residency or citizenship as well. Mange said the agency ""may have"" something in its files indicating that an applicant has previously produced such proof, but if it was before 2008, she said, ""you may want to bring something just in case."" Mange said that Texans should receive a notice from DPS when it's time to renew that will inform them whether they're eligible to renew online, which can only happen if they didn't renew online the previous time. ""We require everyone to come in once every 12 years so we can see your smiling face,"" she said. The Legislature’s actions could signal an end to the 2009 court case. Still, MALDEF attorney Luis Figueroa questions the timing of the Pitts amenemnt, which coincides with the passage of a new Voter ID law requiring citizens to show a valid state-issued ID before casting a ballot. Democrats and advocacy groups, including MALDEF, rallied against the Voter ID measure during the session, claiming it would decrease turnout at a time when Texas already ranks near the bottom of all states in ballot-box participation. During the Voter ID debate, Democrats charged the law would make it difficult, in particular, for senior citizens who haven't had a picture ID in years to vote. “If [voters] are trying at the last minute to get a driver’s license and trying to get the documents they need and they are rejected, it’s going to make the process slower,” Figueroa said. Aides to both Pitts and state Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, who worked with the Senate to attach the amendment to SB 1, said they were unaware of those concerns. They noted a majority of Senate Democrats voted for SB 9 during the regular session, when it contained the driver's license/ID provision. But Geren expressed some displeasure this week that the driver’s license language made it on to the fiscal matters bill while “sanctuary cities” language — which would prohibit local entities from adopting policies that prevent the enforcement of state and federal immigration laws — did not. Failure to pass a sanctuary cities bill, which Gov. Rick Perry declared an emergency item during the regular session and added to the special-session call, resulted a round of finger-pointing by the House and Senate. The House, which approved a bill in the regular session, blamed the Senate for not following suit. The Senate, which passed a bill in the special session, blamed the House for failing even to move it out of committee in the special. Perry then blamed state Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock who chaired the SB 1 conference committee, for refusing to add sanctuary cities to the committee's report. “They were several interviews [in which] some of the senators said that SB9 did not belong in SB1,” an animated Geren said. “Well, they sure as hell wanted this part of SB9 in SB1.”",Kremlin: German Clinic's Diagnosis of Navalny's Condition Doesn't Show He Was Definitely Poisoned,partially false
8e967b1f,"Trump seeks to ban transgender people from serving in U.S. military 'in any capacity' Show Caption Hide Caption Trump says military will no longer accept transgender troops President Donald Trump said he will reverse former President Obama's policy that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military. USA TODAY WASHINGTON — President Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. military will not accept transgender troops into its ranks or allow them to serve in any capacity, reversing a policy that began under the Obama administration – and triggering intense criticism from lawmakers and civil libertarians. In a series of morning tweets, Trump said that, after consulting ""with my generals and military experts,"" the U.S. government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military."" The U.S. military, he said, ""must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" Trump's decision was made Tuesday, and he informed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis later in the day, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday. The policy allowing transgender troops to serve was ""expensive and disruptive"" and affected military readiness, she said. Democrats disagreed. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, called Trump's announcement ""an unwarranted and disgraceful attack on men and women who have been bravely serving their country."" Related: It’s unclear how Trump's tweets will affect the estimated 6,000 transgender troops who are already in the military. Under the policy announced in July 2016, those troops were allowed to serve openly. Prior to that, the military discharged them for medical reasons. It's also uncertain whether a series of tweets constitute a presidential directive, and whether Trump must sign documents to make the new policy effective. After the tweets, the Pentagon issued a statement saying only that it would work with the White House ""to address the new guidance"" provided by the president. Brad Carson, the former chief of Pentagon personnel issues and an architect of the policy, said Trump's sudden announcement appeared to catch the Pentagon ""flat-footed,"" and he predicted the renewed ban will be challenged in court. ""This will be devastating to those service members, but it will also hurt national security, as we have transgender people in many mission-critical occupations,"" Carson told USA TODAY. Joshua Block, a lead attorney on the issue with the ACLU, said the group most certainly will mount a legal challenge. But he noted that Pentagon regulations allowing transgender troops to serve openly remain in effect. ""Even the president can't eliminate regulations by tweet,"" Block said. Senate Dems hit health vote, transgender ban Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut expressed criticism of Republicans who were still trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Others railed against President Donald Trump's move to ban transgender people from the military. (July 26) AP The method of Trump's notice by Twitter also drew ire. Noting that Trump's statements are unclear, and that the Pentagon is already complying with parts of the Obama transgender policy, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the sudden news ""is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter."" McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also noted that many transgender troops are serving honorably and that anybody who meets medical and readiness standards should be allowed in the military. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, issued a brief, pointed statement criticizing Trump's announcement, saying discrimination in any form is wrong and that he needs clarity from the military about what the tweeted policy means. ""Transgender people are people, and deserve the best we can do for them,"" Hatch said. Meanwhile, former Obama administration officials, prominent Democrats and civil rights advocates condemned Trump's announcement. Ashton Carter, who instituted the policy that would allow transgender troops to serve as President Obama's defense secretary, said the only thing that matters in choosing service members is that they are qualified. ""There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably,"" Carter said. ""This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service."" Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted that ""every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop."" In a tweet of her own, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told Trump that ""this fight is not over,"" and ""hatred will never defeat #pride."" The advocacy organization GLAAD called it ""another example of the Trump administration attempting to make LGBTQ people invisible."" And some Democrats used the opportunity to slam Trump's own lack of military service. In its statement, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called the president a ""draft dodger."" Some Republicans also criticized the policy reversal. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted that ""no American, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be prohibited from honor + privilege of serving our nation #LGBT."" Many Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, had criticized the transgender policy, and applauded Trump's move. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., said on Twitter that she was pleased to see that Trump ""shares my readiness and cost concerns,"" and ""will be changing this costly and damaging policy."" The issue, she said, comes down to military readiness. She sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that was narrowly defeated on July 13 that would have prohibited funding medical treatment for transgender troops. However, the Pentagon commissioned a report last year by the non-partisan RAND Corp. on transgender troops that found medical treatment would cost no more than $8 million per year and have a negligible impact on the military’s readiness to fight. Under Trump and Mattis, the Pentagon delayed implementation of a key portion of the Obama administration's plan: requiring the services to begin accepting and recruiting new officers and enlisted troops. The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps requested more time to implement the policy, saying they needed time to study the effects of accepting transgender troops. The Army has compulsory sensitivity training for soldiers and civilian employees. Some members of Congress have also tried to limit spending on transgender troops in this year’s legislation authorizing military spending. What does it mean to identify as LGBT? Here is a guide to understanding LGBT terms. Sara Snyder, USA TODAY On Tuesday, in a statement to USA TODAY, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen urged the acceptance of transgender troops by the military, saying that previous policies that prevented gay and lesbian troops from serving damaged the military. During his six months in office, Trump has reversed a number of Obama policies, from environmental regulations to U.S. membership in the Paris climate change agreement. The transgender announcement is the latest example, and it's a decision that is likely to have political implications. Trump sought the support of LGBT voters during last year's election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In tweet sent in June of 2016, he told the LGBT community that ""I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs."" Yet social conservatives applauded the decision. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said that, ""as our nation faces serious national security threats, our troops shouldn’t be forced to endure hours of transgender ‘sensitivity’ classes and politically-correct distractions like this one."" Republican consultant Liz Mair, a Trump critic, said the decision could help him politically with socially conservative voters. ""Even though this decision is totally cynical and was not made properly and is dubious on its merits, Trump could look semi-reasonable, given the response and existing perceptions."" With Trump struggling in public opinion polls, Mair said the decision ""won't improve his approval rating but might actually help stop some bleeding.""

The Italian state police said on Monday that it had seized a cache of Nazi memorabilia and weapons – including a missile – from a neo-Nazi gang in northern Italy. The operation, the police said, was a result of a year-long investigation into far-right political movements who had fought “against the separatists” in Ukraine's eastern breakaway region of Donbass. Despite the rather unambiguous wording of the police statement, a host of mainstream media outlets got it dramatically wrong, essentially reporting the exact opposite. Also on rt.com Italian police seize MISSILE, guns and neo-Nazi material in raid on far-right militants Citing either the police or unspecified “Italian media,” outlets including Reuters, CNN, the Guardian, BBC and CBS reported that the group “had fought alongside Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine” CNN, Reuters, “took part in the Russian-backed insurgency” The Guardian, or that the raid was carried out “as part of an investigation into Italian far-right help for Russian-backed separatists” BBC. While the original statement leaves little room for error, several Italian outlets did rephrase it to sound less precise, describing the neo-Nazis as having taken part in the Ukrainian conflict. The police statement is worded in a similar way. It is possible that multiple people jumped to the same wrong conclusion, or that an initial mis-translation got picked up by a crowd of media outlets known for their anti-Russian bias, who proceeded to skip fact-checking in favor of a narrative that reinforces it. Either way the strategy seems to be bearing fruit, as only a few commentators on social media have taken issue with the false report. Italian media make sense: these nazis were on Ukrainean nazis side against Russian supported rebels.

90d7df46,"COVID-19 has left many struggling to pay rent, but Asheville resident Rachel Atkins is facing a different housing challenge: She was told she had to pay a full 12-month lease in advance because of her job in the service industry. Atkins, who works at a downtown restaurant, has been trying to find a house and move in with her partner. They found a property at 74 Livingston St. and scheduled a viewing on June 22. The house was perfect, and within an hour, they had submitted an application with WNC Property Management, which oversees the rental. The next morning, Atkins received the following email from WNC Property Management: “Since your employment is in the service industry, and many businesses in the service industry are currently struggling, closed or potentially closing in the near future, you would be required to prepay your 12-month lease in advance.” Atkins offered to send previous pay stubs and a letter from her employers verifying her job. But that wasn’t good enough. “[W]e are in very challenging and uncertain economic times, and there is a good chance that many businesses in the service industry will be closing over the next 12 months,” a response from the property managers read. BACK AND FORTH: Atkins received the following email message from WNC Property Management after submitting an application for a house at 74 Livingston St. Screen capture courtesy of Rachel Atkins The bill for the entire 12-month lease added up to $14,400, Atkins said. After the property manager said it couldn’t compromise, she posted the exchange to Facebook, prompting hundreds of comments in several locally oriented Facebook groups. “I just feel stressed out about finding a spot to move in,” Atkins said. “It’s already a tricky market without adding in all these layers.” Jim Barrett, executive director of Asheville-based nonprofit Pisgah Legal Services, says that requiring a year’s rent in advance is likely legal. However, he continues, the requirement may run counter to “the spirit of the residential security deposit law.” “This practice probably does not violate the Fair Housing laws because working in a particular job is not a protected class, ordinarily,” Barrett said. “Landlords can discriminate based on credit checks, so I guess landlords can require a prospective tenant to demonstrate ability to pay.” WNC Property Management posted a statement to its Facebook page, saying “rent prepayment is not our company policy across the board for the service industry, as many have jumped to the conclusion. “For this particular property, a [previous] tenant lost their job and was unable to pay rent, and the homeowner is requiring our company to ask all future tenants, where 100% of household income comes from a service industry job, to prepay their rent,” the statement continued. “We are contractually obligated to follow our client’s instructions. “We stand with all those that work in Asheville’s service industry and realize that they are the fabric of our city and regret that our initial response did not reflect this. As a small, locally owned business that has been hit as well, we empathize with anyone that has been affected by these challenging economic times. We have had to shut down the vacation rental management part of our business and have suffered large financial losses as a result.” After receiving multiple comments on that statement, the management group released a subsequent message, which read: “The property in question has been removed from the market as the owner understands some were having trouble meeting a prepaid lease agreement. They understand the difficult time that many are going through right now and in no way wanted to add to anyone’s difficulties. They are now weighing options moving forward, and in the meantime, we have chosen not to relist the property unless it can be offered with no prepaid requirement.” Atkins doubts she will apply for the house in question after her experience but says she is happy other people may now be able to qualify for a home.",Restaurant employee challenges property group on prepaid lease,TRUE
073f3552,"EXCLUSIVE: Third of cases won by terrorists, murderers and lags EXCLUSIVE by TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor 17th August 2015, 11:01 pm Updated: 5th April 2016, 8:00 pm A THIRD of those who have won against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights are terrorists, prisoners or criminals, figures show. Among claimants the court found in favour of since 1975 are murderers, terrorists in Iraq and IRA gunmen. Its recent controversial judgments include refusing a Home Office deportation order for Islamic hate preacher Abu Qatada and insisting prisoners must have the vote. The figures showing that the 297 victories against the UK included 94 prisoners, terrorists or criminals are revealed in a glossy dossier produced by ECHR-supporting pressure group RightsInfo. It is a response to criticisms of the Strasbourg court by Tory ministers and The Sun. Commons Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill MP said: “This is well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights. “It’s mission creep, law made by judges who are not judges and many from countries with questionable human rights and very little judicial experience. “Political pressure groups take advantage of that naivety, which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums.” It costs £286million a year to fund the euro judges’ governing body, the Council of Europe and £23million of that comes from British taxes.

RightsInfo’s Adam Wagner said: “People accused of crimes or convicted of offences have human rights too, so it isn’t surprising that they have featured in 40 years of cases.” The fanatic Hate preacher Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada won the right to stay in Britain rather than be deported to his homeland Jordan after ECHR judges said there was a risk evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in a terror trial. In that case Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, would not get a fair trial. The Strasbourg court’s 2012 decision overturned a ruling by UK law lords. Qatada had been convicted in Jordan in 1999 in his absence of a conspiracy to carry out bombings. He was finally returned in 2013 after Jordan agreed torture evidence would not be used. PRISONER John Hirst first won the right for convicted criminals to vote following a European court ruling in 2005. Hirst had previously lost his claim at the High Court in 2001 but took the case to Europe and won. No UK Government has legislated on the issue despite four rulings in Hirst’s favour by the Strasbourg-based court. Hirst who served 25 years for the unprovoked manslaughter of his landlady, said: “You don’t lose your status in civil society just because you’re in prison — you are still a member of the public.” The IRA men Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 TEN IRA men killed by soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary had their human rights violated, the ECHR ruled in 2001. Its judges said the authorities failed to conduct proper inquiries into the deaths. The UK Government was ordered to pay each of the IRA men’s families £10,000. Tory and Ulster Unionist MPs said the ruling was a disgrace and an insult to those who tried to keep the peace. Unionist Ken Maginnis said: “It now seems common practice as far as the European Courts are concerned to pander to militant Irish republicanism.”",European Court of Killers’ Rights,other
93f075bb,"It’s been more than a year since Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst lost his bid to become a U.S. senator, but his campaign still owes consultants and vendors nearly $1 million, Federal Election Commission records show. In a July filing, the Dewhurst For Texas federal campaign committee disclosed various “debts and obligations” owed to consultants and other service providers, including top Republican consultants Dave Carney, Mike Baselice and Jim Bognet. The unpaid bills range from several six-figure debts to media experts to a few hundred dollars owed to a company that provided email services. The total tab: $909,875.90, records indicate. Many of the vendors are upset about getting stiffed for thousands of dollars from the campaign of a multi-millionaire candidate like Dewhurst, who hasn’t hesitated to pour some of his vast wealthy into his political endeavors. In a written statement, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed to the alleged embezzlement by former campaign manager Kenneth “Buddy” Barfield. Lawyers for Dewhurst's state and federal campaign committees have accused Barfield of stealing as much as $2 million from both his state and federal campaign coffers. According to news reports, both state and federal authorities are investigating the allegations, and Dewhurst’s two campaigns have filed a civil lawsuit to recover the funds. Barfield’s lawyer, Brian Casey, declined comment. “The Dewhurst state and federal committees have filed suit in Travis County district court and are vigorously pursuing recovery of all funds embezzled by Kenneth Barfield, including those that should have been used to pay any outstanding federal campaign obligations,” Considine told The Texas Tribune on Tuesday. That explanation didn’t soothe several of the vendors. Jeff Roe, owner of Missouri-based Candidate Command, which prepares and sends out direct mail advertisements, said he incurred postage and printing costs based on assurances from Dewhurst that he would be compensated for his services. Figures show Roe's company is still owed $134,343. “This is not some consultant fees, this is expended resources spent in the pursuit of election victory,” Roe said. “It’s clear he’s able to raise resources and pay these debts. The steps we took were on David’s word that we would be paid. That wasn’t some Buddy Barfield promise. That was David. It was based on David’s honor.” At least two of the consultants carrying the year-old debt have continued to work for Dewhurst, who is now engaged in a highly competitive race to keep his powerful job as lieutenant governor, which oversees proceedings in the Texas Senate. They are fundraiser Becca McMullen, owed $50,000 for a “fundraising consulting bonus,” and Ryan Gravatt, whose Internet services company, Raconteur Media, is owed $45,362 for website consulting and advertising, records show. “I’m working for David Dewhurst because I personally like him. He has integrity,” Gravatt said. “I’ve been told that this will be made right and I’ll be made whole, and I’m still hopeful that that will be the case.” McMullen was not available for comment, Considine said. A law firm providing legal services and a firm providing accounting services were the only creditors to whom the Dewhurst Senate campaign made any payments during the last reporting period, the report shows. The Dewhurst campaign previously refunded about $800,000 in contributions to donors who had given him money for a general election that never came, officials said. Dewhurst lost the GOP primary to Ted Cruz, now the state's junior U.S. senator. Here are some of the debts the Dewhurst Senate campaign still owes, according to the FEC: $170,628 to OnMessage, a media consulting and polling firm. The company, in which former Dewhurst consultant Brad Todd is a partner, also did work for Gov. Rick Perry ’s 2012 presidential campaign. $125,000 to Something Else Strategies, a national media consulting firm that does work for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and others. $112,885 to former general consultant and strategist Jim Bognet, a former top campaign aide to Mitt Romney. $50,452 to Baselice & Associates. Mike Baselice, who has provided polling data to Perry and other Texas Republicans, was Dewhurst's pollster during the Senate race. $36,388 to Norway Hill, Carney’s consulting company. A longtime consultant to Perry, Carney is now a top consultant for Attorney General Greg Abbott , the frontrunner in the race to succeed Perry. $20,000 to John Doner & Associates, a well-known research firm based in Austin. The debts on the campaign reports for the top vendors reflect partial non-payment. All of them were paid previously for services rendered earlier in the campaign, records show. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, for example, OnMessage is listed as the recipient of some $7 million and Bognet is shown as having received $278,000. It’s not clear whether the billings listed on the website include any of the outstanding debts recorded in the July FEC report. Roe, who owns the direct mail company in Missouri, said even though it’s been a year, he remains optimistic that Dewhurst, who spent most of his life in the business world, will step in and settle the debts. “I continue to be hopeful that this will be resolved,"" he said.","""A spokesman for the Soros company, Paid Liberal Trolls of America, says the men and women who signed up were told up-front that they should obey the law and not go to jail: “They were paid for 6 hours at $30 per hour, plus a meal stipend of $40 per day. Add to that a very generous 70 cents per mile for travel and a big cookie, and these people were given neary $1K to be there. All they had to do was go home before curfew. They chose to stay, so they can pay their own bail.” Soros has a bad habit of not paying bail for his protesters, citing case after case of people not showing up for court. “If they don’t show up. we don’t get those funds back, and we can’t write them off as a business expense,” said Attorney Joe Barron, “They should know better than to expect someone as kind as George Soros to just toss an extra $500 per person out the window.” Some protesters might be satisfied with that answer, but most are not. According to their leader, Art Tubolls, the 163 people filing the suit will show at the Soros mansion in Deluth if they have to: “We’re not afraid to protest for real. Charlie Kirk and Turning Point said they’ll fund that endeavor, even if it means he has to bail us out. That guy’s giant head is filled with kindness.”""",TRUE

0631e9ad,"Spread the love UPDATE: Politifact has called this article false, claiming police told them that the man “voluntarily surrendered his weapons.” That information was not available at the time this article was written, nor was it cited in the original piece by the Sun-Sentinel. The Free Thought Project explained the reasoning behind our original article in an interview with Politifact. Below is that exchange: Hi Allison, thanks for reaching out. In both of the cases mentioned below, neither of the two men were suspected of committing a crime, nor had they committed a crime. Under the fifth and fourteenth amendments, due process clauses are in place to act as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law. What’s more, neither of the men were granted their sixth amendment rights to be confronted with the witnesses against them. In both cases, simple orders—under new laws—were issued, arguably arbitrarily, which stripped these two men of their property. As I explained in the article. These men had their guns confiscated based on the accusations of others, only. When a person is stripped of their constitutional rights, albeit temporarily, without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations, this is the removal of due process. This is why I gave examples of how these red flag laws can be abused by both law enforcement, spouses, or any group of people who wants to ruin a person’s life by making up threatening stories about others. In Florida, the man could’ve been baker acted, prior to having his guns taken, and then deemed a threat to himself or others by a psychologist. This is not a perfect system, but at least it has a semblance of due process. Regardless of the court issuing an order, no crime had been committed and law enforcement was acting on hearsay only. Hopefully you see the danger in such measures and why we feel it necessary to point them out. No one wants dangerous mentally ill people to have access to weapons, but no one wants gun grabs in the middle of the night from innocent people who have only been accused of acting strangely either. When someone is accused of being a threat, bring that person in, question them, evaluate them, then decide whether or not he needs to have his guns removed. This is what due process looks like, not the other way around. Hope that clears it up. In the original questioning by Politifact, TFTP was asked why we thought the “confiscation” removed a man’s due process. Politifact referred to this as a confiscation which is why we replied with the above information. However, only after this interview did Politifact reveal previously unpublished information about the man “voluntarily” surrendering his arms. At no time did TFTP ever set out to intentionally deceive or mislead people as the case in point is described above. However, given this new information, we have changed the title of this piece and updated it to reflect the new information. Below is the original article. Broward, FL — In what’s being called the first gun confiscation of its kind in Florida, police have taken four guns and a couple hundred rounds of ammunition from a 56-year-old Lighthouse Point man. The man was not tried, had not committed a crime, and the guns were solely removed because “experts” deemed him a threat. The guns and ammunition have been temporarily removed from the man under the state’s new “risk protection” law, which is also sometimes called “red flag” legislation, Lighthouse Point City Attorney Michael Cirullo confirmed, according to the Sun-Sentinal. “We know it’s the first case of its kind in Broward County and we think it’s the first one in Florida, under the new law,” Cirullo said. “Up until the introduction of this law last week, there was no process for us to protect the public in this kind of situation.” In Florida, prior to passing the new gun control law, people deemed psychologically unfit could be involuntarily hospitalized under what is called the Baker Act. During this involuntary admission to a hospital, the person is evaluated to determine if they are a risk to themselves or others. Only after they had been psychologically evaluated and deemed a threat could the government then move in to temporarily disarm them. Now, however, this tiny bit of due process is no longer necessary and “experts” can simply deem someone a threat and issue an order take their guns. If they do not comply with this order, only then will a warrant be issued. Although the 56-year-old man was subsequently Baker Act-ed, he was told to surrender his guns before this happened. To illustrate the insidious nature of Florida’s new bill and its rights-violating implications, prior to the new legislation, if police would have done what they did to this 56-year-old man—taken his guns with no due process—they would be fired and fined up to $5,000. It is important to note that this man was certainly acting strangely and, according to the Sun-Sentinal, he told officers he “was being targeted and burglarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a neighbor who lives in (his) building,” the judge wrote in his order. “(He) could not describe the neighbor but stated that the neighbor ‘shape shift, he can change heights and I’m not sure where he comes from’ and ‘to be honest, he looks like Osama Bin Laden.'” He also turned off all of his power to the apartment he lived in. By all means, he was acting very strangely. It will now be up to the man to prove that he is healthy enough to ever be able to get his guns back again. To be clear, no one here is advocating for people determined to be mentally unfit to be able to possess firearms. However, they need to be determined to be mentally unfit before they lose their rights. This law was a reaction to the shooting in Parkland, however, it is important to point out that there were already laws on the books that should’ve stopped Nikolas Cruz from ever getting a gun. Citing Cruz as the reason for advocating the removal of due process, the anti-gun activists are claiming he should’ve had his guns taken which would have prevented the tragedy. Sadly, however, they are ignoring the fact that he was accused of multiple felonies—and should’ve never been able to purchase a gun in the first place—but law enforcement failed to act on any of it. In Florida, if a person making death threats intends for the victim to fear for her safety, specifically fearful of death or bodily harm, it is considered a credible threat under the law, which changes the crime from stalking, a first-degree misdemeanor, to aggravated stalking, a felony of the third degree. Cruz was reported at least 4 times for this very crime before he bought his AR-15 and police did nothing. Florida’s law also mirrors another due process-removing law that was recently used in Washington state to remove a man’s guns. As TFTP reported earlier this month, there is a law on the books known as the Extreme Risk Protection Order or ERPO, which went into effect in June of 2017. This law is used when a person is considered an “extreme” threat as reported by police and family members. An ERPO must be approved by a judge and only after this person is proven to be a danger to themselves or others can police move in to confiscate their weapons. “We now have to go to someone’s house and knock on the door and say, ‘We’re from the government. Can we have your guns?’” Seattle police Sgt. Eric Pisconski told KIRO Radio’s Dave Ross. “That can get very dangerous.” While touted as a necessary tool for police, an ERPO and Florida’s new law both remove due process as the person who is accused of being mentally unstable does not have to be present and gets no chance of facing their accuser. To those who may be in favor of such laws, consider the following: There is no way to stop an estranged spouse from call police repeatedly and telling them their ex is threatening to cause harm to others. While the man in Florida had his guns taken for being psychologically unfit, the man in Seattle simply open-carried a pistol and looked out of windows and his guns were taken because his neighbors thought it was strange. Anyone, any time, now has the ability to claim someone else is a threat and have police take their guns. One does not need to delve into the multiple ‘what if’ scenarios to see what sort of ominous implications arise from such a practice. What’s more, police now have the power to deem you a threat at any time and legally disarm you—due process be damned. This is the exact scenario that Donald Trump advocated for in February. Last month, notorious gun-grabber Senator Dianne Feinstein, sat next to Donald Trump and likely salivated over his remarks as he called for the removal of due process and to “take the guns first.” Now, police are doing just that. To those that support these laws under the ostensible notion that it would make you safer, you would do well to remember history before you or someone you know finds yourself subject to these very laws.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) said the downward trend had been most pronounced among British workers. Many leavers cited working conditions. But the government said there were now 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals in England than in 2010. In April and May this year, there was a more dramatic fall in those leaving nursing and midwifery, with a further 3,264 workers going. Other than retirement, the main reasons given for leaving were working conditions - including staffing levels and workload - personal circumstances and disillusion with quality of care to patients, according to an NMC survey of more than 4,500 leavers. Other reasons included leaving the UK and poor pay and benefits. Saffron Cordery, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: ""These figures provide further evidence of the severe workforce problems NHS trusts face. ""This goes beyond the concerns over Brexit - worrying though they are. ""The reduction in numbers is most pronounced among UK registrants.

a5e0c051,"Milwaukee emerged as America's fourth-most impoverished big city in 2009, as the Great Recession rippled across the city and state, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures released Tuesday. Milwaukee's poverty rate reached 27%, up from 23.4% in the previous year. Only Detroit (36.4%), Cleveland (35%) and Buffalo (28.8%) had higher poverty rates among cities with populations greater than 250,000. Milwaukee was ranked 11th in 2008. An estimated 158,245 Milwaukeeans lived in poverty last year. For a family of four with two adults and two children, the poverty threshold was an annual income of $21,954. What's more, nearly 4 in 10 children in Milwaukee were considered poor, meaning an estimated 62,432 children lived in poverty last year, up from 49,952 in 2008. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat who is running for governor, said the poverty numbers ""are unacceptable and should be of concern to everyone in the community and the state."" ""They obviously are in part a result of the global economic downturn which has disproportionately affected lower incomes,"" he said. ""But it has also sent lower middle-class people into poverty as well. It explains why we're looking so aggressive to create more jobs, tackle the issues of education, workforce development and transportation."" Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, the Republican candidate for governor, said the ""anti-business"" policies of Democrats Barrett and sitting governor Jim Doyle have directly affected ""the poverty levels in Milwaukee and cities across our state."" ""As governor, I'll work to get government out of the way so we can help struggling families and bring 250,000 jobs to Wisconsin,"" Walker said in a statement. Barrett disputed Walker's assertion and said, ""I have never seen any signs that he is interested in addressing the poverty issues in our community, period."" He said that jobs provide the best remedy for alleviating poverty and added that he would prefer the issue not be politicized. ""I wish this is one (issue) we could reach across the aisle and work together,"" Barrett said. Michael Bonds, president of the Milwaukee School Board, said he was not surprised by the newest poverty figures. ""I think we're at a critical point when we're starting to see some of the broader things in the community impacting students,"" he said. ""Not only do schools have to deal with traditional education, but now they also have to provide supports that were traditionally provided by other agencies, because those institutions are also facing financial challenges,"" he added. Bonds said he doesn't see any quick-fix to bring children out of poverty in Milwaukee. ""Some areas of the city, you see African-American unemployment reaching 60% to 70%,"" he said. Marc Levine, executive director of the Center for Economic Development at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said the latest census data reflect the city's lack of job growth. ""Our analysis of employment data shows that Milwaukee has had among the worst job creation records of any big city in the U.S. for over a decade, so it is not surprising that poverty numbers have worsened, especially during the worst recession since the Great Depression,"" Levine said. Hard times didn't hit just in Milwaukee. Real median household income in the state declined between 2008 and 2009 - decreasing by 3.8% from $51,942 to $49,993. Poverty also surged statewide from 10.4% to 12.4% in 2009. There were an estimated 570,583 people in poverty in the state in 2008 and 683,408 people in poverty in 2009. Nationally, poverty increased from 38.3 million people in 2008 to 42.8 million in 2009. Ken Taylor, executive director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, labeled the poverty numbers as ""brutal"" and said they ""confirm our worst fears about the reality of the recession on kids."" ""The idea that what happens in Milwaukee doesn't influence Ozaukee County is a fallacy,"" he said. ""We're all affected across the state by the challenges in Milwaukee."" In the suburbs outside Milwaukee, the poverty rates were much lower, led by Waukesha County (4.8%) while Ozaukee (5.3%) and Washington (5.4%) counties were not much higher. The poverty rates in those counties all increased at least 1 percentage point. The results come from the American Community Survey, which provides a snapshot of the nation's socioeconomic, housing and demographic characteristics. Later this year, the Census Bureau will release the first results from the 2010 Census, the complete count of every person in the country.

65dd63fc,"Voters line up for the first day of early voting outside of the High Museum polling station in Atlanta, Georgia on Dec. 14, 2020. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) Trump Won Two-Thirds of Election Lawsuits Where Merits Considered The claim often repeated by the mainstream media, social-media content moderators, and fact-checkers that lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump’s campaign and Republicans were universally dismissed by the courts is untrue, according to a new analysis. The findings do not necessarily suggest that if the lawsuits had all been decided before Joe Biden was certified as the official winner of the presidential election by Congress on Jan. 7 that former President Trump would have won the hotly contested election. Nor would they necessarily have affected many of the Electoral College votes won by Biden in the disputed battleground states. Some of the legal victories took place in states like Colorado and Iowa where the popular vote counts for the respective winners of those states –Biden in Colorado and Trump in Iowa— were not close. Of the 22 cases that have been heard by the courts and decided on their merits, Trump and Republicans have prevailed in 15, according to citizen journalist John Droz Jr., a physicist and environmental advocate in Morehead City, N.C. This means Trump has won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts. Droz and a team of volunteers dug through court filings and legal minutiae to track down 81 lawsuits that were filed in connection with the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election. The lawsuits were tracked on Droz’s publicly available spreadsheet that was current as of Feb. 6. Of the 81 cases, 11 were withdrawn or consolidated and 23 were dismissed for lack of standing or on other grounds. Both the cohort of 11 and of 23 should not be considered “wins or losses for either side,” Droz says, because they “have nothing to do with the merits of the case.” This leaves 47 cases. Of those 47, 22 have been finalized after the court heard arguments, considered evidence, and then issued a ruling. Of those 22, Trump or Republicans won 15 and lost 7, according to the analysis. This leaves 25 lawsuits that have yet to be finally disposed of. This means Trump and Republicans “have WON the majority of 2020 election cases fully heard, and then decided on the merits!” Droz said in a statement. “Is that what the mainstream media is reporting?” Among the legal victories for Republicans were: RNC v. Miller, in the Iowa courts, a lawsuit in which the Republican National Committee won an injunction over absentee ballot applications. RNC v. Gill, in the Iowa courts, in which the Trump campaign won an injunction preventing a county official from distributing and accepting signed forms containing preprinted information. Trump for President v. Boockvar, in the Pennsylvania courts, in which the Trump campaign was granted an injunction against the counting of mail-in and absentee ballots where voters were allowed to provide proof of identity days after Election Day. Droz noted that only three lawsuits addressed voting machine inaccuracies. “One of these was dismissed (due to jurisdiction), one was ruled against (although no discovery was granted), and one is still open (discovery was granted).” “The likely explanation for so few cases in these two areas is that legally proving fraud or voting machine manipulations are very time-consuming processes, that require substantial investigative work and documentation. There simply wasn’t enough time to do this prior to key points in the process (like the Electoral College).” “Our view is that the public needs to be much better educated regarding the election integrity issue—and having a more accurate understanding of the lawsuit component is a key part of that,” Droz wrote, explaining the purpose of his report.",Carbon dioxide hits a level not seen for 3 million years.

a655530c,"DATE: November 1, 2015 TO: USF & NRA Members and Friends FROM: Marion P. Hammer USF Executive Director NRA Past President Many folks remember that during the fight to pass Florida's Concealed Carry law, the Florida Sheriffs Association opposed concealed carry. They literally said they didn't like ""hidden guns."" At the time, open carry was legal in Florida and had been for decades. They said if people were going to be allowed to carry guns, they needed to carry them openly so law enforcement officers could see them and know who had guns -- they claimed it was a matter of officer safety. Now, they have reversed positions. They claim concealed carry is fine and they don't mind concealed guns. BUT, open carry is dangerous. They claim they won't know the good guys from the bad guys, and one sheriff (now retired) said law enforcement would have to ""draw down"" and anybody carrying openly. You've probably heard or read most of the rhetoric. They always lead off saying they are strong Second Amendment supporters then proceed to explain why they OPPOSE Second Amendment rights. The Constitution guarantees your right to keep and bear arms and it certainly doesn't say you can only exercise your rights if your sheriff agrees with it. Below are the facts about open carry -- it is a rebuttal of some the latest claims. You may also click here The Truth About Open Carry to download a copy for the fact sheet to share with others. The Truth About The Open Carry Bill & the 45 States that Allow Open Carry In recent Palm Beach Post Blog articles and a Tampa Bay Times Blog article, the Chairman of the Florida Sheriffs Association's Legislative Committee (FSA) is quoted with some erroneous claims regarding the proposed open carry bill in Florida (SB-300 by Sen. Don Gaetz and HB-163 by Rep. Matt Gaetz). In recent Palm Beach Post Blog articles and a Tampa Bay Times Blog article, the Chairman of the Florida Sheriffs Association's Legislative Committee (FSA) is quoted with some erroneous claims regarding the proposed open carry bill in Florida (SB-300 by Sen. Don Gaetz and HB-163 by Rep. Matt Gaetz). Below are some of those claims and our responses. FSA CLAIM: ""The bill as currently drafted is extremely broad, lacking limits on when, how or where firearms could be carried."" FACT: The same provisions and restrictions that apply to concealed carry also apply to open carry (s.790.06). Only a person with a license to carry concealed will be able to carry openly. Additionally, the improper exhibition of firearms law (s.790.10) applies whether carrying concealed or openly. Further, because of these and other erroneous claims, a clarification amendment, to stop open carry opponents from continuing to make such false claims, was added to the bill in Senate Criminal Justice Committee the morning of 10/20/15 – We know the spokesman made that claim even AFTER the clarification amendment was added because the spokesman made reference to an amendment ""that didn't pass"" in the same committee meeting. Since the FSA spokesman obviously doesn't want to believe the NRA's data, the following data was provided by Florida Carry, Inc. – and their data confirms ours. FSA CLAIM: ""The bill's proponents claim that 45 other states already allow open-carry. But that's not really accurate."" FACT: To the contrary, it is accurate. Forty-five (45) states allow open carry of firearms. Varying restrictions on open carry in some states does not alter the fact that 45 states allow open carry. 15 of 45 open carry states require a license to carry concealed or openly. 30 of 45 open carry states do not require any license to carry openly 0 of 15 of the concealed carry license states require additional training to carry openly 0 of 45 states offer a separate ""open carry"" license 2 of 45 states require an open carry holster. On 1/1/16 Texas will require a holster. 0 of 45 states require a retention holster. 5 of 15 are ""may-issue"" states where law enforcement issues licenses 15 of 15 states require the license holder to produce the license on lawful demand by a law enforcement officer. FSA CLAIM: ""... most open-carry states have strict rules about ... producing the permit on demand."" FACT: This is a red herring. FLORIDA law already requires license holders to produce a license on demand by a law enforcement officer. And for the record, all 15 states that require a license, require producing the license on lawful demand by a law enforcement officer. FSA CLAIM: ""...[I]t's ‘intellectually dishonest' to say open carry laws are working in the 45 other states because there are so many variations in the laws and the demographics. FACT: The open carry laws are working in 45 states. Opponents have presented no evidence to the contrary – no evidence that it isn't working in any state and no evidence of problems in any state. These are just baseless allegations. Simply because different states have variations in their laws does not in any way alter the fact that open carry is allowed and that it’s working. FSA CLAIM: ""In Pennsylvania, for example, cities can opt out of its open carry law and some, including Philadelphia, do just that, Gualtieri said. Florida cities don't have the option to opt out of a state law."" FACT: Pennsylvania DOES NOT allow cities to opt out of its open carry law. Pennsylvania does not require a license for a person to carry openly. Philadelphia cannot ""opt out"" of the state open carry law. Pennsylvania state law allows the city of Philadelphia (and only Philadelphia) to require a license to carry openly in Philadelphia. FSA CLAIM: As for demographics, ""You can't compare Sioux Falls, S.D. to downtown Miami or downtown Tampa or downtown Orlando,"" Gualtieri said. FACT: This argument is illogical and perhaps intentionally misleading. Seventy percent (70%) of the American public live in open carry states from all regions of the country. Many of the 45 open carry states have large and diverse cities just like Florida and where you live geographically, whether it's Trilby, FL or Fanning Springs, FL, you have the same constitutional rights as citizens who live in Miami, Tampa, or Orlando. FSA CLAIM: ""...the state's trespass law gives businesses the right to ask anyone openly carrying a weapon to leave their property,"" but they ...

f211e09f,"OUR sun has gone into lockdown, which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, scientists say. The sun is currently in a period of “solar minimum”, meaning activity on its surface has fallen dramatically. The sun is currently in a period of decreased activity on earth. Experts believe we are about to enter the deepest period of sunshine “recession” ever recorded as sunspots have virtually disappeared. Astronomer Dr Tony Phillips said: “Solar Minimum is under way, and it’s a deep one. “Sunspot counts suggest it is one of the deepest of the past century. The sun’s magnetic field has become weak, allowing extra cosmic rays into the solar system. “Excess cosmic rays pose a health hazard to astronauts and polar air travellers, affect the electro-chemistry of Earth’s upper atmosphere, and may help trigger lightning.” Nasa scientists fear it could be a repeat of the Dalton Minimum, which happened between 1790 and 1830 — leading to periods of brutal cold, crop loss, famine and powerful volcanic eruptions. Temperatures plummeted by up to 2C over 20 years, devastating the world’s food production. On April 10, 1815, the second largest volcanic eruption in 2,000 years happened at Mount Tambora in Indonesia, killing at least 71,000 people. It also led to the so-called Year Without a Summer in 1816 — also nicknamed “eighteen hundred and froze to death” — when there was snow in July. So far this year the sun has been “blank” with no sunspots 76 per cent of the time, a rate surpassed only once before in the Space Age — last year, when it was 77 per cent blank.",Illinois General Assembly,FALSE
3a0ddacc,"Last year was warmer by 0.04 Celsius, but it was also an El Niño year. By now you’ve seen the headline: 2016 was the hottest year on record. The news has been paired with predictions of civilization’s imminent demise. But a closer look at the evidence reveals that the political heat is overwrought—and there’s still no reason to re-engineer the global economy to mitigate small climate fluctuations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced this week that last year was the warmest in the agency’s 137-year series, and that 2016 broke the previous record for the third consecutive year. This sounds alarming, until you read that 2016 edged out 2015 by a mere 0.04 degrees Celsius. That’s a fraction of the margin of error. Atmospheric data from satellites detected similarly small warming over previous years. In other words, no one really knows if last year was a record. Here’s what we do know: 2015 and 2016 were major years for El Niño, a Pacific trade winds phenomenon known to produce temperature spikes. The Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels has detailed in these pages how in 1998, another big El Niño year, average surface temperatures increased about a quarter-degree Fahrenheit and then dropped in the following years. That is similar to the increase in 2015—and by the end of 2016 temperatures were falling back toward 2014 levels. Even NOAA admits El Niño’s role. The underreported news here is that the warming is not nearly as great as the climate-change computer models have predicted. As climatologist Judith Curry testified to Congress in 2014, U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change simulations forecast surface temperatures to increase on average 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade in the early 21st century. The warming over the first 15 years was closer to 0.05 degrees Celsius. The models also can’t explain why more than 40% of the temperature increase since 1900 happened between 1910 and 1945, which accounts for only 10% of the increase in carbon emissions. These nuances are important because phrases such as “hottest year ever” are waved around as a pretext for political action that usually involves giving more control over the economy to governments. This is inevitably sold as urgently required to save the planet.",Keeping Cool About Hot Temperatures,other

Comments: (319) 398-8238; kat.russell@thegazette.com Robert Noye","A small team of Israeli scientists think they might have found the first complete cure for cancer. “We believe we will offer in a year’s time a complete cure for cancer,” said Dan Aridor, of a new treatment being developed by his company, Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies Ltd. (AEBi), which was founded in 2000 in the ITEK incubator. AEBi developed the SoAP platform, which provides functional leads to very difficult targets. “Our cancer cure will be effective from day one, will last a duration of a few weeks and will have no or minimal side-effects at a much lower cost than most other treatments on the market,” Aridor said. “Our solution will be both generic and personal.” Dr. Ilan Moran (Courtesy)Dr. Ilan Moran (Courtesy) It sounds fantastical, especially considering that an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide each year, according to reports by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Further, every sixth death in the world is due to cancer, making it the second leading cause of death (second only to cardiovascular disease). Aridor, chairman of the board of AEBi and CEO Dr. Ilan Morad, say their treatment, which they call MuTaTo (multi-target toxin) is essentially on the scale of a cancer antibiotic – a disruption technology of the highest order. The potentially game-changing anti-cancer drug is based on SoAP technology, which belongs to the phage display group of technologies. It involves the introduction of DNA coding for a protein, such as an antibody, into a bacteriophage – a virus that infects bacteria. That protein is then displayed on the surface of the phage. Researchers can use these protein-displaying phages to screen for interactions with other proteins, DNA sequences and small molecules. In 2018, a team of scientists won the Nobel Prize for their work on phage display in the directed evolution of new proteins – in particular, for the production of antibody therapeutics. AEBi is doing something similar but with peptides, compounds of two or more amino acids linked in a chain. According to Morad, peptides have several advantages over antibodies, including that they are smaller, cheaper, and easier to produce and regulate. When the company first started, Morad said, “We were doing what everyone else was doing, trying to discover individual novel peptides for specific cancers.” But shortly thereafter, Morad and his colleague, Dr. Hanan Itzhaki, decided they wanted to do something bigger. To get started, Morad said they had to identify why other cancer-killing drugs and treatments don’t work or eventually fail. Then, they found a way to counter that effect. For starters, most anti-cancer drugs attack a specific target on or in the cancer cell, he explained. Inhibiting the target usually affects a physiological pathway that promotes cancer. Mutations in the targets – or downstream in their physiological pathways – could make the targets not relevant to the cancer nature of the cell, and hence the drug attacking it is rendered ineffective. In contrast, MuTaTo is using a combination of several cancer-targeting peptides for each cancer cell at the same time, combined with a strong peptide toxin that would kill cancer cells specifically. By using at least three targeting peptides on the same structure with a strong toxin, Morad said, “we made sure that the treatment will not be affected by mutations; cancer cells can mutate in such a way that targeted receptors are dropped by the cancer.” “The probability of having multiple mutations that would modify all targeted receptors simultaneously decreases dramatically with the number of targets used,” Morad continued. “Instead of attacking receptors one at a time, we attack receptors three at a time – not even cancer can mutate three receptors at the same time.” Furthermore, many cancer cells activate detoxification mechanisms when in stress from drugs. The cells pump out the drugs or modify them to be non-functional. But Morad said detoxification takes time. When the toxin is strong, it has a high probability of killing the cancer cell before detoxification occurs, which is what he is banking on. Many cytotoxic anticancer treatments aim at fast-growing cells. But cancer stem cells are not fast growing, and they can escape these treatments. Then, when the treatment is over, they can generate cancer again. “If it does not completely annihilate the cancer, the remaining cells can start to get mutations again, and then the cancer comes back, but this time it is drug resistant,” Morad said. He explained that because cancer cells are born out of mutations that occur in cancer stem cells, most of the overexpressed proteins which are targeted on the cancer cell exist in the cancer stem cells. MuTaTo’s multiple-target attack ensures that they will be destroyed as well. Finally, some cancer tumors erect shields which create access problems to large molecules, such as antibodies. MuTaTo acts like an octopus or a piece of spaghetti and can sneak into places where other large molecules cannot reach. Morad said the peptide parts of MuTaTo are very small (12 amino acids long) and lack a rigid structure. “This should make the whole molecule non-immunogenic in most cases and would enable repeated administration of the drug,” he said. Morad said their discovery could also reduce the sickening side-effects of most cancer treatments, which stem from drug treatments interacting with the wrong or additional targets, or the correct targets but on non-cancerous cells. He said MuTaTo’s having a combination of several highly specific cancer-targeting peptides on one scaffold for each type of cancer cell would increase the specificity to the cancer cell due to the avidity effect. In addition, in most cases, the non-cancer cells that have a protein in common with the cancer cells do not overexpress it. “This makes a great difference between the two kinds of cells and should decrease the side effects dramatically,” Morad said. He equated the concept of MuTaTo to the triple drug cocktail that has helped change AIDS from being an automatic death sentence to a chronic – but often manageable – disease. Today, AIDS patients take protease inhibitors in combination with two other drugs called reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The drug combination disrupts HIV at different stages in its replication, restrains an enzyme crucial to an early stage of HIV duplication and holds back another enzyme that functions near the end of the HIV replication process. “We used to give AIDS patients several drugs, but we would administer them one at a time,” Morad explained. “During the course of treatment, the virus mutated, and the AIDS started attacking again. Only when patients started using a cocktail, were they able to stop the disease.” Now, he said, people with AIDS are HIV carriers, but they are not sick anymore. The MuTaTo cancer treatment will eventually be personalized. Each patient will provide a piece of his biopsy to the lab, which would then analyze it to know which receptors are overexpressed. The individual would then be administered exactly the molecule cocktail needed to cure his disease. However, unlike in the case of AIDS, where patients must take the cocktail throughout their lives, in the case of MuTaTo, the cells would be killed, and the patient could likely stop treatment after only a few weeks. The company is now writing patents on specific peptides, which will be a large bank of targeting toxin peptides wholly owned and hard to break, said Aridor. Morad said that so far, the company has concluded its first exploratory mice experiment, which inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect at all on healthy mice cells, in addition to several in-vitro trials. AEBi is on the cusp of beginning a round of clinical trials which could be completed within a few years and would make the treatment available in specific cases.",TRUE
136d378a,"Unvaccinated Children Pose No Risk To Anyone, Says Harvard Immunologist","One of the strengths–and weaknesses–of a Western medical education is its predisposition to break things down and compartmentalize them. While much data is gleaned in the minutiae, very little attention is given to the interrelationship between disciplines. While a medical student may become a true specialist in their field, they too become compartmentalized, and are often ignorant of very important information that would be essential for a broader, more holistic overview. And this appears to be by design.  advertisement - learn more A case in point is the testimony of Tetyana Obukhanych, who earned her Ph.D. in Immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York and did post-graduate work at Harvard. In a presentation she delivered in British Columbia (full video here), she was discussing scientific evidence from a publication dealing with a measles outbreak in Quebec in 2011. The evidence showed that 48% of those who had contracted measles were fully vaccinated for measles, and this does not even include those who were vaccinated only once for the measles, as they get lumped in with the unvaccinated people. She took a moment to tell a story about how she became aware of this phenomenon: The interesting thing is that my field, the field of immunology, the basic field that sort of is responsible for all these theories of immunity, we don’t really deal with the real world. We do research in labs. We are sort of an ivory tower profession and we don’t even read these publications because this is too far away from our field. We only read what’s specific to our research and usually it’s immunizations and how antibodies are generated and all the details of the immune responses. And I went through my whole PhD training and I believed that vaccines give you immunity and that if you got vaccines there is absolutely no way, virtually no way, that you would get a disease, and I’m pretty sure that most of my colleagues in my narrow field believed the same way, and we had conversations about that. And even someone at some point mentioned to me and said that they had a vaccine and they got measles and I sort of brushed it aside and thought that the person is confused. It was either she didn’t have the vaccine or it wasn’t measles, one of the two. But what happen is that a few years ago I had to apply for American citizenship and part of the procedure is to submit your vaccination records, right, and this was the first time that I looked at my own vaccination records carefully, and I discovered that I had two measles vaccines in my childhood. Well, I didn’t know about it because I was too young to remember, but what I remember really well is that when I was 11 I had measles, and so that was a little bit harder to discount. And I told recently someone else and they said, ‘Oh, you are confused about that, you didn’t have measles!’ like ‘How do you know?’ ‘Did you check <whether> you really had the virus there or not?’ So it’s just, you know, the doctors diagnosis, right? But I lived in Ukraine, and there, you know, there was tons of measles around and doctors knew when they saw measles. But anyway, so the reason I kind of had to look for these papers is to actually to confirm to myself whether I’m confused about my measles or is this a general phenomenon and it’s happening, and it’s documented in the literature. And indeed it is documented in the literature. But immunologists don’t know about it. Let that sink in for a moment. You get your PhD in Immunology, and you leave school to go out into the world to work on things like, oh, immunization, and you haven’t learned that you can still get certain diseases even if you’ve been fully vaccinated against them? Despite this being scientifically documented and an uncontested fact? Again, ignorance by design.",FALSE

64d89844,"COLUMBUS, Ohio - This July, Ohio will begin tracking arsonists through a new registry similar to the one used to track sex offenders. The law, passed by the Ohio General Assembly late last year without much attention, will require people convicted of arson-related offenses to register at their local sheriff's office each year for at least 10 years. Those who fail to register will be charged with a felony. Supporters tout the measure as another tool for law enforcement in investigating the difficult-to-solve crime. But critics argue the registry will be burdensome, and that arson is not a significant enough problem in Ohio to warrant an official registry, especially one that is kept from the public's eyes. ""There is a huge problem with arson in Ohio,"" said Sen. Tim Schaffer, a Lancaster Republican who sponsored the bill. With the registry, law enforcement ""can look up who all the convicted arsonists are, who have done their time and are back at home or back in the community. Chances are good that it's a repeat offender, and you already know who . . . it might be."" Last year, 8,377 ""suspicious"" fires were reported, which resulted in more than $160 million in estimated damages, according to the Ohio State Fire Marshal. There are approximately 500 convictions of arson each year, according to the Buckeye State Sheriff's Association. ""I don't know where it came from,"" Amy Borror, spokeswoman for the Ohio Public Defender's Office, said of the new law. ""I don't know why we have it."" Borror said the law will put unnecessary work on the shoulders of local sheriffs, who will be tasked with compiling the list in addition to the sex-offender registry they already put together. ""The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety,"" Borror said. ""And, if anything, it might have a negative impact on public safety because it creates this administrative burden."" Nick Worner, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union, said a registry for arson seems arbitrary and will do little to solve crimes because ""rounding up the usual suspects"" is rarely an effective investigation method. ""Are we eventually going to have a registry for everything?"" Worner said. ""Will we have a shoplifters registry, where if something comes up missing at JC Penney's, they round up everybody who has ever been convicted of shoplifting and start there? ""Generally, the problem with this sort of thing is that it's supposed to start with the gathering of evidence in the investigation and then the detaining of people based on suspicion. This kind of does that backwards."" Worner also expressed concern that money needed to maintain the registry may end up coming from taxpayers' pockets. He said fees paid by offenders are supposed to finance registries, but that does not necessarily mean they will make the payments. Another big concern, Worner said, is that unlike the sex-offender registry, this one is not publicly available, meaning only law enforcement has access to the list. ""I think we would argue there is an issue with gathering this information in the first place, but it's an important question to ask: If you have to exempt the information from public-records law, should you be gathering it in the first place?"" Worner asked. Borror noted that the sex-offender registry has errors and inconsistencies, and the arsonist list will remain unchecked by the public, leaving many potential problems unaddressed. Schaffer said the list will not be public because arson-related crimes are very different from sex offenses, and he has received no demand to make the list public. ""I haven't had one member of the public ask me for access to this law-enforcement tool,"" Schaffer said. ""It's a law-enforcement tool. It's for the same reason that you can't access the state of Ohio's database for people's license plates. What's the purpose?"" He said providing the registry to the public is not off the table, but Ohioans would have to express a desire to see the list. Robert Cornwell, executive director of the Buckeye State Sheriff's Association, said he was pleased with the new law, which he said should provide new techniques for arson investigators. Cornwell said his organization approves of the registry because police should know the whereabouts of convicted arsonists. He did not estimate a much-larger workload for sheriffs in compiling the registry. Michael Duchesne, spokesman for the State Fire Marshal, also expressed support of the registry, saying it will afford law enforcement more options when investigating arson-related crimes. He said there are enough suspicious fires in Ohio to necessitate the registry. Worner, with the ACLU, said even if the list is a new tool for law enforcement, it will not prove crimes. Ohioans should worry about the precedent the arson registry may create, he said. ""You have to look down the road,"" Worner said.

4a1a9b9f,"Urgent action to boost the number of children and young people receiving life-saving vaccinations will be set out by the Prime Minister today. Boris Johnson will visit a hospital in the South West and lay out a number of measures designed to improve vaccination rates, including for measles, mumps and rubella MMR. While confidence in the UK’s world-leading vaccination programme remains high – with uptake exceeding 90% for most childhood immunisations – there has been a small but steady decline in coverage in recent years. It means that the UK has lost its ‘measles-free’ status with the World Health Organisation WHO – three years after the virus was eliminated in the country. The WHO have stated that in the first six months of 2019 reported measles cases globally are almost three times as many as the same time last year. Measles is now endemic in countries including France, Germany and Italy. The PM has now called for health leaders to renew their efforts to meet 95% for both doses of MMR. Currently just 87% of children are getting their second dose of the jab, which has likely contributed to the spread of measles. Action to achieve this includes: NHS England writing to GPs urging them to promote ‘catch up’ vaccination programmes for MMR for 10-11 year olds, as well as all those 5-25 year olds who have not had two doses of the jab; Strengthening the role of local immunisation coordinators – healthcare professionals that promote vaccines particularly with hard-to-reach families. This includes supporting areas with low uptake and tailoring specific local interventions to under-vaccinated communities; Addressing parents’ concerns about vaccines by updating the advice on NHS.uk specifically to address misleading information about the dangers of vaccines, by giving people NHS-approved, evidence-based and trusted advice on vaccines including through a new website; Calling a summit of social media companies to discuss how they can play their part in promoting accurate information about vaccination; and The Department for Health and Social Care – working with Public Health England and NHS England – delivering a comprehensive strategy to address the issue in the Autumn. Ahead of the hospital visit Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: After a period of progress where we were once able to declare Britain measles free, we’ve now seen hundreds of cases of measles in the UK this year. One case of this horrible disease is too many, and I am determined to step up our efforts to tackle its spread. This is a global challenge and there’s a number of reasons why people don’t get themselves or their children the vaccines they need, but we need decisive action across our health service and society to make sure communities are properly immunised. From reassuring parents about the safety of vaccines, to making sure people are attending follow-up appointments, we can and must do more to halt the spread of infectious, treatable diseases in modern-day Britain. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: It’s easy to forget how devastating measles can be precisely because vaccines are so effective at preventing it in the first place. With this strategy, the whole health system will come together to renew focus on vaccinations – especially for our children – and this time we will eliminate measles for good. The Prime Minister’s visit to the South West is part of a series of visits to hospitals he is taking. He will meet doctors and nurses, hearing directly from them about what support they think the NHS needs so it can continue to be the best healthcare service in the world. Measles elimination status means that the virus is no longer circulating permanently in a country. The UK achieved measles-free status in 2016 after three years of limited spread due to high vaccination rates, but measles has since been spreading slowly in the UK for over 12 months. In the first quarter of 2019, there were 231 confirmed cases of measles in the UK. Many of these were acquired abroad with some onward spread in under-vaccinated communities. The Department for Health’s strategy to be published in the Autumn is also expected to: Ask the NHS to use technology to identify who may have missed a vaccination and make booking appointments easier, such as improved call/recall systems for those accessing immunisations, and more consistent use of these systems across UK healthcare to remind people of their vaccine appointments. As part of the GP contract review, examine wider questions of improving GP capacity to allow additional immunisation appointments – while also asking NHS England to consider other settings outside of a GP for vaccinations. Develop a major campaign with NHS England and Improvement, Public Health England and GP practices to support the importance of key vaccinations in protecting against potentially dangerous diseases. Work with DFE to explore more ways in which students can be informed about their health and wellbeing including the value of vaccinations – plus enabling them to critically assess misinformation spread online about certain vaccines. This comes as part of a wider government drive on Prevention, following the publication of the Prevention Green Paper last month. Head of Immunisation at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay said: Losing our ‘measles-free’ status is a stark reminder of how important it is that every eligible person gets vaccinated. Elimination can only be sustained by maintaining and improving coverage of the MMR vaccine. Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man – only one person travelling back to an area with lower vaccination rates can lead to an outbreak.

Writer at Large Neil Mackay reports The teachers SCOTLAND’S teachers have had enough. Firstly, teachers say, they’ve had enough of Nicola Sturgeon putting her electoral fortunes ahead of education. Secondly, they’ve had enough of being bullied, harassed and attacked by what they see as a highly politicised mob on social media employing Trump-style tactics against them, and demanding schools stay open even in the most dangerous of circumstances. Larry Flanagan, head of Scotland’s largest teaching union the EIS, deals with the Scottish Government every day as the nation’s schools struggle to make it through lockdown. Ask him about Sturgeon’s handling of Covid and schools and he pointedly says: “I think the First Minister is very focused on the election.” Privately, senior Scottish teachers who work with the Government on the pandemic aren’t so diplomatic. “John Swinney [Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary] has his eye firmly fixed on the educational challenges,” one said. “The First Minister has her eye firmly fixed on the election. There’s a tension in Government there.” Flanagan feels that “Nicola Sturgeon and her Government are as focused on the politics of the situation as they are on the educational issues – whereas our focus is entirely educational”. The SNP administration “has an eye on the political optics as much as anything else”. Sturgeon is sensitive to criticism that she’s putting politics before education. Flanagan says he doesn’t understand why “as it’s in their DNA”. Flanagan also feels that “the general message of the Government has been less than empathetic to teachers”. The experience of teachers has been “harrowing, high stress … Most have been living on the edge and torn between the desire to do their best for students but also knowing they’re at risk on a daily basis … A lot feel undervalued, particularly by Government and the political class.” He adds: “It can be a demoralising experience. We’ve said directly to Government … that it’s shown a distant lack of empathy with the challenges that have existed in schools, as if there are no issues to be concerned about. They’ve underplayed teacher concerns.” On the First Minister, Flanagan says: “If you were to analyse most of her comments she rarely says very much about teachers, her focus is on parents and pupils, and that’s legitimate … for her to be concerned about, but I think a lot of teachers feel she’s just dismissive of their concerns.” Although schools are now closed, many teachers feel they had to battle to get this far against a government which wanted to put the wishes of parents before safety. Although teachers obviously worry for themselves and their families, many also felt that keeping schools open endangered pupils, pupils’ families and the wider community. Teachers haven’t forgotten the period before Christmas when they clamoured for school closures as the new Covid variant started to hit but the Government remained intransigent, insisting schools were safe and should remain open. Teachers were horrified that schools remained opened as level four restrictions were introduced. “That’s when the political debate became sharper,” Flanagan said, adding: “All we wanted was at level four, each council should look at the potential for blended or remote learning if it was required.” He references cases such as one Scottish school which “had over 400 pupils off with Covid-related illnesses and self-isolation ... and they still weren’t closing the school … We were saying there’s clearly a huge community outbreak in this area – closing the school makes sense, going to remote learning is a better educational position and it’ll drive down infection levels, but at that point it had become a kind of totem for the Government that they weren’t going to close schools”. Flanagan told Swinney that he thought the Education Secretary was “frightened to close schools in case you get a backlash”. Nor have teachers forgotten that the Government backtracked on plans for blended learning and suddenly switched, opting for a full reopening of schools last summer. “That was just a straight political decision as the FM was concerned at the backlash … the FM realised that having blended learning for a year was unlikely to do her party’s election chances any good so she wanted a different message.” Referencing the past debate around closing schools, Flanagan highlighted what he calls “the sophistry you get from the Scottish Government. They said ‘the risk to teenagers is no greater than to adults’. Well, that’s fine, but there’s quite a high risk to adults. You’re downplaying it by saying ‘it’s not greater than’ … John Swinney kept saying schools were safe environments. I kept saying they’re not … that’s why teachers were getting annoyed as they downplayed the risk.” Claims over the safety benefits of pupils social distancing incense teachers. “It’s not possible,” says Flanagan. No teacher spoken to said it was possible to keep a class of 30 pupils socially distanced. Teachers have also expressed concerns over Government use of data. Flanagan says that in November, data was used to claim schools were safe but statistics covered just the first six weeks of schools being reopened. “There was political sleight of hand to reference a retrospective report as being immediately applicable to the current situation,” he says. The EIS leader, who sits on the Government’s Covid Education Recovery Group, also raised concerns about the circumstances surrounding schools staying open at the end of last year. “At the time we were calling for a ‘firebreak’ while the Government and local authorities were saying ‘no’, but looking back at the data for the period it shows that school infections had reached their highest peak in all age groups since the pandemic started.” Flanagan added: “I think the Government and the First Minister have got a political objective around schools being open. They’d say that’s because, like us, they understand the importance of schools to young people’s wellbeing. We’re not going to disagree on that but I think they also have quite a political agenda. They’re potentially open to attack from other parties if they’re seen to be closing schools – and getting parental backlash.” In comparison to the UK Government, however, Flanagan is clear that “by and large the Scottish Government’s default position is to seek partnership and collaboration”. The EIS is fully involved in discussions about decision-making. In England, teacher groups “struggle just to get dialogue”. The Scottish Government, he stresses, “is not as unreasonable as the UK Government”. Flanagan is conscious of the fact that he has to keep Government onside. “I need to be able to persuade Government to do the right thing,” he says. Many members, however, are keen to strike if pushed too far. “Ultimately, we’re trying to get a reasonable response from Government … it would be failure of the partnership approach if we had to ballot for industrial action.” Sturgeon said this week that schools will remain shut until at least the middle of February. Teachers, though, fear a rush to reopen before its safe. Flanagan points to the new variant’s “transmissability among young people”. There are fears over reopening schools without properly enforced social distancing among pupils. “All that will happen is the R figure will go up,” Flanagan says. In terms of discussions around the future of reopening schools, he adds: “There’s a lot of unknowns and they’re all contingent on the control of the virus and the impact of the vaccine.” The vast majority of teachers want schools open but they want them reopened safely. “Teachers absolutely know that schools being open is the best thing possible for kids, it’s the easiest option for teachers when it comes to learning as remote learning is a huge challenge.” There is a worry among rank-and-file teachers that Government decisions are taken by civil servants and other experts who know little about life inside schools and so lack “empathy”. Flanagan says that when it comes to Covid, there have been “more fights with individual councils than we’ve had with Government”. There are sometimes different approaches taken to schools across different council areas. “Teachers who were shielding before we moved to lockdown, in a number of areas they were allowed to work from home,” Flanagan says. “In Glasgow, they said ‘no, you can’t, teachers are frontline, they have to be in school or off sick’. This was even for people with medical letters. Glasgow said ‘no’ – so Glasgow can be very hardline.” Teachers also worry that their safety comes secondary to the economy and allowing parents to work. “There’s an element around why schools need to open which isn’t about the needs of children, but the needs of the economy,” says Flanagan, though he adds: “I don’t think it’s writ as large in Scotland as it is in England … by and large Scotland has benefited from a more cautious approach to the virus.” Although teachers are sympathetic to parents, there is a limit to sympathy. “Some of the emails I’m getting … about having to support their child with home learning – I do have to temper my replies … They’re your children – the idea that the school should be there to provide childcare is an unwelcome thread.” Flanagan also feels that “the discourse around lost learning has to be challenged. What we have is interrupted learning, nothing is lost or irretrievable. There are kids every year who miss a whole year because they’re ill and you wouldn’t say about those kids ‘that’s it, you’ve missed your chance’. It’s nihilistic. To say your future is gone is just rubbish. Politicians fall into this trap far too easily.” Teachers are critical of Government failure to prepare for this new lockdown when it comes to remote learning and “digital inequality” – the lack of computers, and wi-fi, for poor children. The EIS says not enough equipment has been distributed. “In Glasgow, some iPads issued have protocols which don’t allow kids to access videos.” Flanagan urged the Government to follow a cautious approach to reopening schools. “The key issue now is, with potentially only a few months to go until the vaccine impacts, why would you run a high-risk strategy?” The parents Speak to most teachers, and they’ll tell you that they believe a new online group is twisting the national conversation around schools during Covid. Us For Them – which styles itself as a “grass-roots” parent lobby group – has too much influence in the thinking of the Scottish Government, teachers feel. UFT exists primarily on Facebook and sprang to life during lockdown. Flanagan calls them “the parents from nowhere” – although some figures such as Lord Jack McConnell, former Labour First Minister, has offered them support online. Certainly, UFT doesn’t take the constructive approach to parent-teacher relations of established groups like the National Parent Forum of Scotland. Teachers have accused UFT of undisclosed political connections. There have been claims of an anti-SNP agenda. Flanagan accused the organisation of having a “strong core of Covid deniers”. The EIS and UFT have been engaged in a war of words over claims that teachers were being recorded. Many teachers, Flanagan says, “feel they’re in state of siege”. He claims UFT is a “platform for self-promotion … some of them have political ambitions”. Flanagan says he doesn’t in any way “dismiss the concerns of parents around blended and remote learning” but UFT has “an anti-teacher agenda”. He worries that the organisation is “manipulating the concerns of parents”, and that “their language and attitude [is] intimidating”. Teachers are “concerned that Government pays too much attention” to the group, Flanagan says. He speculated that Sturgeon was not “immune” to the organisation “as she reacted to them very quickly last lockdown”. Jo Bisset is the face of UFT in Scotland. She won’t offer any solutions to help make schools safer. “Schools are safe,” Bisset claims, adding: “We don’t see ourselves as having to solve a problem as it’s not a problem we acknowledge.” “We don’t see there’s any need for social distancing in schools … it isn’t a dangerous environment,” she says. Bisset claims that “face masks in schools are really inappropriate”, and references children with autism, hearing impairment and “selective mutism”. She claims “there’s a huge amount of harm from this enforcement of masks” and “having a mask on children in schools doesn’t make any sense”. Nor does Bisset support teachers wearing masks. “If there are vulnerable teachers in schools and they feel they need to wear masks I think my first question would be ‘should that teacher really be in school if they’re so vulnerable’? … Perhaps, they should be furloughed.” Bisset insists that UFT isn’t anti-teacher. “We’re incredibly in favour of teachers,” she claims. Teachers, though, recount incidents of being abused on social media by people connected to UFT. Bisset says this could be people who’ve had “a bad day … and just spill their guts – people often don’t think that closely about what they’re writing on social media and quite frankly why should they?” On the group’s campaign against Government closure of schools, she says: “We’re not going to stop. There may or may not be an election coming up and we think that education is the issue of the election … if political parties aren’t listening to parents now, then they really need to, otherwise they’re going to lose votes.” Bisset says claims that “we’re funded by dark money and we’re all failed Tory candidates and we’ve some big political agenda is completely wrong”. She insists all funding is from the public through sites like GoFundMe. On political connections, she says: “Well, there’s this one guy, but he’s secret, he’s not actually an active politician now but he has been.” She later adds: “He was a Labour MP.” UFT praises MSPs like Alex Neil of the SNP, who has criticised blended learning as “absolutely unacceptable”, and Michelle Ballantyne, tje former Conservative now leading Nigel Farage’s Reform Party in Scotland. Ballantyne was accused a few days ago of “an anti-lockdown rant”. Bisset accused the EIS of “concerted smear attempts”. When asked if UFT could have handled debate better, she replied: “I don’t care. I’m not in politics … I’m not responsible for what nameless people write on the internet.” Teachers say that as UFT frontwoman she must take responsibility. Bisset claimed she’d “love” to work in a classroom unmasked, and doesn’t believe teachers need to socially distance from children. Asked whether this posed a wider infection risk, she claimed: “Coronavirus is principally transmitted adult to adult, so as long as adults are socially distancing then you’re massively reducing your risk – so you can socially distance adults … in schools far more easily than you can do in many other sectors. So for me, if I was a teacher in a school, my key goal would be to socially distance from adults.” Several teachers were asked to comment on this. All dismissed it as “dangerous” or “nonsense”. Bisset, who is from Edinburgh and works in the oil and gas sector, has two teenage children in a private school. When asked if it was unfair of her to comment on state education, she replied: “I don’t know why I’d have to have my children in state school in order to be able to point out a fact that children in the state sector will be getting worse … education typically.” She said “private schools will be delivering a much more comprehensive level of education”. The Government's response Responding to EIS comments, a government spokeswoman said: “Our top priority is the health and safety of pupils, staff and teachers. The current lockdown demonstrates that commitment to keeping people safe. While decisions to move to remote learning are hard, they have been taken in a timely manner in light of the developing public heath position. While we acknowledge the long-standing campaign by Mr Flanagan to have schools closed, we believe that shift came at the right time. “Overall, we believe that the support in place for pupils learning remotely has been well-received. This includes, by the end of December, almost 59,000 devices such as laptops and over 10,000 connectivity packages distributed to learners. In total, the programme, supported by a £25 million investment, is expected to deliver over 70,000 devices for disadvantaged children and young people. A new package of £45 million, announced last week, means councils can supply additional devices or family support to those who need it most. That is substantial and is making a significant difference to the learning that pupils are receiving.”",Majority of Britons think police have lost control of the streets,partially false

Kids in reception, year 1 and year 6 returned to class this morning for the first time since schools were closed more than two months ago. While ministers have insisted the time is right to ease the lockdown, almost half of parents are expected to not send their kids to class today. According to the National Foundation for Educational Research, heads in England are expecting nearly half 46% of families to keep their children at home. This means that of the more than 2 million students in reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, about 1 million are likely to stay at home. But students were pictured smiling as they headed back to school - delighted to see their school pals after ten weeks apart.

But Government leaders have stressed social distancing measures must stay in place, particularly staying two metres apart from someone outside your household.

In Bristol, Ashton Gate Primary School in Southville was one of few schools there to restart classes this morning. Mum Angie Parker, 47, dropped her daughter off to resume Year 6, saying: I'm going against my instincts, in all honesty. I think it's too soon for the schools to be opening. But this school has been so remarkable. The staff have been amazing. The detail they have gone into - that's why [the children] are here. I'm happy to override my gut reaction to support this moving forward. Rachel Mostyn, 43, was also dropping her daughter off to rejoin Year 6. She said: My feeling is that the school has done everything they can to make the children safe. I have complete faith in what they are doing. It comes after Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: “The risks to children of this disease are much lower. We know that — they are at very low risk.” Yet findings from a recent PA news agency survey of local authorities show that more than 20 councils across England - predominantly in the north - are also advising schools not to open to more pupils this week. Some of those polled have claimed that the NHS Test and Trace system will not be robust enough to allay fears over the potential spreading of the virus due to difficulty maintaining social distancing.",,TRUE
c88a4819,"More than 300 people referred to a deradicalisation scheme between June and August were under 18, figures show. Of the 796 individuals reported to the government’s Channel programme for possible intervention, 312 were under 18, statistics obtained by the Press Association show. Part of the Prevent counter-terrorism programme, Channel was developed to provide support to people at risk of being drawn into violent extremism. The programme came under the spotlight last week when it emerged that a 14-year-old boy, described as Britain’s youngest terrorist, was referred to the voluntary initiative. The teenager was given a life sentence for plotting a thwarted terror attack in Australia. The referral figures, provided by the National Police Chiefs’ Council following a freedom of information request have been published after new measures were introduced placing a legal requirement on schools and other public bodies to prevent people being drawn into terrorism – defined as not just violent extremism, but also non-violent extremism that can “create an atmosphere conducive to terrorism and popularise views which terrorists exploit”. When the law came into force in July, there were 349 referrals – a rate of more than 10 every day. This was a slight increase on the previous month, when there were 327, while the number fell to 120 in August when schools broke up for the summer. There were more referrals between June and August than for the whole of 2012/13 – the first year the scheme was rolled out across England and Wales. The number is more than double the level of referrals recorded in the first three months of 2014/15. Specific details of Channel projects – piloted in 2007 – are not made public, but they are aimed at all forms of terrorism, including far-right extremism. Government guidance states the programme is “about ensuring that vulnerable children and adults of any faith, ethnicity or background receive support before their vulnerabilities are exploited by those that would want them to embrace terrorism”. Not all of those referred are subsequently judged as being vulnerable to radicalisation. Estimates suggest that one in five cases were assessed as needing support from Channel programmes, with the rest passed to other more appropriate services. Rashad Ali, a senior fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, said the rise in referrals was to be expected, because of the new law, increased outreach from authorities and schools, and greater awareness of the issues involved. “Channel should be seen as an early intervention programme similar to those targeting truancy and drugs, rather than a programme for targeting extremists, which is something for the police and intelligence agencies,” he said. “It’s been politicised by all sides of the political spectrum. The right uses it stir up mass hysteria over the threat of extremists while the left sees it as a government attempt to target whole communities.” The government is due to publish its counter-extremism bill later this year, which is aimed at “suppressing extremist activity”. It will include proposals for banning orders to outlaw extremist organisations, extremist disruption orders to restrict the activities of individuals, and closure orders to shut down premises used by extremists. But David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism laws, has warned that the bill risks provoking a backlash in Britain’s Muslim communities and playing into the hands of terrorist recruiters. The bill also risks legitimising state scrutiny of – and citizens informing on – the political activities of large numbers of law-abiding people, he said. Several recent cases have highlighted the difficulty in implementing anti-extremism programmes. In a case that emerged last month, a 14-year-old Muslim schoolboy was questioned about Isis after a classroom discussion about environmental activism. His parents are taking legal action after the boy said he was left “scared and nervous” by his experience with school officials in north London, and was left reluctant to join in class discussions for fear of being suspected of extremism.",Did Climate Change Intensify Hurricane Harvey?,TRUE

c428e644,"Postcards from the Great Divide is a series of nine short documentaries in nine different states examining the deeply partisan split among the American electorate. Each Postcard brings a specific political issue to life, providing an in-depth look at a specific demographic or partisan environment. Black voters in Florida hesitating to vote post-Obama; urban and rural Minnesota residents distancing themselves based on political views; Wisconsin ex-legislators ruing the intense ideological splits that have turned the once congenial state into a partisan battleground; the differing challenges of getting out the Latino vote in Texas and Nevada; GOP strategy to capture a state government in Washington and Republican dominance in the South in Kentucky; national money creating a larger partisan divide in a local election in Colorado and one activist’s mission to resurrect the Democrats in deep red Nebraska. Louis Alvarez, Andrew Kolker, and Paul Stekler executive produced the series and collaborated with six independent filmmakers to make the films, all produced in a digital partnership between PBS’ Election 2016 initiative and The Washington Post, funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Latino Public Broadcasting, with a PBS broadcast on the World Channel. All the films are viewable at www.politicalpostcards.org. Getting Back to Abnormal is about New Orleans politics and race relations after Katrina. In the context of the city’s long history of political dysfunction and complicated race relations, the film focuses on Stacy Head, a take no prisoners white woman representing a black majority district for city council after Katrina, and her irrepressible African-American aide Barbara Lacen-Keller as they try and navigate New Orleans’ treacherous political scene in a campaign for re-election. With a cast of only-in-New-Orleans characters, and interwoven with stories about housing, culture, and history, Getting Back to Abnormal is a provocative and entertaining look at race in America, set against the backdrop of city’s most unique city. Made with his frequent collaborators Louis Alvarez, Andy Kolker and Peter Odabashian (Vote for Me: Politics in America, Louisiana Boys: Raised on Politics), the film premiered at South by Southwest in 2013 and aired nationally on PBS’s POV series in 2014. The Los Angeles Times described it as “poetry… every frame is full of life”; the New Orleans Advocate called it “raucous and brilliant”; The Boston Globe found it to be “a gritty, street-level look at a unique city”; “an entertaining portrayal of New Orleans in all its glorious dysfunction,” wrote the Austin American-Statesman; The Washington Post said, “a fabulous introduction to N’awlins-style politics”; and National Journalcalled it “a film unlike any you have ever seen before.” It's the fourth documentary that some combination of Stekler and his collaborators had broadcast on POV, one each in the last four decades. Stekler’s feature article, “Documenting New Orleans on Film,” is both a look at the history of documentary films about the Crescent City and puts Getting Back to Abnormal in context.

525de9d7,"A ruling by European human rights judges has forced police to warn gangsters that their lives might be in danger - at vast expense to taxpayers. An ex-justice minister last night revealed how senior officers are having to spend time and money issuing the villains and drug lords with 'threat to life notices'. This is despite the fact they are putting themselves in peril through their own actions and it is diverting resources away from protecting 'innocent, law-abiding citizens'. The European Court of Human Rights has decided that not passing on intelligence that another gangster wants to hurt them infringes their right to life. The European Court of Human Rights has decided that not passing on intelligence that another gangster wants to hurt them infringes their right to life meaning police are having to tell them Dominic Raab, who left the Government in July, said the farce had been exposed to him by police as he gathered evidence for a British Bill of Rights He told House magazine: 'One of the things that happened because of Strasbourg – not the European Convention itself, but the judges – is they expanded through mission creep the scope of the Convention without any democratic accountability, to say that if police forces were aware of a risk to someone they must notify them. 'Now, that may be good policy. But turning it into a human right that can be enforced in court is crazy. 'One of the things I learnt as we started to gather evidence for the Bill of Rights, talking to Greater Manchester police, is that they now - as a result of that ruling - have to give tip-offs and notify gangsters who are fighting each other. And that absorbs a huge amount of their time. 'Now I'm not saying you should let gangsters fight it out, but I don't see why police resources – and this was the evidence we heard – should be displaced giving threat to life notices and tipping off gangsters who are engaged in gang warfare with each other, when I would like to see that taxpayer's money and police focus on dealing with and prioritising threats to innocent, law-abiding citizens.' He added: 'It's crazy that the unchecked expansion of human rights means precious police resources are squandered protecting gangsters from each other - rather than prioritised to protect law-abiding citizens.' The revelations will trigger new controversy over the failure by David Cameron's Government to scrap the Human Rights Act or take Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights. David Cameron promised a decade ago to take firm action to end abuse of human rights law but the plans remained on the drawing board. Proposals by Mr Raab and former justice secretary Michael Gove were shelved as a result of the referendum. The new Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, is now reviewing the plans – with no date fixed for their publication. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out leaving the court altogether. She is in favour of full withdrawal but accepted that the plans would not be approved by Parliament. The ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg pictured has forced police to warn gangsters that their lives might be in danger - at vast expense to taxpayers Earlier this month, Mrs Truss told MPs: 'There are changes that could be made but that is really a matter that we need to develop in the proposals that we will be putting forward in due course.' There have been at least 2,000 'threat to life' notices issued by 27 police forces who answered freedom of Information requests in the UK since 2012. The true figure will be far higher as the likes of West Midlands, Merseyside and Greater Manchester did not reply. The letters - also known as Osman warnings - are issued by police if they become aware of a 'real and immediate' threat to somebody's life, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the possible offender. They are named after Ali Osman, who was murdered by Paul Paget-Lewis, a teacher at his son's school, in 1988. Paget-Lewis formed a 'disturbing' attachment to Mr Osman's 14-year-old son Ahmet, then 14, and at one point told police he was considering committing a massacre. In March 1988, he stole a gun, killed Mr Osman and shot and seriously injured Ahmet. The Osman family successfully argued in the European Court of Human Rights that the Metropolitan Police had breached Mr Osman's right to life because it had all the information it needed to deal with the threat. The National Police Chiefs Council insists that Osman warnings have proved 'highly effective in the overwhelming majority of cases.'",Colorado Rockies Baseball Team To Sell Marijuana Brownies At Their Concession Stands,TRUE
4b49e411,"Average weekly wages in the UK have reached their highest levels since before the financial crisis. Weekly pay reached £512 in the three months to December, which - adjusting for inflation - is the highest since March 2008. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the three-month period, official figures show. Employment rose by 180,000 to another record high of 32.93 million, while unemployment stayed at 1.29 million. The figures from the Office for National Statistics ONS showed the number of women in employment increased again - this time by 150,000 in the three months to December to a record high of 15.61 million. Real wages graphimage copyrightAFP Myrto Miltiadou, of the ONS, said: In real terms, regular earnings have finally risen above the level seen in early 2008, but pay including bonuses is still below its pre-downturn peak. Employment has continued its upward trend, with the rate nudging up to another record high. In particular, the number of women working full-time grew strongly over the past year. HSBC signals mass job cuts as profits plunge Inflation at lowest for more than three years Employment Minister Mims Davies said: As we embark on a new chapter as an independent nation outside the EU, we do so with a record-breaking jobs market and business confidence on the rise. With wages still outpacing inflation, UK workers can expect their money to go further as we look ahead to a decade of renewal. line Analysis box by Andy Verity, economics correspondent It's always good to have some cheerful news to report, such as the news that wages, after stripping out the effect of inflation, have finally squeaked above their level in March 2008. In other words, your wage can finally buy a little bit more than it could before the banking crisis. So let's celebrate. Hooray. Now let's home in on the amounts. The average wage excluding bonuses is now £511.61. In March 2008, the average wage would have bought you £510.96 in 2019 prices. In other words you are 65p better off than you were - 12 years ago. There's always a half-full or a half-empty angle on wage increases. But to many workers, this minor economic landmark will serve less as a cause for celebration and more as a reminder that the past decade has been the worst for improvements in living standards in more than 200 years. The 2008 crisis, caused in part by reckless mismanagement of the banks, is one reason not the only one that the average pay packet has failed to do what we used to take for granted - i.e. increase by more than inflation. It used to happen every year. Low-pay think tank the Resolution Foundation points out that if pre-crisis trends for increases in pay in real terms had continued, the average wage would now be £141 a week higher. line Employment rate graph Thomas Pugh, at Capital Economics, said the employment figures proved the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee MPC was right to leave interest rates unchanged last month. The most recent surveys are suggesting that employment growth will continue to pick-up in Q1, which we think will contribute to the MPC keeping rates on hold at its next meeting on 26 March as well, he said. However, the Institute of Directors warned: The UK jobs market ended last year in fine form, but 2020 may be more challenging for employers. As more and more workers enter employment, it becomes harder for firms to recruit the employees they need, with a particular dearth in certain skill sets. And Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. said: The upside surprise to employment growth distracts from an otherwise slightly disappointing report.

dca535c0,"TRENTON — In a widely anticipated decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the state to spend an additional $500 million on public education in poor districts next year. The complex decision does not boost funding statewide, as education advocates had requested, and may avoid creating a gaping hole in a proposed $29.6 billion budget. The 3-2 ruling, however, revealed sharp disagreements among the five justices who heard the case and issued a total of four opinions. Justices could have ordered up to $1.7 billion in additional statewide education spending. Today's ruling gives Gov. Chris Christie and lawmakers some room to maneuver as they work to balance the state's budget by July 1. Christie had argued that the state's current fiscal woes made it impossible to spend the full amount required by the funding formula approved by the court in 2009. Still, the majority opinion written by Associate Justice Jaynee LaVecchia said Christie's cuts to education spending have been ""consequential and significant"" and must be rolled back. She also wrote that the state, which had promised to fully fund the formula, cannot back away from it when funding poor districts. TODAY'S COVERAGE: • Gov. Christie: Legislature must decide how to fund Supreme Court Abbott decision • Senate President Sweeney, lawmakers react to N.J. Supreme Court decision restoring $500M to Abbott districts • Read the complete ruling (PDF) ""Indeed, our holding in (the 2009 case) was a good-faith demonstration of deference to the political branches’ authority, not an invitation to retreat from the hard-won progress that our state had made toward guaranteeing the children in Abbott districts the promise of educational opportunity,"" she wrote. ""Regrettably, the state did not honor its commitment."" The court's decision stems from a legal battle over whether Christie's cuts to education spending last year were unconstitutional. The Newark-based Education Law Center, which brought the lawsuit against the state, argued that the cuts violated the state's constitutional requirement to provide a ""thorough and efficient system of free public schools."" In response, the Christie administration said the state doesn't have enough money to spend more on schools and argued that the court should not inject itself into the budget-making process. Conservatives including Christie have fiercely criticized the court's actions over the years, saying justices have mistakenly treated more funding as a cure-all for poor districts' education woes. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: • Christie refuses to talk about flouting N.J. Supreme Court if it orders more school funding • If N.J. Supreme Court orders increased school aid, Gov. Christie says not complying is among 'options' • Gov. Christie's legal team tells N.J. Supreme Court to keep hands off education dollars • Judge says Christie's school budget cuts violated constitution, fell heavily on high-risk districts • N.J. Supreme Court to hear arguments on constitutionality of Christie's education budget cuts • Education Law Center motion could restore N.J. school funding cut by Gov. Christie • The History of Abbott v. Burke The court’s decision caps the latest round in the historic and controversial school funding case Abbott v. Burke, which has routed billions of dollars to the state’s neediest students over the past three decades in an effort to equalize spending between New Jersey’s poorest and wealthiest districts. Because the original lawsuit, filed in 1981, was brought on behalf of only 31 poor school districts, the court narrowed its ruling to affect only the so-called ""Abbott districts."" ""Although we are sympathetic to the difficulties that the state’s failure to abide by its statutory formula for education funding has caused to children in districts statewide, we are limited in our ability to order relief in this matter,"" LaVecchia wrote. She added, ""The Abbott litigation has proceeded with two distinct adversarial parties: on the one side, New Jersey schoolchildren who attend schools in certain constitutionally deficient districts; and on the other side, the state, who has defended its funding schemes as consistent with the thorough and efficient clause."" The decision released today was apparently influenced by a March report written by Superior Court Judge Peter Doyne, who was appointed by the court as a ""special master"" to study the issue and issue recommendations. Doyne concluded that funding cuts disproportionately harmed at-risk students in poor districts, breaking the state's constitutional obligations. ""Despite the state's best efforts, the reductions fell more heavily upon our high-risk districts and the children educated within those districts,"" Doyne wrote. In a concurring opinion, Associate Justice Barry Albin, who has been the target of much of Christie's criticism surrounding this case, argued that funding should be increased in 205 school districts attended by 72 percent of the state's at-risk students. ""Those school districts were constitutionally shortchanged in the amount of $972,930,819 for FY 2011 under (the school funding formula),"" Albin wrote. ""We cannot undo the past for the affected at-risk children; we can remediate their future."" Associate Justice Roberto Rivera-Soto dissented, arguing that there weren't enough affirmative votes to require the state to follow the order. Joined by Associate Justice Helen Hoens, he argued that, as a matter of practice, four affirmative votes are needed to grant a motion. ""Although unwritten, that practice is borne out by the relevant empirical data,"" Rivera-Soto wrote. He said the only cases decided by a 3-2 decision were temporary injunctions, not permanent rulings. Because of the gravity of the case, he wrote, ""it is simply incomprehensible that any impartial observer would give them equal dignity."" Chief Justice Stuart Rabner and Associate Justice Virginia Long had recused themselves from the case, leaving five justices. LaVecchia, in the majority decision, rejected the arguments made by Rivera-Soto and Hoens. ""The dissenters’ transparent attempt at nullification of a decision with which they disagree fails on every factual and legal basis,"" she wrote. In another dissenting opinion, Hoens argued that the court was outside of its power to force more spending. ""Nothing in this record supports any of those essential findings,"" she wrote. Hoens was joined by Rivera-Soto in the dissent. Staff writers Jessica Calefati, Ginger Gibson and Jeanette Rundquist contributed to this report.

47213277,"The number of people living with diabetes in the UK has tipped over the 4 million mark for the first time, according to new figures released today by Diabetes UK. The new figures, extracted from GP patient data [1], show that there are now 4.05 million people with the condition in the UK, which includes 3.5 million adults who have been diagnosed, an increase of 119,965 compared to the previous year, and an increase of 65 per cent over the past decade. There are also thought to be 549,000 people with undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes. Urgent need for adequate diabetes care As the number of people living with the condition continues to escalate, Diabetes UK is warning that the need for the NHS to commit to providing adequate care and diabetes education across the UK is more urgent than ever. Until this happens – and the National Audit Office recently criticised the often poor standard of care – large numbers of people will end up experiencing potentially preventable diabetes-related complications such as blindness, kidney failure and amputation. At the moment, more than 24,000 people a year with diabetes die before their time, which is because: Only 60 per cent of people with diabetes are getting the eight NICE recommended checks [2], which are key to identifying any problems early enough to prevent complications. Diabetes education courses are not being commissioned for people in over a third of areas in England [3]. Hospital care for people with diabetes is consistently poor and, in a significant minority of cases, is putting people’s lives at risk. This is despite clear evidence that improving care would help avoid health complications that, as well as being personally devastating, account for 80 per cent of the NHS’ £10 billion annual spend on diabetes. We are also calling for a greater focus on preventing Type 2 diabetes, which is vital in stemming the rise of Type 2 diabetes. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme – a joint commitment from NHS England, Public Health England and Diabetes UK to deliver at scale evidence based behavioural interventions for individuals identified as being at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes – is an important first step but more needs to be done to help people lead healthy lifestyles from the beginning to the ends of their lives. Denied both care and access to education Chris Askew, Chief Executive of Diabetes UK, said: “With 4 million people in the UK now living with diabetes, the need to tackle this serious health condition has never been so stark or so urgent. Tragically, we are continuing to see too many people with diabetes suffering serious complications, and even dying before their time, and we know that key reasons for this are that they are being denied both the care and access to education that would help them to manage their condition well. Diabetes education needs to be readily available It is vital that we start to see people with diabetes receive good quality care wherever they live rather than them being at the mercy of a postcode lottery. Equally, diabetes education needs to be readily available everywhere, and commissioned along with a proper local system that explains to people with diabetes the benefits they will gain from attending an education course, and ensures that courses are well run. “We also need a concerted effort led by the Government to take active steps to address the fact that almost two in every three people in the UK are overweight or obese and are therefore at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Basic measures such as making healthy food cheaper and more accessible, introducing clearer food labelling and making it easier for people to build physical activity into their daily lives would have a profound influence. No time to waste “With a record number of people living with diabetes, there is no time to waste in getting serious about providing better care and diabetes education. Until this happens, the rising number of people with diabetes will continue to be denied the best chance of living long and healthy lives and the NHS will continue to be crippled under avoidable but escalating costs of treating poorly managed diabetes.

59c7030a,"A Catholic school in Kentucky has condemned a group of its students after they were recorded harassing a Native American Vietnam veteran in a video that went viral on Saturday. The students, many of whom were wearing “Make America Great Again” caps, from private, all-male Covington Catholic High School in Park Hillswere in Washington for an anti-abortion rally on Friday when they were filmed surrounding Nathan Phillips and mocking the Native American’s singing and drumming. One teen in particular is seen standing in front of Phillips, staring into his face with a smile. Fellow students, many in hats and sweatshirts with President Donald Trump’s “MAGA” slogan, cheered him on and chanted, “build the wall, build the wall”, Phillips said. The footage was shared online by organizers of an indigenous peoples’ march that also took place on Friday. The video prompted a torrent of outrage online. Actress and activist Alyssa Milano tweeted that the footage “brought me to tears”, while actor Chris Evans tweeted that the students’ actions were “appalling” and “shameful”. In a joint statement, the high school and Diocese of Covington condemned the actions of the students “towards Nathan Phillips specifically, and Native Americans in general”. “We extend our deepest apologies to Mr. Phillips,” the statement read. “This behavior is opposed to the Church’s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person.” “The matter is being investigated and we will take appropriate action, up to and including expulsion.” Covington Mayor Joe Meyer, a Democrat, said the “appalling” footage had rightly inspired “a tidal wave of condemnation” and that his town was now being linked with “intolerance and ethnic intimidation” because of the boys’ actions. “The videos being shared across the nation do NOT represent the core beliefs and values of this city,” he said in a statement. In a separate video uploaded to social media, the 64-year-old Phillips, an elder of Nebraska’s Omaha tribe, wiped away tears as he described the incident. “I heard them saying ‘build that wall, build that wall’. These are indigenous lands, we’re not supposed to have walls,” he said. “I wish I could see that energy of that young mass of young men, put that energy into making this country, really, really great, helping those that are hungry.” He told The Washington Post that while he was drumming, he thought about his wife, Shoshana, who died of bone marrow cancer nearly four years ago, and the threats that indigenous communities around the world are facing. “I felt like the spirit was talking through me,” Phillips said. Phillips holds an annual ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery to honor Native American veterans, according to media reports. He is a well-known Native American activist who was among those leading the Standing Rock protests in 2016-2017 against the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota. Democratic US Congresswoman Deb Haaland, a member of New Mexico’s Laguna Pueblo tribe, said on Twitter that Phillips had risked his life for his country, and that the students showed “blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance”.

As we consider what this law may do to our country, I can't help but reflect on a medical miracle made possible by the American health-care system. It's one that holds special meaning for me. Some years ago, a little girl was born with a serious heart defect: Her aorta and pulmonary artery were reversed. Without immediate intervention, she would not have survived. The infant was rushed to another hospital where a surgeon performed a procedure at 1 a.m. that saved her life. Eight months later, when her heart was the size of a small plum, an incredibly dedicated and skilled team of medical professionals surgically reconstructed it. Twenty-seven years later, the young woman is now a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit where she is studying to become a nurse practitioner.

Instead, her care was provided under a run-of-the-mill plan available to every employee of an Oshkosh, Wis., plastics plant.

And my wife and I are incredibly thankful that we had the freedom to seek out the most advanced surgical technique.

223a797d,"(CNN) From the moment a child is born, its gender pretty much determines how they will dress, which toys they'll be given and ultimately how they are meant to behave within society. But some schools in Sweden are trying to strip away such gender norms. There's nothing obviously out of the ordinary at Sweden's gender-neutral preschools at first glance. There are no designated areas to play with dolls or building blocks. The toys have been strategically jumbled to create an environment for girls and boys to play together. These two preschools in Sweden -- Nicolaigarden and Egalia (meaning 'equality' in Latin) -- go to great lengths to de-emphasize gender. Children are given the freedom to challenge and cross gender boundaries. Rather than encourage children to do particular things, the teachers are careful not to box children based on their gender or subtly discourage them from doing certain things. The school has removed the terms ""girl"" and ""boy"" completely. Instead they make a deliberate effort to call each child by their first name or the gender-neutral pronoun ""hen"". But is it necessary to intervene at such a young age, and what are the long-term effects? Children play in the garden of Egalia. Removing the 'gender straitjacket' A new global study found that young girls and boys are outfitted with ""gender straitjackets"" by the age of 10 , resulting in lifelong negative consequences. The Global Early Adolescent Study analyzed how gender is learned, enforced and reinforced among early adolescents in 15 countries. It concluded that culturally-enforced gender stereotypes -- which are linked to an increased risk of mental and physical health problems -- are firmly rooted between the ages of 10 and 14. The study found these stereotypes leave girls at greater risk of exposure to physical and sexual violence, child marriage, and HIV. For boys, the risks can include substance abuse and suicide. In Sweden, which is ranked as the fourth-most equal country in the world when it comes to gender, the government has made a concerted effort to emphasize equality in the Education Act. Following a new amendment introduced in 1998 requiring all schools to work against gender stereotyping, Lotta Rajalin set up her first gender-neutral preschool for one to five-year-olds in Stockholm's Old Town. The gender-neutral policies at Rajalin's schools ensure that stories, songs and dramatizations are screened or re-scripted to include non-nuclear families (single parents or same-sex couples) and heroines sweeping princes off their feet. Teachers opt for non-traditional plot twists to ensure that they're not reinforcing gender stereotypes.

Students from nursery to high school learn how to be more environmentally-conscious while studying traditional topics like math and languages. The Green School boasts a diverse student body from all over the world and aims to create the next generation of green leaders. The school runs on three simple principles: be local, let the environment lead and think of your grandchildren's future.

Students in these areas are unable to study after it gets dark, which hinders their chances of getting into a secondary school. So Empower Playgrounds created merry-go-rounds that use the children's energy to charge a battery, which then powers a small lantern.

In some schools in Canada and the U.S., for example, recent trends of creating more comfortable and open classrooms have seen traditional desks disappear. Instead, bouncy balls, bean bags and seating mats having taken their place, while iPads and computers replace traditional pen and paper. Students submit their work via different tools, such as Google Classroom, and teachers are able to give feedback and mark assignments in real time. Even chalkboards and whiteboards are being replaced by interactive smartboards.

Their philosophy is to encourage personalized learning by giving their students, all of primary age, more control. Pupils choose which subjects they study, how they want to learn and at what pace. Teachers are known as coaches and students are grouped not by age but by their strengths and interests. Schedules are flexible and students are each given an iPad.

According to the Danish Forest and Nature Agency, over 10 percent of Danish preschools are located in forests or other natural settings. These schools use their surroundings as teaching tools, where eating organic food, hiking and raising chickens are all part of the daily lessons. Proponents of forest preschools say that children develop better motor skills when there is more space and time to play in nature rather than sitting in a classroom.

Hide Caption 10 of 10 How to be a gender-neutral teacher Perhaps the most important distinction in these preschools is the way the teachers treat each child. To help identify any unconscious bias they have when dealing with girls and boys, the teachers filmed themselves interacting with children and took note of how they responded to the different sexes. ""After we had been filming and observing each other, we understood that it's not the children we have to change, it's ourselves,"" Rajalin tells CNN. Lotta Rajalin, director at Nicolaigarden and Egalia gender-neutral preschools. They discovered they used different tones of voice when talking to girls or boys, and tolerated rowdiness in boys while discouraging it in girls. Similarly, they found themselves to be more likely to comfort a crying girl, while they would tell a crying boy to brush it off. ""When you change yourself and your thinking and your expectations, you will see new things and you will see that it's better for children's development,"" she says. Rajalin believes gender stereotypes limit the opportunities available to a child. Her gender-neutral teaching methods stem from what she calls ""the whole life spectra"" or ""circle of opportunity."" This circle is often divided into two semi-circles -- one for boys and one for girls. Through gender-neutral teaching, Rajalin hopes to open up this circle of opportunities for all children to define themselves. ""We try to take away the barriers which stop both girls and boys doing what they want to do,"" she says. ""We want all children to have the same opportunities to feel, to express themselves, to like what color they like, to play the sport they're in, and so on. We don't want to limit them."" Following a small, structured observation of children at one of Rajalin's preschools, Ben Kenward, a researcher in psychology at Uppsala University in Sweden and Oxford Brookes University in England, found these children had a reduced tendency to be influenced by gender stereotypes, compared to a control group of children from a typical Swedish preschool. ""The [gender neutral] pedagogy is having some of the effects that it's intended to have, and if you're committed to giving these young children the same opportunities ... then our study suggests that this kind of pedagogy is a good tool."" 'Brainwashing children' However, these gender-neutral policies have generated much criticism over the years. Swedish psychiatrist and author David Eberhard considers calling boys and girls ""hen"" to be ""intellectually dishonest"" as it is being ""blind to biological differences."" ""This is the kind of brainwash that works when the kids are small and in the short run they adapt to this, but what happens when they go to normal school and they find out they were living in a sect?"" he tells CNN. ""This is a sort of a religious sect to say there's no differences between men and women, it has nothing to do with science."" Eberhard explained that he does not oppose boys choosing to play with dolls, but he draws the line at calling a girl or boy ""it"" or ""hen"". Rajalin believes a lot of criticism is misguided, as people do not fully understand what they are trying to do. ""We are not trying to say girls should be boys or boys should be girls, we just want every person to have the right to be the person they are, regardless of gender,"" she says. Rajalin says her gender-neutral preschools give children the same opportunities, obligations and rights, regardless of gender. Harmless 'experiment' While Eberhard's views are strong, he says gender-neutral schooling is unlikely to have any negative long-term effects on young children. ""I suppose that they [the children] are so sure about their identity that it doesn't matter,"" he says. ""But, as individuals, you may very well have young kids of different sexes that become very frustrated or confused."" He believes Sweden would be better off solving the problem of gender inequality in the real world. Rajalin, however, believes adopting gender-neutral methods and exposing children to teachers of various different ethnicities, religions, sexes and sexual orientations, will better prepare them for the nuances of the real world. It will boost their self-confidence and set them up to be more successful in life, she says. Psychology professor Philip Hwang from the University of Gothenburg is not convinced. He thinks Rajalin's gender-neutral preschools are harmless but overrated. ""I don't really see any harm in it, but I think it pleases the parents more than it changes the children,"" he tells CNN. He says he has met a couple of parents that really believe sending their children to gender-neutral preschool will have lasting effects and that they will grow up in a gender-neutral society. ""It's a statement more than something that has actual effect on children's long-term development with regard to gender issues,"" he says. ""It takes generations to change norms and values like this."" Even Kenward, who is optimistic that the gender-neutral pedagogy is creating equal opportunities for children of both genders, is unsure what the long-term effects will be. ""It's an open question what happens to these children when they move into primary school,"" he says. ""My guess is it [gender neutral pedagogy] could continue to influence their behavior potentially, not in a very strong way necessarily. But it may have some lasting effects.""",Trump's Tariffs Look Like a Self-Inflicted Wound,TRUE

It's the 73rd herd to be diagnosed in the state since 1998, according to the Associated Press. Cattle in Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda must be tested before leaving their farms. Although bovine TB largely affects cattle, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources notes that the disease can be transferred between farm animals and wildlife. It shows up in the lungs, intestines and other parts of the body in animals. Michigan wildlife managers are also working to eradicate the disease from white-tailed deer in the state, reported Fox-TV (Mobile, Ala.). Hunters should look for lesions on deer's lymph nodes, lungs or the rest of the body while dressing deer. Meanwhile, farmers in the area should aim to keep deer away from cattle, assistant State Veterinarian Nancy Barr told the Associated Press.

88a75bcc,"A 30-year old man from Kentucky underwent some radical plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Jesus Christ. According to the Lexington Daily Tribune, Mark Emery has already been following Jesus’ footsteps in many different ways for several years, becoming a carpenter himself, as well as studying ancient Jewish law and religious texts. He went so far as to spend more than $215,000 on two years worth of plastic surgery to change his physical appearance to resemble Jesus. After undergoing a total of 21 surgical interventions, he claims to be “almost satisfied” with the results. “Some people buy fancy cars or fancy mansions… I use my money to show my love for Jesus by getting surgery to look more like him,” says Mr. Emery. “I try to live by his example and to be as much like him as I can. For me, acting like Jesus wasn’t enough, I really wanted to be like him and look like him.” The young man used various images and icons in order to determine the actual appearance of Christ before beginning his various surgeries. Many critics have already arisen in the social media, both denouncing or mocking Mr. Emery’s attempt to resemble Jesus Christ. Hundreds of people, including various religious leaders, have made some religiously oriented critics, denouncing as “blasphemy” or “heresy” his desire to physically imitate the appearance of Christ. “Christians love Jesus and try to act like him, not look like him. Shame on you. That’s ridiculous and anti-Christian” wrote Pastor John Hagee on his Twitter account. Many critics have also described Mr. Emery’s surgery as “ridiculous” since the physical appearance of Jesus Christ remains unclear and is still subject to a lot of debate. A special on PBS special put together a large study to determine what Jesus must have looked like, and this is the result they obtained. The Bible itself gives no physical description of Jesus in the sense of describing his skin tone, hair style, or facial traits. Many theories have been elaborated by scholars over the years, some of them incredibly far-fetched, claiming that Jesus could have been West African, Egyptian or half-Roman among others, but none of these claims were backed on any proof. It is generally accepted among historians, that Jesus was not of European descent, as he is usually depicted on icons and crucifixes. He would instead have resembled a modern-day Arab, Turk or other middle eastern man, having a slightly darker skin color. Despite all these critics, Mr. Emery says that he is really happy with the results of his surgery, claiming that he now feels closer to Jesus than he had ever felt in his life.","Months after being denied media credentials for the Texas House, the conservative organization Texas Scorecard — a product of Empower Texans, a Tea Party-aligned political advocacy group with one of the state’s best-funded political action committees — has filed a First Amendment lawsuit arguing that its rejection from the lower chamber constitutes “unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.” Before the legislative session kicked off in January, two employees of Texas Scorecard, Brandon Waltens and Destin Sensky, applied for media credentials in both chambers of the Legislature. In the Senate, their credentials were granted; in the House, they were denied. The two chambers follow similar rules about who is allowed special journalistic access to the floor, and both prohibit lobbyists. But the chambers’ political atmospheres are different. House Administration Chair Charlie Geren, a Fort Worth Republican who has sparred with Empower Texans and its PAC in the past, told the group in a January rejection letter that it was ineligible for media credentials because “the organization you are employed by, Texas Scorecard, has a close association with a general-purpose political committee (GPAC) and that the organization’s website prominently displays advocacy on policy matters before the legislature.” As evidence of the group’s affiliation with the PAC, Geren cited the organizations' shared address — but by the time Geren’s letter was issued, the lawsuit claims, they no longer shared that address. Empower Texans PAC has backed primary opponents to Geren and has given Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads the Texas Senate, more than $850,000 in the last five years. In the lawsuit, filed this week in federal court in Austin, the organization alleges that its history with Geren — who, the complaint says, “has routinely and openly expressed hostility” to the group “on account of their publications” — led him to engage in “bad faith viewpoint discrimination.” It asks a federal judge to force Geren to issue media credentials to the two employees. Reached on the floor of the Texas House on Wednesday morning, Geren said he had no comment on the lawsuit. Empower Texans, which operates under several names, is a unique blend of political action committee, advocacy group and news outlet. During the session, it produces a biweekly newspaper and a weekday morning newsletter, as well as a weekly podcast and video broadcast. But the organization also directly advocates for specific votes on specific measures — releasing regular “vote notices” that call on elected officials to back its priorities — and ranks lawmakers on an A-F scale as either “pro-” or “anti-taxpayer.” Although they do not have media credentials in the Texas House, Waltens and Sensky — like anyone else — can sit in the public second-floor gallery. Only journalists, lawmakers, staff and special guests are permitted on the chambers’ floors, where they enjoy easier access to elected officials. The lawsuit alleges that “by denying plaintiffs access to the hall of the House equal to that afforded to other media representatives, [Geren] is violating Plaintiffs’ rights to free speech and freedom of the press.” The complaint claims that “no employee of Empower Texans is required to register as a lobbyist and the organization does not employ or contract with any person who is required to register as a lobbyist.” The organization has presented itself as a journalism outlet before. In 2017, Geren pulled a press pass that had been issued for another employee of the group, Cary Cheshire  Waltens and Sensky are common fixtures at the press table in the Texas Senate, where their coverage sometimes reflects the conservative bent of their organization. They have also reported on goings-on in the Texas House.",FALSE
53d111d0,"The primary school population in England has continued to rise sharply, with 94,000 extra pupils this year, reaching the highest levels since the 1970s. The 2.1% increase in primary numbers is equivalent to six more pupils for every school. Minority ethnic pupils made up 71% of the increase, says the Department for Education's school census report. The annual figures show there are now more super-sized primary schools. It will mean more funding demands to create extra places and pressure on places for families looking for schools. There are now 87 primary schools with more than 800 pupils, up from 77 in 2014 and 58 in 2013. The number of infants in classes above the limit of 30 pupils has increased again - with 100,800 pupils in these over-sized classes, an increase of 8% compared with 2014. The number has more than doubled since 2012, when there were about 47,000 infants in classes of more than 30. In 2008, the figure was fewer than 25,000. Changing demographics The figures from the annual school census show numbers rising across the state school system - up by 2.1% in primary and 0.1% in secondary - to a total of 8.4 million pupils. This is an increase of about 200,000 children in two years. The rising population has been a particular challenge for primary schools, which have been having to expand to absorb the increasing numbers. But this rising population wave has now reached secondary schools. The analysis says that the rise in primary school numbers is particularly driven by rising number of ethnic minority pupils, accounting for more than two-thirds of the increase. In primary schools, 30.4% of pupils are from an ethnic minority, compared with 29.5% the previous year. But there are wide regional variations. In the inner London boroughs, 81% of pupils are from ethnic minorities; while in north-east England, the figure is below 11%. And at council level, in Newham 94% of pupils are from ethnic minorities, while in Durham the figure is below 5%. In inner London, the biggest ethnic group in primary school are black pupils, predominantly from an African background, with Asian pupils the second biggest group. In secondary schools, about 27% of pupils are ethnic minorities, which the report says represents an increase of about 30% in six years. Despite the rising number of pupils there has not been a growth in the number of primary schools, which have been consistently falling since the 1980s. Instead, primary schools have been getting bigger, with more pupils in schools with more than 800 pupils. Primary pupil numbers had been declining until 2009, but they have been rising sharply since. 'Good local school' Funding this demand for extra places - forecast to be another 460,000 during the next five years - has been a continuing pressure on the schools budget. In the general election campaign, the Conservatives committed themselves to protecting per-pupil spending, including for rising numbers. A DfE spokesman said: The average infant class size has remained stable at 27.4 and the number of unlawfully large infant classes has fallen - down 137 compared to 2009 - all despite a small increase in pupil numbers since last year. To help schools respond to rising pupils numbers, the government invested £5bn between 2011 and 2015 to support local authorities - creating almost half a million new places. On top of that, we have committed to invest a further £7bn on new school places over the next six years, to support the new school places needed all the way up to September 2021. The government has also opened over 250 free schools since 2010 and we are committed to creating at least 500 more during this parliament, creating over 400,000 new school places and ensuring even more parents have access to a good local school for their child. Tristram Hunt, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: The growing pressures on primary school class sizes should compel the government to rethink how it is allocating funding for schools. The case is clear. In the early years of primary school, children in classes capped at 30 are more likely to make better progress. It cannot make sense for the government to continue to prioritise money for new free schools in areas with surplus school places when we have more than 100,000 primary pupils being taught in classes of more than 30.",,partially false

In a search of the vehicle, Flansburg collected a small quantity of heroin in a baggie. Woodward was then taken into custody by other troopers on the scene for processing on suspicion of possessing heroin, police said. Flansburg began to feel ill as he drove to the New Haven Barracks. When he arrived, he collapsed in the parking lot and was found unresponsive, police said. He was unresponsive when he was found by fellow troopers who immediately administered Narcan. In all, Flansburg received three doses of the opiate antidote in a row. He was rushed to UVM Medical Center in Burlington where he was treated and released, police said. Woodward was brought separately to UVMMC and did not need medical care. He will be arraigned May 6 in Vermont Superior Court, Criminal Division, in Middlebury. He faces a misdemeanor charge of heroin possession. The drug Flansburg was exposed to is being tested and the incident is under investigation. Col. Matthew Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in a press release that “being a state trooper is a dangerous and demanding job for all the reasons you’d expect: apprehending criminals, encountering volatile individuals, rushing toward emergencies rather than away. “Now there is a new threat that we’re seeing up close: the risk of exposure to powerful drugs that can kill in even tiny amounts,” Birmingham said. “This is so troubling and disconcerting, and it places members of law enforcement at unnecessary risk of possibly losing their lives.” “Were it not for the immediate availability of Narcan and the quick actions of his fellow troopers and medical personnel, we might be speaking today about the death of a trooper in the line of duty,” the colonel said. “I’m angry at how close we came, and relieved that the situation was no worse than it was.” Stay on top of all of Vermont's criminal justice news.

The extension will last 14 days from Monday night, after the initial 14 days lockdown. The president said this in his address to Nigerians. He thanked Nigerians for sacrifices made by complying with stay-at-home directives in order to check the spread of coronavirus. Read the full text of the president’s speech below. ADDRESS BY H.E. MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE EXTENSION OF COVID- 19 PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN AT THE STATE HOUSE, ABUJA MONDAY, 13TH APRIL, 2020 1. Fellow Nigerians 2. In my address on Sunday, 29th March, 2020, I asked the residents of Lagos and Ogun States as well as the Federal Capital Territory to stay at home for an initial period of fourteen days starting from Monday, 30th March 2020. 3. Many State Governments also introduced similar restrictions. 4. As your democratically elected leaders, we made this very difficult decision knowing fully well it will severely disrupt your livelihoods and bring undue hardship to you, your loved ones and your communities. 5. However, such sacrifices are needed to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our country. They were necessary to save lives. 6. Our objective was, and still remains, to contain the spread of the Coronavirus and to provide space, time and resources for an aggressive and collective action. 7. The level of compliance to the COVID-19 guidelines issued has been generally good across the country. I wish to thank you all most sincerely for the great sacrifice you are making for each other at this critical time. 8. I will take this opportunity to recognise the massive support from our traditional rulers, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) during this pandemic. 9. I also acknowledge the support and contributions received from public spirited individuals, the business community and our international partners and friends. 10. I must also thank the media houses, celebrities and other public figures for the great work they are doing in sensitizing our citizens on hygienic practices, social distancing and issues associated with social gatherings. 11. As a result of the overwhelming support and cooperation received, we were able to achieve a lot during these 14 days of initial lockdown. 12. We implemented comprehensive public health measures that intensified our case identification, testing, isolation and contact tracing capabilities. ADVERTISEMENT 13. To date, we have identified 92% of all identified contacts while doubling the number of testing laboratories in the country and raising our testing capacity to 1,500 tests per day. 14. We also trained over 7,000 Healthcare workers on infection prevention and control while deploying NCDC teams to 19 states of the federation. 15. Lagos and Abuja today have the capacity to admit some 1,000 patients each across several treatment centres. 16. Many State Governments have also made provisions for isolation wards and treatment centres. We will also build similar centers near our airports and land borders. 17. Using our resources and those provided through donations, we will adequately equip and man these centres in the coming weeks. Already, health care workers across all the treatment centers have been provided with the personal protective equipment that they need to safely carry out the care they provide. 18. Our hope and prayers are that we do not have to use all these centres. But we will be ready for all eventualities. 19. At this point, I must recognise the incredible work being done by our healthcare workers and volunteers across the country especially in frontline areas of Lagos and Ogun States as well as the Federal Capital Territory. 20. You are our heroes and as a nation, we will forever remain grateful for your sacrifice during this very difficult time. More measures to motivate our health care workers are being introduced which we will announce in the coming weeks. 21. As a nation, we are on the right track to win the fight against COVID-19. 22. However, I remain concerned about the increase in number of confirmed cases and deaths being reported across the world and in Nigeria specifically. 23. On 30th March 2020, when we started our lockdown in conforming with medical and scientific advice, the total number of confirmed cases across the world was over 780,000. 24. Yesterday, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally was over one million, eight hundred and fifty thousand. This figure is more than double in two weeks! READ ALSO: 25. In the last fourteen days alone, over 70,000 people have died due to this disease. 26. In the same period, we have seen the health system of even the most developed nations being overwhelmed by this virus. 27. Here in Nigeria, we had 131 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 12 States on 30th March 2020. We had two fatalities then. 28. This morning, Nigeria had 323 confirmed cases in twenty States. Unfortunately we now have ten fatalities. Lagos State remains the center and accounts for 54% of the confirmed cases in Nigeria. When combined with the FCT, the two locations represent over 71% of the confirmed cases in Nigeria. 29. Most of our efforts will continue to focus in these two locations. 30. Majority of the confirmed cases in Lagos and the FCT are individuals with recent international travel history or those that came into contact with returnees from international trips. 31. By closing our airports and land borders and putting strict conditions for seaport activities, we have reduced the impact of external factors on our country. However, the increase in the number of States with positive cases is alarming. 32. The National Centre for Disease Control has informed me that, a large proportion of new infections are now occurring in our communities, through person-to-person contacts. So we must pay attention to the danger of close contact between person to person. 33. At this point, I will remind all Nigerians to continue to take responsibility for the recommended measures to prevent transmission, including maintaining physical distancing, good personal hygiene and staying at home. 34. In addition, I have signed the Quarantine Order in this regard and additional regulations to provide clarity in respect of the control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic which will be released soon. 35. The public health response to COVID-19 is built on our ability to detect, test and admit cases as well as trace all their contacts. While I note some appreciable progress, we can achieve a lot more. 36. Today, the cessation of movement, physical distancing measures and the prohibition of mass gatherings remain the most efficient and effective way of reducing the transmission of the virus. By sustaining these measures, combined with extensive testing and contact tracing, we can take control and limit the spread of the disease. 37. Our approach to the virus remains in 2 steps – First, to protect the lives of our fellow Nigerians and residents living here and second, to preserve the livelihoods of workers and business owners. 38. With this in mind and having carefully considered the briefings and Report from the Presidential Task Force and the various options offered, it has become necessary to extend the current restriction of movement in Lagos and Ogun States as well as the FCT for another 14 days effective from 11:59 pm on Monday, 13th of April, 2020. I am therefore once again asking you all to work with Government in this fight. 39. This is not a joke. It is a matter of life and death. Mosques in Makkah and Madina have been closed. The Pope celebrated Mass on an empty St. Peter’s Square. The famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris held Easter Mass with less than 10 people. India, Italy and France are in complete lockdown. Other countries are in the process of following suit. We cannot be lax. 40. The previously issued guidelines on exempted services shall remain. 41. This is a difficult decision to take, but I am convinced that this is the right decision. The evidence is clear. 42. The repercussions of any premature end to the lockdown action are unimaginable. 43. We must not lose the gains achieved thus far. We must not allow a rapid increase in community transmission. We must endure a little longer. 44. I will therefore take this opportunity to urge you all to notify the relevant authorities if you or your loved ones develop any symptoms. I will also ask our health care professionals to redouble their efforts to identify all suspected cases, bring them into care and prevent transmission to others. 45. No country can afford the full impact of a sustained restriction of movement on its economy. I am fully aware of the great difficulties experienced especially by those who earn a daily wage such as traders, day-workers, artisans and manual workers. 46. For this group, their sustenance depends on their ability to go out. Their livelihoods depend on them mingling with others and about seeking work. But despite these realities we must not change the restrictions. 47. In the past two weeks, we announced palliative measures such as food distribution, cash transfers and loans repayment waivers to ease the pains of our restrictive policies during this difficult time. These palliatives will be sustained. 48. I have also directed that the current social register be expanded from 2.6 million households to 3.6 million households in the next two weeks. This means we will support an additional one million homes with our social investment programs. A technical committee is working on this and will submit a report to me by the end of this week. 49. The Security Agencies have risen to the challenges posed by this unprecedented situation with gallantry and I commend them. I urge them to continue to maintain utmost vigilance, firmness as well as restraint in enforcing the restriction orders while not neglecting statutory security responsibilities. 50. Fellow Nigerians, follow the instructions on social distancing. The irresponsibility of the few can lead to the death of the many. Your freedom ends where other people’s rights begin. 51. The response of our State Governors has been particularly impressive, especially in aligning their policies and actions to those of the Federal Government. 52. In the coming weeks, I want to assure you that the Federal Government, through the Presidential Task Force, will do whatever it takes to support you in this very difficult period. I have no doubt that, by working together and carefully following the rules, we shall get over this pandemic. 53. I must also thank the Legislative arm of Government for all its support and donations in this very difficult period. This collaboration is critical to the short and long-term success of all the measures that we have instituted in response to the pandemic. 54. As a result of this pandemic, the world as we know it has changed. The way we interact with each other, conduct our businesses and trade, travel, educate our children and earn our livelihoods will be different. 55. To ensure our economy adapts to this new reality, I am directing the Ministers of Industry, Trade and Investment, Communication and Digital Economy, Science and Technology, Transportation, Aviation, Interior, Health, Works and Housing, Labour and Employment and Education to jointly develop a comprehensive policy for a “Nigerian economy functioning with COVID-19”. 56. The Ministers will be supported by the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and Economic Sustainability Committee in executing this mandate. 57. I am also directing the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, the National Security Adviser, the Vice Chairman, National Food Security Council and the Chairman, Presidential Fertiliser Initiative to work with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to ensure the impact of this pandemic on our 2020 farming season is minimized. 58. Finally, I want to thank the members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for all their hard work so far. Indeed, the patriotism shown in your work is exemplary and highly commendable. 59. Fellow Nigerians, I have no doubt that by working together and carefully following the rules, we shall get over this pandemic and emerge stronger in the end. 60.

f563792d,"WOODSIDE — She was a high school dropout at 15. Then a grocery clerk, then a Harvard MBA, then a rock star high tech executive. At 37, having revolutionized the dot-com world by helping to create Amazon, she quit to lead another, more personal startup: her own life. Joy Covey often went rock climbing and kite-boarding, and undertook her greatest adventure with the birth of son Tyler eight years ago. She was 50 when she died Wednesday. Riding her bike down one of Skyline Boulevard’s treacherous hills, she collided with a van. Like so much else in Covey’s life, her death came suddenly, a shock to friends and admirers who never knew what to expect from her next. Before becoming an Internet pioneer, Covey was the restless daughter of a doctor and nurse, who were no doubt taken aback when she abruptly quit as a freshman at San Mateo High School, but not appalled. With a blazing IQ of 173 and an adventurer’s urge to try something new, instead of surrendering to boredom, she left home at 15. “I thought, ‘If I don’t obey, what can they do?’ ” Covey said in a 1999 interview with Fortune magazine, which had just named her to its list of Most Powerful Women in Business. “I decided, there’s no more following the rules.” Name some poets She passed the high school equivalency exam, then bagged groceries in Fresno for a while, graduated from Cal State-Fresno in 21/2 years, and scored second highest in the country on the exam to become a certified public accountant. A brief stint at the accounting firm Arthur Young led her to Harvard, where she earned an MBA and a law degree. She was the only member of her Harvard cohort to arrive with bragging rights over bagging both groceries and high school. “I was completely intimidated by the rest of the class,” Covey told the Harvard Law Bulletin in a 2002 interview. “Not having finished high school and having been fairly utilitarian in the way I went about college, I didn’t have a deep liberal arts background. So we’d go to lunch and people would talk about their favorite seventeenth-century poets, and I’d be thinking, ‘Could I even name five poets? From any century?’ It wasn’t until we got our first-semester grades back that I started to realize that everything was going to be OK.” Metamorphosis Amazon co-founder and CEO Jeff Bezos named the company after the Amazon River, which in turn was named after Greek mythology’s legendary nation of female warriors. That was Covey’s tribe after taking the position of chief financial officer at the fledgling online bookseller at age 33. When she joined Amazon, the company had 150 employees and annual losses that would soon grow into the hundreds of millions. She led Amazon’s IPO, counseling impatient Wall Street analysts to expect more red ink before profitability. By the time she quit to go skiing in 2000, Covey’s net worth was estimated at $200 million. Amazon now has 97,000 employees and a market capitalization of $142.6 billion, all of it based on a structure she put in place. She always insisted that she hadn’t retired, just gone through another metamorphosis. This one led her to pour energy and considerable money into the National Resources Defense Council, where she served on the board and as treasurer. In the cycling accident that killed her, the driver of the van, a 22-year-old Fremont man, had turned left in front of her from the oncoming lane at the last instant, according to CHP spokesman Arturo Montiel. He stayed at the scene and has not been cited in the incident. Montiel said the collision is still under investigation. Staff writer Joshua Melvin contributed to this report.

f85ea242,"It’s been a long time coming, but finally we have a definitive answer. JK Rowling is a TERF. There have been multiple instances wherein the (in)famous Harry Potter author demonstrated solidarity with radical feminists who have waged a vicious smear campaign against transgender women. Once, she blamed liking anti-transgender statuses on Twitter as an error, dubbing it a “Clumsy and Middle-Aged Moment.” Despite fans catching the 53 year old in the act of putting her stamp of approval on trans hate once again, she thumbed her nose at the backlash. Rowling eagerly co-signed the Anti-Trans attacks launched by notorious The Times journalist Janice Turner. Most recently, Turner led a hate-motivated campaign against UK children’s charity National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children who had enlisted transgender model Munroe Bergdorf in a partnership to expand efforts to reach vulnerable LGBT children. Turner took to twitter where she accused Bergdorf of being a “porn model” and encouraged supporters to consider suspending direct debit donations to the charity. While the LGBT community and our allies have stood back and watched a rather ominous narrative form around JK Rowling, it has been without any direct confirmation or statement from the author herself. It’s as if she is conditioning the world to accept it rather than rebuke it. First she stuck her toe in the water, was caught, claimed it was a misunderstanding and we accepted that. Then, she persisted to do the same things… again and again. Finally, we have some confirmation of Rowling’s stance against the transgender community. She has followed one of the most hateful and aggressive anti-trans radical feminists on Twitter, Magdalen Berns. Out of her 14 million followers, Rowling herself follows less than 700 people on social media, so it’s safe to presume her perspective aligns with that of the well known transphobe whose account is solely committed to espousing misinformation and dangerous rhetoric toward transgender women. This clearly isn’t another middle-aged moment. Instead, it seems more like Rowling unapologetically pulling back the curtain and finally ending what little left there was to speculate about with any optimism. Twitter has postured itself as something of a safe-house for TERFs. You don’t have to deep-dive to see those leaders of the anti-trans movement all follow each other and retweet each other’s journalistic hit pieces and clever jibes that attack trans identities. Graham Linehan, Posie Parker, Janice Turner, Julie Bindel, Women Place UK, Mumsnet and Magdalen all present themselves as soldiers on the frontline in their war on transgender women. Some dedicate their efforts to harassing and bullying transwomen on the platform while others actually tour the country to proselytize to other women and recruit them into their radical ideologies. Twitter did permanently ban radfem warrior Meghan Murphy who was constantly attacking transgender women, misgendering them, deadnaming them and dog whistling her fellow radicals to join her in the targeted take-down-of-the-day. She treated hunting us as a sport on Twitter. She thinks hate speech is an exercise of free speech, yet forgets that hate has consequences. This group coordinates their efforts to damage trans people. They provoke violence against the trans community. They spread malignant lies to spark fear and breed intolerance. The time they invest in this is alarming. However, it still took years to finally allow Murphy enough rope to get herself banned. Twitter typically takes a passive stance on TERF’s and have even banned trans women for defending themselves against members of this very group of radicals. To see JK Rowling lock arms with this form of hatred, targeting a minority community while having the ear of millions of young children is deeply saddening. An enormous demographic of her audience is LGBT; Kids who identified with fighting forces of evil for their right to exist, their right to equality, their access to opportunity. Now, an entire generation of adults who used the Harry Potter books to navigate the rough terrain of life’s trials and tribulations must reckon with the fact that their literary darling is not the progressive fighter for social justice she pretended to be. In fact, many transgender fans are having to reconcile that she’s lending her support to those who wish to fight them back into silence instead.",JK Rowling Confirms Stance Against Transgender Women,TRUE

6d16fa40,"By Ken Allen AFSCME Council 75 represents the workers in the vast majority of the state corrections facilities in Oregon. Our members work hard to protect the public, while working with inmates incarcerated in 13 prisons throughout the state. While the majority of our members are corrections officers, we also represent counselors, dentists, food service workers, nurses, maintenance and clerical workers, among others. These jobs are tough, stressful and sometimes dangerous. The Oregon Legislature and governor are currently considering how to close a $340 million budget hole because tax revenues are less than expected when forecast last May. Part of a budget deal announced on the first day of this year's legislative session would close the Santiam Correctional Institution southeast of Salem. The estimated savings after closure in June would be $1.6 million. The governor and the Legislature should reconsider this plan. The closure plan and the numbers don't add up. The closure is a knee-jerk reaction to a real budget problem. The Santiam Correctional Institution holds 440 inmates. It is a minimum-security facility. Typically, minimum-security facilities are the cheapest to operate, followed by medium-security, with maximum-security facilities at the highest cost per inmate. The legislative plan is to release none of the 440 inmates, but ship them to other prisons throughout Oregon. Under the current plan, 50 percent of these minimum-security inmates would be then imprisoned in a higher-cost medium-security facility. All the 440 inmates would be pushed into an already overcrowded prison system. We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor. We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates. The plan to send 440 more inmates into an overcrowded system would create dangerous and hazardous work for our members and the inmates. Prison overcrowding leads to assaults on staff and other inmates and to lawsuits. The Department of Corrections believes it would have to reopen the facility 12 to 18 months later because of inmate population growth. The leadership of this union is opposed to the closure of the Santiam facility. Department leadership has asked legislators to let them find the $1.6 million of cuts in the budget of the whole department. Legislators should do their jobs to monitor budget needs, but none of them has ever even run a prison. Let the managers and workers at the Department of Corrections put together a plan to save $1.6 million. Don't close the Santiam Correctional Institution.

This is a virus that, without adequate restrictions in place, spreads with ferocity. Case rates are increasing again, hospital admissions are climbing again. R is edging up again. “Last week the England wide rate was 159 per 100,000. Now its 188 per 100,000. That’s a 20 per cent increase. Across London cases have increased 30 per cent in a week, the East of England 36 per cent. “None of us are surprised at the action he is taking today. Indeed he was warned that Tier 2 wouldn’t be enough to contain the spread of this virus. Now it looks like in some areas, such as Kent, Tier 3 isn’t enough to contain the spread either. “Elsewhere in the country Tier 3 areas appears to be broadly flat lining, with some like North West trending down. But overall the increasing areas are rising faster than the decreasing areas are falling. “As things stand, we are heading into the Christmas easing with diminishing headroom. The buffer zone these tiers were supposed to provide is getting much thinner. “So what is his plan to keep people safe through Christmas and to avoid huge pressures in the NHS in January? What is his plan to support an exhausted, understaffed NHS through January to deliver the care patients will need? And is he confident that our NHS won’t be so overwhelmed in January that it impacts the vaccination programme? “Our response to Covid-19 could have been stronger had Serco’s contact tracing not left a gaping hole in our defences. In boroughs like Islington only 65 per cent of contacts were traced by the national system. In Tower Hamlets only 60 per cent; In Barking 61 per cent. “Test and Trace is costing £22 billion – more than the policing and fire service combined – and yet according to the NAO, up to September only £785 million was allocated to local council public health teams. “Serco have subcontracted to 21 other firms offering little training to staff, with some in call centres alongside others making sales calls for gambling websites. It’s time to scrap Serco, and put all public health teams in the lead doing the retrospective cluster busting contact tracing we need. “He has promised more testing for Tier 3 areas, what about Tier 2 areas? On Lateral Flow Tests some care home providers refused to use them due to concerns about their accuracy, is he satisfied these tests are accurate enough for this purpose and are safe? And if they can’t be used for care homes how quickly can care home residents’ relatives makes use of PCR tests? “He often praises Liverpool. But isn’t the biggest lesson to draw from Liverpool that people still struggle to isolate if they haven’t got the financial means to do so? “The eligibility criteria for the £500 payment is too tightly drawn. People need decent sick pay. People in some circumstances need alternative accommodation. People need help with shopping and medicines. Surely some of the £22 billion spent on Test and Trace could be reallocated to offer people isolation support? “On the mutation in the virus identified, our constituents will be naturally concerned – will he keep the house updated on this? “Finally, today I spoke to Fred Banning. Fred is just 38. He has two children under 10. His cancer is terminal. He asks that those with terminal illness and given quicker access to the vaccine, so he can – in his words to me – “make the most of the time he has left with his family’.

11aea5b0,"By Jim Francesconi As we pass the governance torch from the State Board of Higher Education to independent boards at the University of Oregon, Portland State University and Oregon State University, we will be navigating a future of heightened risks and rewards. The rewards lie in the private sector reinforcements that are coming to the aid of our three major research universities. The caliber of some board nominees are similar to those found at Stanford, Yale, Harvard and other prestigious private universities. Major Oregon CEOs and entrepreneurs have volunteered to use their power, influence and resources to benefit Oregon's public universities. Oregon is a small state with limited public resources, great needs and high aspirations. Although our universities have a few of the nation's best programs, we are not living up to our potential. That is what happens when state funding for becomes mired near the bottom of all states for more than 20 years. Now there is the promise to leverage private resources for this vital public purpose. But there are risks as well. We need high-quality engineering and other research programs, but we cannot afford them at every campus. Portland needs to be served, with PSU in charge, but so does every part of our state. Our small schools should be strengthened, not sacrificed. Sports are important, but not the highest priority. As vital as universities are, they are means to public ends, not ends in and of themselves. Oregon needs a vibrant, innovative economy. Our universities can create more research collaboratives such as ONAMI (Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute) and the Portland Life Sciences center, which attract world-class talent and create jobs. Next up ... the Light Metals Institute sponsored by Oregon and Washington universities and the Manufacturing 21 business coalition. Oregon's per capita income is almost 10 percent below the national average. Universities can prepare more Oregonians for well-paid jobs in health care, STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), advanced manufacturing and professional-technical careers. And we should take advantage of the growing demographic and political strength of the Latino community by working together to provide access to college and to family-wage jobs. Above all, Oregon must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000. As a result, fewer Oregonians are going to college. Like many, my grandparents and parents sacrificed so that I could be the first in my family to go to college. For the first time in Oregon's history, my generation is better educated than the generation that is now college age. New university board members can raise scholarship funds so that more Oregonians can graduate from UO, PSU and OSU. But these board members should also help increase philanthropy at Southern, Western, Eastern and the Oregon Institute of Technology. All Oregonians from every part of the state should have a chance to achieve their potential and contribute to our state. Finally, we must understand that philanthropy alone cannot produce excellent universities with innovative research, quality instruction and access for all Oregonians. The Legislature has consistently balanced the budget on the backs of students, forcing tuition increases. New board members have the power to reverse this practice and to force major public investments in our universities for the good of Oregon. Let us work together to apply that power to building an affordable and accessible world-class university system.

Instead, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year. PROMISE MADE: Trump promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump in Pennsylvania: “We’re going to bring back our manufacturing, we’re going to bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a whole.” [Valley Forge PA, 11/1/16] Trump in Wisconsin: “I just had this written out and this is about Wisconsin trade facts. Twenty percent of manufacturing jobs have left since 2000. Nobody knows that. We’ll get you a job. We’ll get you a lot of jobs. We’re bringing our jobs back from China. We’re bringing out jobs back from Mexico. We’re going to stop people from moving to Mexico.” [Racine WI, 4/2/16] PROMISE BROKEN: Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year. Bloomberg: “The two swing states lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past 12 months, bucking the national trend.

c57f8234,"People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed. As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition. They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme. Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&E, the report says. More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early. Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year. “People diagnosed in A&E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group. It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London. GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed. However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.” Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people. NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester 56.1% and Leeds south and east 54%. More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland. In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire 15.7% and Harrogate 16%. Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&E. Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks. The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.” Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added. NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival.","A team of scientists from Canada have identified at least 13 strains of cannabis sativa they believe can aid in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The President of the United States of America has spent the past few weeks touting a dangerous drug called hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic treatment for COVID-19. Unfortunately, the president’s expertise is in reality TV, not medicine. Several studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine, a drug designed to treat malaria, has dangerous side-effects when used to treat coronavirus, including death. The quest for a COVID-19 drug that will both make Donald Trump and his friends in the pharmaceutical industry rich and not kill the people who take it has, so far, netted no results. But exciting government-sponsored research out of Canada seems to indicate a different approach is in order. Per the team’s research paper: “ We have developed over 800 new Cannabis sativa lines and extracts and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to modulate ACE2 expression in COVID-19 target tissues. Screening C. sativa extracts using artificial human 3D models of oral, airway, and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high CBD C. sativa extracts that modulate ACE2 gene expression and ACE2 protein levels. Our initial data suggest that some C. sativa extract down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV2 entry into host cells. What this means is the team has carefully developed several cannabis strains that have been experimentally shown to make it significantly more difficult for the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus to find a home inside of the tissue cells it latches onto in order to infect us with the COVID-19 disease. It does not mean you should run out to your local dispensary and exhaust their sativa and CBD supply. The 13 strains cultivated by the researchers are almost certainly very different from whatever wacky-named strains you’re going to purchase over the counter. But, if you must take an untested treatment, I recommend taking Canada‘s lead and legally imbibing cannabis instead of listening to the Trump administration. A recent study led by Harvard Medical School professor Mandeep Mehra which looked at data from more than 96,000 COVID-19 patients, 15,000 of which had been treated with hydroxychloroquine, clearly showed that patients using the drug were at far greater risk for death than those who did not. Per a report from the Washington Post: “ For those given hydroxychloroquine, there was a 34 percent increase in risk of mortality and a 137 percent increased risk of a serious heart arrhythmias. For those receiving hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic — the cocktail endorsed by Trump — there was a 45 percent increased risk of death and a 411 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Those given chloroquine had a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 256 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. For those taking chloroquine and an antibiotic, there was a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 301 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Donald Trump recently told reporters and the US public that he’d been taking hydroxycholoroquine as a preventative measure to ward off COVID-19. Excepting the fact he has a small financial stake in Plaquenil – the drug name for hydroxycholoroquine — if he really wants to prevent COVID-19 he should imbibe cannabis. There’s no peer-reviewed evidence showing it’ll work, but at least it won’t kill him. Not only has no one ever died from imbibing cannabis, it has clear medical benefits for the prevention and treatment of diseases ranging from viral infections to cancer. That, and he might be less of an asshole if he smoked a joint every now and again. For more information on the cannabis study, check out the full pre-print research paper here. And if you want to know more about why nobody should use hydroxycholorquine to prevent or treat COVID-19, please read this important study.",FALSE
7d66cb3b,"Justine Greening resigned from the government on Monday after Theresa May tried to move her from her post as secretary of state for education to the Department for Work and Pensions in a cabinet reshuffle designed to reboot her government. In a statement May said said she was “disappointed” but respected Greening’s decision. Greening was succeeded as education secretary by Damian Hinds, who was promoted from being a junior work and pensions minister. Earlier May kept Jeremy Hunt as her health secretary with new responsibility for social care, signalling that the prime minister wants to make another attempt to reform the troubled system. Hunt was rumoured to be moving to a new role as May’s deputy but will stay in his job to address the worsening winter crisis in the NHS and take more control over social care. The deputy job has now been given to David Lidington, who moves from the role of justice secretary and will take over as minister for the Cabinet Office, chairing the big cabinet committees and standing in for May at prime minister’s questions. Hunt’s new remit is a sign that May wants to return to the difficult issue of social care, after abandoning a deeply unpopular election policy to make people pay for elderly care out of the value of their property. Labour branded the policy a “dementia tax” and it was swiftly dropped after the election. Two other cabinet ministers who were said to be facing the chop, Sajid Javid and Greg Clark, have also kept their jobs in the reshuffle. Javid’s role has been changed from communities and local government to housing, communities and local government, part of May’s attempts to focus more attention on housing issues. Clark’s job as secretary of state for business, energy and industrial policy stays the same. Earlier, the shake-up got off to a chaotic start after an official Conservative party Twitter account announced that Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, was the new party chair, even though it was in fact Brandon Lewis who had been given the role. No 10 also announced that Amber Rudd would remain as home secretary, Philip Hammond as chancellor and David Davis as Brexit secretary. Boris Johnson was also confirmed in his job as foreign secretary, shortly after he was seen going into Downing Street. Gavin Williamson will remain at defence. Karen Bradley became Northern Ireland secretary after James Brokenshire said he would be leaving his post for health reasons. A No 10 announcement said Lidington, who was also formerly leader of the Commons and is a generally popular figure among Tory MPs, had been made minister for the Cabinet Office and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. David Gauke was sent to the justice department to fill the space left by Lidington, after just six months in the role of the work and pensions secretary. Gauke, a former solicitor, is now the sixth justice secretary to fill the role since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. While Downing Street confirmed that his new role remained a cabinet post, Lidington has not been made first secretary of state, the courtesy title that gave Green the job of May’s de facto deputy. Green was sacked in December after an investigation found he had lied about the discovery of pornography on his office computer during a police raid in 2008. However, No 10 said Lidington would chair all the influential Cabinet Office committees formerly chaired by Green, meaning he has in effect the same job, but without the first secretary of state title. Following the first confirmed move of the day – Brokenshire’s resignation – several reports said Grayling was being moved from being transport secretary to party chairman. This appeared confirmed after the official Conservative Twitter account sent a photo of Grayling with the message: “Congratulations to Chris Grayling following his appointment as Conservative party chairman.” However, this message was very quickly deleted, as reports began circulating that Lewis might get the post instead. BBC confirming Grayling appointment but advisers saying its speculation and he hasn't been to no10 yet. The Conservatives had tweeted a congrats, though its now disappeared. What is going on!? pic.twitter.com/8GDc0RE4kS — Anushka Asthana (@GuardianAnushka) January 8, 2018 About an hour later came the announcement from Downing Street that Lewis was leaving the Home Office to become minister without portfolio and chair of the party. It had been confirmed earlier that the incumbent party chairman, Sir Patrick McLoughlin, had stood down. He had been under pressure since the disastrous election campaign and an incident when a prankster got into the party conference to hand May a fake P45 during her main speech. Earlier, it was announced that Brokenshire would leave. The long-time ally of May has been unable to resurrect the suspended Northern Ireland assembly following a political collapse after a scandal over a botched green heating subsidy scheme. In an exchange of letters released by No 10, Brokenshire told May he had a small lesion on his right lung that would require surgery. Brokenshire wrote that he had hoped to continue in the job: “I recognise, however, that as a result of my forthcoming surgery I will not be able to give the effort, energy and complete focus needed at this important time if we are to secure the positive outcomes both you and I are committed to achieving.” May wrote back to say she was “sorry to hear about your medical situation” and accepted his resignation. James Brokenshire. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images James Cleverly, the MP for Braintree, elected in 2015, has been appointed as the Tory party’s deputy chair, the party’s media account tweeted. It also said Chris Skidmore, the constitution minister, had been named vice-chair for policy, with Ben Bradley and Kemi Badenoch – who both entered parliament in June – made vice-chairs for youth and candidates respectively. Bradley is 27. Maria Caulfield was named vice-chair for women. The wholesale revamp of Conservative party operations, widely expected ahead of the reshuffle, gave vice-chair roles to a series of other MPs: Rehman Chishti and Helen Grant for communities; Andrew Jones for business engagement; Marcus Jones for local government; and James Morris for training. The appointments marked a demotion for Skidmore, Andrew Jones and Marcus Jones, all of whom have lost ministerial jobs with the move. Skidmore has left the Cabinet Office, while Andrew Jones was a junior Treasury minister and Marcus Jones has gone from being local government minister to the unpaid job of party vice-chair for the same area.","CLARKSBURG — When Jared Henry and Maddie Mansell saw the business property available along Buckhannon Pike in Nutter Fort, they knew just what the community needed there. The building sits right across the street from a park — the perfect location for a coffee and ice cream shop, said Mansell, who now manages Black and White Coffee and Ice Cream in that space. “He always wanted to open a coffee shop and so did I,” she said. Like many small business owners, Henry and Mansell identified a need in the community and took a risk to try to fill it. The addition to the community benefits kids and parents in the area, Mansell said. “It draws everybody in. It gives the teenagers, the kids and families a place where they’re welcome,” she said. Small businesses are the “lifeblood of communities,” according to Nikki Bowmar, public affairs specialist for the West Virginia District Office of the U.S. Small Business Administration. “Small business owners take a risk on an idea, invest in their communities and create jobs,” Bowmar said. “Their skills and creativity not only support their own families, they make neighborhoods vibrant places to live and work and fuel economic strength and growth in the state and across the nation.” There are approximately 114,391 small businesses in West Virginia. Cumulatively, these businesses make up 99 percent of the total number of businesses in the state and employ 280,213 people — nearly 50 percent of the state’s workforce, according to Bowmar. While Mansell does not own the business, she has found employment at small businesses much of her life. As a young teen, her family sold soaps created with supplies from their farm. They later opened a restaurant, she said. For her, though, small businesses provide more than just a job. They allow connections with customers that are not as often cultivated in larger businesses, she said. “What we value, first and foremost, is our customers and people who walk into the door,” she said. “We see them as more than just customers. … We want them to feel like a part of the family, and build friendships, and show them the love we have received in Christ.” Small businesses can also serve as staples within the community, according to George “Gib” Brown, president and general manager of The James and Law Co. James and Law, which sells office furniture and supplies, serves as the textbook depository for West Virginia schools and employs nearly 30 people, has been a fixture in downtown Clarksburg since it formed with the merger of two companies in 1903, Brown said. James and Law is different from other small businesses in that it is a shareholder-held company. People in small businesses have an interest in ensuring their communities are healthy, Brown said. “I see us as kind of a constant. Our officers throughout the years have been involved in the Chamber, the local service agencies, the local church communities. The current officers do the same thing. It’s just a part of the DNA of this company. The company and its employees and officers are integral parts of the community,” he said. The business has also been involved in community development, including helping to provide furniture for the Robinson Grand Performing Arts Center in downtown Clarksburg. “We were really happy to be a part of something like that that we think will bring value to businesses and industry and quality of life in Clarksburg for years to come,” Brown said. Small businesses allow rural communities to be self-reliant and draw upon the resources that are already in the community, including its people, said Dan Taylor, coordinator of the West Virginia Community Development Hub’s Energizing Entrepreneurial Communities program.  The program, in the last of three years, helps four communities, including Grafton, create improved support systems for small business entrepreneurs. Small businesses are a means to economic growth that draws on resources, including the people, that are already in the community, Taylor said. A vibrant and diverse small business community means an area is less reliant on outside forces for providing economic opportunity, he said. “A lot of communities in the state have went through some serious population loss, and I think creating our own small business opportunities is a strategy that will stabilize the population and create employment. It’s also good for the tax base for a community. The more businesses you have, especially local businesses that are paying back into that tax base, will allow a community to be able to fund the infrastructure and the schools that they need. It’s just positive,” Taylor said. They can also draw new residents and tourists, he said. “If you want people to visit the community, you’ve got to have services there — things for people to be able to do, to see, to buy, to eat,” he said. Small business owners take on big risks to invest in their communities. Stephen Mann and his family never had ambitions to be small business owners, but saw it as something that could pull people into Lewis County, spreading the potential benefits beyond themselves and to other businesses in the area. Small businesses also hire people locally, rather than pulling in temporary workers from out of state, he said. In December, he and his family opened MannCave Distilling in Weston. In Mann’s case, it took mortgages on two homes, a substantial loan, most of his savings and one of his 401k accounts to open the distillery serving whiskey, moonshine and vodka. “We’re still not at capacity where it’s paying for itself yet, so it’s still a risk,” Mann said. The Manns do not live in Lewis County, but hope to move to the area once the business takes off, he said. “The reason I chose this particular business is because I will be pulling income from outside of the county into the county and, eventually, outside of the state into the county,” Mann said. “I’m going to be spending a lot of money in Lewis County from what I make.” Small business owners in rural areas like West Virginia face unique challenges. “Another issue rural areas have is finding access to capital to support investments in entrepreneurship, innovation and growth. It can be more daunting in rural areas where there are fewer alternatives to conventional bank loans, relative to urban areas, which have easier access to venture capital, angel investing and emerging crowdsourcing models,” Bowmar said. Mann said he would like to see more state and county support for new small businesses. Development of roads, less regulation of signage and decreased paperwork would help small business owners immensely, he said. Many are working to try to create an environment where small business can thrive. The Energizing Entrepreneurial Communities program leaders in Grafton have worked on downtown beautification projects, planned festivals and encouraged the arts, downtown revitalization and development of outdoor recreation opportunities that can help attract people into the town, Taylor said. A grassroots community effort called All Aboard Grafton is also stepping up to the plate and continuing that work, Taylor said. Taylor County was first in the state in percentage growth of new businesses in February, a sign that efforts are working, according to Patricia Henderson, executive director of the Taylor County Development Authority and administrative support to the Taylor County Commission. “People are wanting to see growth in Taylor County. Young people are willing to work hard and step out in faith that people will support local businesses,” she said. In Weston, a Fairs and Festivals Committee has planned events to support small businesses, according to Mayor Julia Spelsberg. Christmastime is especially busy, when the committee organizes promotions to encourage people to stop into the area’s small stores, she said. “We know all too well the importance of small businesses,” Spelsberg said. “So much of our economy is run on small businesses. In Weston, there’s a ton of small businesses, especially downtown. Small businesses are your family and friends and it’s really important to support them.” Similar efforts are taking place in communities across North Central West Virginia. The Small Business Administration is also trying to help, Bowmar said. The organization “has partnered with USDA to promote rural development, elevate quality of life in rural communities, and ensure small businesses in rural areas benefit from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, the Historically Underutilized Business Zones and Opportunity Zones programs,” she said. They can also help provide small business owners with capital and technical assistance, she said. “A really important thing that we’ve seen is just sort of changing the narrative about our small towns in the state,” Taylor said. “It’s often a very depressing view we have … and we really want to turn that around and show there’s really a lot of opportunity and we can make our small towns thriving places again. We should celebrate the work that’s happening to do that.”",TRUE
9f89b2ba,"The nosediving security situation in the country is increasingly putting President Muhammadu Buhari under pressure as prominent Nigerians, among whom are governors, former political office holders, clerics and Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, have started to speak out in condemnation of his alleged inaction. The past two weeks have particularly been traumatic for the country, with killings, abductions and attacks on communities and security agencies, especially as killing of police officers continues unabated. Within the period, bandits operating in Kaduna State invaded a private institution in the State, Greenfield University in Chikun Local Government Area, abducted more than 20 students and killed a staff during the attack. In a gruesome move, the bandits, who asked for N800 million ransom, have killed five of the students to show that they meant business. During the period also, scores of innocent Nigerians were killed in Zamfara State as Boko Haram attempted to take over Geidam in Yobe State and Mainok in Borno State, with the Nigerian military fighting desperately to retake them, albeit at a cost, as some men and officers were lost during the battle. Not done, bandits also attacked and abducted students of the Federal University of Agriculture, Markurdi, the Benue State capital, early in the week. Nothing has been heard about the fate of the students. This is apart from a revelation from the Governor of the State, Samuel Ortom that about 70 residents of the state have been killed in two weeks. The situation in Niger State is fast becoming hopeless, as two LGAs, Munya and Shiroro, have practically become bandits’ killing fields. This was before a shocking revelation by the state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello that Boko Haram insurgents have infiltrated the state, hoisting their flag in Kaure in Munya LGA, an indication that they have declared a caliphate in the area. Also down South, the situation in the South-East geopolitical zone is increasing calling for concerns, as no day passes without reports of attacks on the police formations and personnel. What makes the South-East situation more alarming is that the operation of ‘gunmen’ in the zone have mainly focused on security agents, in what reminds Nigerians about the formative days of the Boko Haram insurgency. This has no doubt raised comcerns in several circles of an evolving insurgency in Igboland, a situation many believe Nigeria may not be able to cope with, especially with the current insurgency in North-East and banditry in the North-West and North Central. Realising that the security situation in the country was practically spiralling out of control, prominent Nigerians decided to speak out, putting further pressure on the Buhari administration, which many Nigerians said has proven unable to proffer solution to the hydra headed security challenges in the country. In a rather frustrated outburst, Nasir el-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State, who has constantly shown his disgust for the bandits operating in his state, pointedly declared that what the bandits and other criminal elements terrorising the country deserve is deaths. He said, “kill them all”. According to him, no one staying in the forests is innocent and what they deserve is death, opening a floodgate of intervention, angry outbursts and advice from prominent Nigerians. Respected Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, shortly after the killing of three of the abducted students of Greenfield University, pointedly told President Buhari to swallow his pride and seek for help! “Seek Help. Stop Improvising with Human Lives. Youth – that is, the future – should not serve as ritual offering on the altar of a failing State”, he said in a statement on Saturday. According to Soyinka, Nigeria is at war but the government continues to pretend that “these are mere birth-pangs of a glorious entity”. He however, said the current situation in the country suggests death throes, adding, “Vultures and undertakers hover patiently but with full confidence.” “The dogs of war stopped merely baying years ago. Again and again, they have sunk their fangs into the jugular of this nation. The plague called COVID has met its match on the earth of some nation space once known as Nigeria”, Soyinka painted a scary picture of the Nigerian situation. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), perhaps to show that it is a party with a soul, admitted, albeit for the first time that insecurity is real in the country. Before admitting what other Nigerians have always known in a statement by its National Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the APC had always beaten its chest that the Buhari administration has improved security in the country tremendously since coming into office in 2015. They also claimed that the security situation in the country had improved from what it used to be under the Goodluck Jonathan administration that ended on May 29, 2015. However, the party said: “The issue of insecurity in the country has found expression in terrorist and criminal activities of Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers, rustlers and recently the highly condemnable attacks on security formations in some states. “These are current realities and the APC will not playing politics with matters of life and our collective wellbeing as a nation.” For many Nigerians, the admittance by the ruling party that all is not well with the country, may after all spur the government of the nation into action. This is because of the belief that the party and the country has always lived in denial of the actual situation in the country. Majority of Nigerians who watched the viral video of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello talking about the situation in his state cut a pitiable sight of a man who is frustrated, not just for his inability to secure his people but also knowing that a greater evil, Boko Haram has taken residence right in his backyard. The Governor, in the video, while he went visiting about 3000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) taking refugee at a school in Minna, the state capital, said that Boko Haram insurgents are already in the state. He said: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements in Niger State, around Kaure. “I just heard that they’ve already hoisted their flag in Kaure, which means they’ve taken over the territory and this is what I have been engaging the FG with, and unfortunately it has now gotten to this stage that if care is not taken, not even Abuja is safe. “They’ve taken over the territory, they’ve installed their flag. I am confirming that now. They’ve taken over the wives of people by force. “Boko Haram elements are trying to use these areas as their home just like they did in Sambisa.” In what seems like a double speak, Governor Bello said: “I have not lost hope from the federal government but I am not waiting for anyone anymore.” DAILY POST recalls that Niger State has had history with the Boko Haram insurgency, as the state was at a time used as a launching pad for attempted incursions into Abuja in the hey days of the group. Joining his voice to calls by the Buhari administration to seek for help in tackling the declining security situation in the country, the Immediate-past Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Tuesday, said the President needs help and he must seek for one. Saraki, who said it was obvious that Buhari was already overwhelmed, said the situation “cannot continue” and “cannot become Nigeria’s new normal”. He said: “It is obvious that President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress government need help. They have been overwhelmed by the situation and they sure need assistance from all. Thus, I urge Mr. President to seek help wherever it can be given. This matter has gone beyond what the government can handle alone. The President should know that calling for help in our present situation is not a sign of weakness.” According to Saraki, President Buhari needs to bring together all former Presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand. “The meeting must hold expeditiously and must be followed by immediate actions. I know there are many people who believe that the fact that this suggestion is coming from a source outside government is a good reason for the President to ignore it. I think the attitude this time around must be different. This is definitely not a time for partisanship or for people to play politics with the lives of the citizenry and the future of the country. “I appeal to Mr. President to take the bull by the horn. He should act to stem the tide of this violence threatening to tear the country apart,” he added. Following in the footsteps of Saraki, his former deputy at the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, also on Tuesday, called on the Federal Government to seek foreign help to fight insecurity in the country. Ekweremadu made the call while contributing to a motion moved during plenary by Senator Sani Musa on the activities of bandits and Boko Haram terrorists in Shiroro and Rafi Local Government Areas of Niger State. According to Senator Ekweremadu, any government that fails to protect its citizens has lost its legitimacy, therefore, the Federal Government should not be ashamed to seek foreign support, while also calling for a shutdown of Niger to enable security agencies to deal with the problem. On his part, a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar warned that there is looming darkness over the country, if the attacks on schools and abduction of students continue. Calling for a 24-hour arms guard in schools, Atiku opined that if the current situation persists, school enrollment will further decline. He said in a statement: “The abduction of yet an unspecific number of undergraduates of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State, is one abduction too many. It marks both an unacceptable escalation and an expansion of this menace, and we must not only ensure that the abducted youths are rescued, but even more importantly, we must put in measures to prevent future reoccurrences. “This must not be allowed to become our new normal. It is time for us as a nation to face the reality that we have an emergency on our hands. A catastrophe that must be decisively dealt with before it snowballs into an existential crisis. “We must stop treating these acts of criminality with kid gloves. Enough is enough! There must be safety of lives and property in our citadels of learning, because without it, there would be loss of confidence in the sector, which will result in low enrolment rates in a country that is amongst the highest statistically for out-of-school children. “I renew the call I made on Monday, March 15, 2021, for a state of emergency to be declared on the education sector, and for 24 hour armed guards to be posted at all schools in the affected states. “Yes, it is an expensive venture. Nevertheless, we must accept that whatever we invest in preserving the lives of Nigerian youths is worth the price, as nothing is, or can be more valuable to us than our youths, who will take up the baton after we are gone.” To put the icing on the cake, the usually blunt Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday accused President Muhammadu Buhari of working for Fulanis to take over Nigeria. The Governor said: “What is happening now, to me, is very clear; Mr President is just working for these Fulanis to take over the whole country. “His body language is what is being played out. The body language, the action and inaction of Mr President shows that he is only the President of Fulani people; I have known this. “We are becoming a Banana Republic.

d2e759ba,"Three in four labour wards have no consultants overnight. A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. And just two out of 165 maternity units had a consultant present round the clock, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Scroll down for video A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. Stock image Mothers-to-be are instead left in the hands of overstretched midwives and inexperienced and often exhausted junior doctors. Although consultants are on call from home, they can live up to 30 minutes away and staff summon them only in emergencies. More than half of births take place out of hours. And research shows that babies born then are a third more likely to die or suffer serious complications. The royal college obtained the figures from 165 NHS maternity units – 82 per cent of the total. They show that: Just over 73 per cent had no consultants on the weekday overnight shift, typically 10pm to 8am; Another 43 per cent said none were on site at weekends; 89 per cent said consultants were not present for evening shifts at weekends; Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham and Central Manchester University were the only centres with consultants day and night, all week. Maureen Treadwell, of the Birth Trauma Association, said: ‘We are concerned at the number of hospital trusts with no consultant cover at night. ‘There are a number of rare but sudden catastrophic events in labour where a less experienced doctor may need the advice or assistance of a senior colleague. ‘These are not common events, but every year some women and babies will die as a result of substandard care, often from staff who are doing their best, but may never have dealt with such a condition.’ The figures are worrying because labours are becoming more complex due to obesity and the trend for women to have babies later in life. Experts say midwives and junior doctors are less likely to spot when things go wrong and can be reluctant to summon the help of consultants. Labour wards are also under pressure because of high birth rates fuelled by migration. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said it shows that the Tories can;t even deliver a five-day NHS Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is crucial that maternity units are sufficiently staffed to provide a high level of care to all who use them – day or night. ‘The Tories talk about a seven-day NHS but these figures show they can’t even deliver a five-day NHS.’ Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘Women need safe maternity services whenever they give birth. We know more needs to be done to provide the right level of staff to give support when necessary.’ The royal college issued recommendations in 2009 stating that maternity units should work toward having consultants present round the clock. This would improve the care of women and the training of junior staff, the guidelines stated. Consultants are supposed to supervise the care of all patients in maternity units and intervene if something goes wrong. A major study by Imperial College London last year found that babies delivered at the weekend were 7 per cent more likely to be stillborn. And research published by Cambridge University in 2010 found that babies born overnight or at weekends in Scottish hospitals were a third more likely to die. MY BABY WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I'D HAD HER IN THE WEEK Angela Owens pictured with baby Hope believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday Angela Owens believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday. She was two weeks overdue when she felt severe and sudden pain on a Saturday afternoon four days before Christmas 2013. The 31-year-old went to the labour ward at Warrington Hospital, describing it as a ghost town. Midwives repeatedly told her to go home and take paracetamol – and ignored her pleas for a consultant. Eventually – after her GP brother arrived – they bleeped the consultant but by this stage it was too late. When Ella was finally delivered on 11pm on the Saturday she was stillborn. The mother, who has two other daughters with her partner Paul, said: ‘There was a general flippant attitude towards me,’ ‘You put your trust in health staff in these situations, but I had to beg them for help. ‘Hospitals seem to go into sleep mode at the weekends and for us this resulted in the ultimate tragedy. It was horrendous. I will never recover from her death.’ Ella was one of ten babies who had been stillborn or died in unexplained circumstances at Warrington Hospital in a 12-month period between 2013/14. The deaths were avoidable and blamed on staffing shortages – half occurred at weekends. Advertisement The authors said the same would be true for English hospitals. They blamed the extra risks on a lack of intervention by junior doctors. NHS figures show that doctors performed almost 40 per cent of births in 2014/15 and midwives do most of the remainder. They do not state whether the former were consultants or junior doctors. But the figure has steadily increased from 24 per cent in 1989. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Having a baby is now safer than it has ever been and the vast majority of mothers report that they get great NHS maternity care.’ The spokesman highlighted a study last year that claimed there was no evidence to show overnight consultants made any difference to safety. But he refused to acknowledge other research showing babies born out of hours were more likely to die. Tomorrow the NHS will publish its first-ever Ofsted-style ratings for maternity care in a bid to drive up standards.","In essence, the larger question being asked is: can people without coronavirus symptoms spread the COVID-19 virus?  This question is at the heart of all current COVID mitigation efforts.  If there is no asymptomatic spread then what is all of this mask wearing nonsense and shut-down mandates all about? A research paper published on November 20th highlights a case study of almost 10 million people in China.  What the study found was there were 300 cases of Coronavirus in the population being carried without any symptoms at all.  So the scientists then tracked the asymptomatic carriers.  The contact tracing of 1,174 “close contacts” with the asymptomatic carriers showed ZERO transmission.  Not a few, not a couple, but zero -none-  not a single transmission of Coronavirus from a person without symptoms. The conclusion is not that asymptomatic spread is rare or that the science is uncertain. The study revealed something that hardly ever happens in these kinds of studies. There was not one documented case. Forget rare. Forget even Fauci’s previous suggestion that asymptomatic transmission exists but not does drive the spread. Replace all that with: never. At least not in this study for 10,000,000. [STUDY] … Stringent COVID-19 control measures were imposed in Wuhan between January 23 and April 8, 2020. Estimates of the prevalence of infection following the release of restrictions could inform post-lockdown pandemic management. Here, we describe a city-wide SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening programme between May 14 and June 1, 2020 in Wuhan. All city residents aged six years or older were eligible and 9,899,828 (92.9%) participated. No new symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI 0.270–0.339/10,000) were identified. There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases. 107 of 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19 patients tested positive again (re-positive rate 0.31%, 95% CI 0.423–0.574%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan was therefore very low five to eight weeks after the end of lockdown. One might suppose that this would be huge news. It would allow us to open up everything immediately. With the whole basis for post-curve-flattening lockdowns crumbled, we could go back to living a normal life. The fear could evaporate. We could take comfort in our normal intuition that healthy people can get out and about with no risk to others. We could take off our masks. We could go to movies and sports events. … We keep hearing about how we should follow the science. The claim is tired by now. We know what’s really happening. The lockdown lobby ignores whatever contradicts their narrative, preferring unverified anecdotes over an actual scientific study of 10 million residents in what was the world’s first major hotspot for the disease we are trying to manage. You would expect this study to be massive international news. So far as I can tell, it is being ignored. [More] In essence, what the study of 10 million people confirmed is what many people, doctors, scientists and World Health Organization already suspected. Like the common cold and flu when a person is infected with the virus they are only infecting others when they have symptoms: cold, runny nose, coughing, aching, sneezing, fever, congestion etc; hence, when a person has an illness they should isolate to not spread the virus. However, when a person has no external symptoms of the virus, just like the cold and flu, they are not a risk of transmitting the virus to others. ♦ This is a major issue with massive ramifications because all of the current COVID-19 mitigation effort is based on the principle that people can carry and spread the virus while having no idea they have it, and no symptoms. If asymptomatic transmission is not happening, and it appears with scientific certainty it is not, then all of the current lock-down regulations, mask wearing requirements and social distancing rules/decrees are based on a complete fallacy of false assumptions. The asymptomatic case study published in November affirms the earlier reporting from the World Health Organization that COVID-19 is only known to transmit from people who are showing symptoms of the virus.  In June of 2020, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said transmission of the coronavirus by people who aren’t showing symptoms is “very rare.” Bloomberg Markets and Finance 847K subscribers WHO Says Covid-19 Asymptomatic Transmission Is ‘Very Rare’ Watch later Share . As you can see from the video explanation, in June 2020 Ms. Kerkhove could not identify a single study or case that was traced to asymptomatic spread; but scientists still thought it might be possible so she -and others- kept using the “very rare” terminology. However, with the latest information and a far more lengthy timeline to study the disease, the cumulative 2020 data shows “very rare” actually means “never”, asymptomatic spread just doesn’t happen – EVER. So why is the entire world engaged in COVID-19 mitigation processes to block the transmission of a virus that has never, not even once, been identified as occurring?",TRUE

4ace902e,"Dan Jarvis: Winter death toll should shame coldest of hearts THE Office for National Statistics has released figures showing that a staggering 24,300 people died from mostly preventable causes over the course of winter last year. Fuel poverty must be tackled before more elderly people die needlessly, says Barnsley MP Dan Jarvis. Over the last five years, more than 152,000 of the most vulnerable people up and down the country have died over the winter months. That’s like losing a city the size of York in just five short years. In a modern Britain that’s completely unacceptable. Yet – to a greater or lesser degree – both Labour and Tory governments have seemed to simply accept that thousands of older, vulnerable people will die every winter because they can’t properly heat their homes, or get the care and support they need. That has to be a source of great shame for us all. So-called excess winter deaths are calculated by measuring the number of people who die during the period between November and March every year, and comparing that figure against the summer months. In common with most countries, in Britain more people die over winter than summer. However, our record compared with much colder countries like Germany and Norway is poor. Even across the UK there are huge differences in the numbers affected, with people in the South West much more likely to die during winter than in the East of England. All too many deaths over the winter are preventable; better heating, health and housing are the key to reducing excess winter deaths. It’s time to address this quiet crisis. Some of the stories from those most at risk over the winter months are heartbreaking, like 83-year-old William - a low income pensioner struggling to get by, having to choose between heating and eating. William has served in the Royal Navy, but he is now reduced to living in a home he describes as a ‘shack’ – which the local hospital warns may kill him. He suffers with respiratory problems and has to keep his flat warm to protect his health, but the money he spends on heating often stop him from putting a decent meal on the table. The mark of a civilised society is how we treat people like William. This is a problem we can – and must – solve, but it’s also a problem that no government has paid enough attention to. That’s why I’m calling on Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt to come up with a credible, ambitious, cross-government strategy that helps people stay safe over winter. While the Government has responded to my criticisms by pointing to their ‘Cold Weather Plan’, that ‘Plan’ fails to direct all of the many resources of government to addressing this problem. If their Cold Weather Plan was effective we would not have seen so many thousands of unnecessary deaths since it was introduced in 2011. Solving the excess winter deaths crisis is not just the responsibility of the NHS. All too often our Health Service is called in to help older or vulnerable people only when their situations have become life threatening. If we are to take the pressure off the NHS, Government ministers must take action to deal with the cold homes and fuel poverty that drive so many people to need medical help over winter. Neither, as the Government may have you believe, can this problem simply be left up to the energy companies to fix. Of course energy companies must offer a fair deal for customers, particularly those living in fuel poverty, but it is the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and the energy regulator – Ofgem – that have the ability to properly regulate the energy market. No one claims that all of the solutions to the excess winter deaths crisis are easy. Yet many of those solutions are within reach of government ministers if they had the political will to grasp them: better insulation for colder homes, more help for those living in fuel poverty, and support for lonely or isolated people to connect with their local communities. Yet in the face of 152,000 older, vulnerable people dying from largely preventable causes over just five years, this Government is still failing to offer real or meaningful action. They must take excess winter deaths seriously but their response so far has been nothing short of complacent and irresponsible. And it’s costing lives. That’s why I’m engaging with the major energy companies, housing providers and charities to address this problem and challenging them to do more this winter to reduce excess winter months and protect our most vulnerable friends and neighbours. If we want to save lives this winter, we need action now. And I, for one, am determined to make sure we get it.",Bonfire of the Insanities,TRUE

ccfaeb64,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month. Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline. Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas. In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017. A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program. “The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims. Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3. The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters. But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce. The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further. Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",Scientists caught 'adjusting' sea level data to create false impression of rising oceans,partially false

The government’s commitment to open 500 free schools over the next 5 years will create 270,000 school places across the country - giving parents more choice while challenging existing schools to up their game. Today, the first 18 projects of this Parliament have had the green light - creating more than 9,000 places across the country and giving more families the choice of an excellent education for their children than ever before. They will join the 252 already open and the 52 new free schools opening up their doors as schools head back this week. These will bring the total number of free school places created since 2010 to more than 236,000 - making this policy the most successful new schools programme, with schools being created more quickly than ever before. 500 more free schools The government has committed to opening 500 more free schools in this Parliament, creating good school places in communities across the country. To achieve this, 2 waves of schools will be announced every year up to 2020, with application deadlines in March and September. The latest application window to set up a free school opens on 28 September and runs until 7 October, with pre-application registration opening today. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today called on more groups to step forward, invest in the next generation and reap the rewards that opening a free school can bring. To help them do that she has committed to streamlining the process for existing high performing schools and encouraging businesses, charities, cultural and sporting bodies to enter the programme. Find out more about how to set up a free school. Prime Minister David Cameron said: As a ‘one nation’ government we are clear that every family should have access to a great local school and every child should get the very best education - and free schools are a crucial part of that aim. The aim of this policy is crystal clear - to increase the number of good and outstanding school places so that more parents have the security of knowing their child is getting a great education. Today’s announcement shows that we will not waver in pressing ahead with our plans to open 500 more of these innovative and exciting schools over the next 5 years, creating 270,000 places, delivering an excellent education and giving parents across the country real choice for their children. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: The free schools programme has sent out the message loud and clear, that parents should never have to settle for anything less than the best for their child. Right across the country, these innovative, community led schools are helping to fulfil our ‘one nation’ commitment to educational excellence for every child. We know that free schools don’t just give parents greater choice, they also force existing schools to up their game. Today’s news sends a clear message that we are committed to extending this unprecedented level of choice to more parents than ever before. The 18 new schools announced today include a number that will be set up by teachers themselves, showing the programme is putting power back in the hands of those who know children best. These include Solihull Alternative Provision Academy, set up by 3 headteachers of high-performing schools in Solihull, West Midlands, which will help transform the lives of local children who have fallen out of mainstream schooling. Other innovative schools due to be created include: XP East, a new secondary school for 350 children in Doncaster. XP East will have a deliberately-small campus feel, like its heavily-oversubscribed sister school, the XP School, and is influenced by a number of charter schools in America Gipsy Hill Secondary School, which will provide a classical and aspirational education for up to 1,600 children in South London. Opening in 2017, the school will educate children based around the classical ‘trivium’ - a system of thinking developed as far back as Ancient Greece that sees logic, grammar and rhetoric as the foundations of learning CAPA College, a specialist performing arts college in Leeds through which pupils can look forward to the opportunity to perform in world class venues, such as the Royal Albert Hall Piper Hill Vocational Learning Free School, a special school in Wythenshawe, Cheshire, which will help children with severe learning difficulties and autism spectrum disorder to improve their independence and employability skills through a range of courses that include horticulture and animal welfare Free schools Free schools are brand new schools set up by parents, teachers, charities, academy sponsors and existing schools in response to demand from the local community, either where there is a shortage of places, or where the parents are not happy with the places on offer. The new schools announced today, on top of the 252 already opened, and the 98 in the pipeline, will meet the growing demand of parents for more excellent local schools with high standards and strong discipline. 74% of open free schools are located in areas where there was a need for more school places and around half are in the 30% most deprived communities in the country. They are also more likely to be rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted than other schools - and research has shown they are helping to raise standards in neighbouring schools by introducing fresh ideas and competition. The free schools programme is also transforming the lives of many of society’s most disadvantaged and disaffected children. 17% of all free schools are dedicated to special needs or alternative provision, giving more help to those most in need. Policy Exchange research shows that as well as providing an excellent education to their own pupils, they are also associated with improvements in local poorly-performing schools. And more than two-thirds of free school heads say they are having a positive impact on schools in their local area - driving up standards and ensuring more parents have a great school in their neighbourhood. Building on the success of the programme, the government is now allowing free school applicants to apply for nurseries as part of their bid. This is all part of meeting the government’s pledge to provide flexible, high-quality childcare that allows parents to return to work. Today’s approved free schools Rugby Free Secondary School, Rugby, Warwickshire Rugby Free Secondary School will be opening in the town in September 2016. It is being set up by the trust behind Rugby Free Primary School, which opens in September 2015. The new, mixed, secondary will provide 1,260 much-needed school places for 11- to 19-year-olds. It will be a comprehensive school with an academic curriculum that will specialise in a combination of STEM science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects and music. John Donne Primary Free School, Peckham, London Proposed by the heavily over-subscribed John Donne Primary School JDPS , judged to be ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in October 2011, JDPS in Peckham will offer the same excellent education that is on offer at the parent school.

XP East, Doncaster, south Yorkshire The XP Schools Trust will open their second secondary school, XP East, in September 2017. The new 350 place school will be located next to the existing XP School in Doncaster in a deliberate move to create a small campus feel for both schools. The XP schools are based on an innovative approach to learning developed in certain charter schools in America in which subjects are taught through project-based learning. The XP School opened in 2014 and is proving so popular that there are 2 applications for each place. XP East will bring greater choice for parents and help to raise standards in Doncaster.

940bb348,"SHARE By Mary Burke's support of the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour might make for good politicking in her campaign for governor, but her plan would be economically devastating to thousands of Wisconsin workers. Raising the minimum wage is a lose-lose proposition because it will result in significant Wisconsin job losses, will reduce economic opportunity for younger and lower-skilled workers, will raise consumer prices and will not meaningfully reduce poverty or help the working poor. A recent analysis by the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would kill as many as 27,937 jobs in Wisconsin. That estimate is consistent with a projection by the Congressional Budget Office that predicted 500,000 lost jobs nationwide if the federal minimum wage was increased to $10.10. So how would raising the minimum wage result in lost jobs? The answer is quite simple. Increasing the minimum wage will increase labor costs for employers. In turn, employers will respond by reducing their workforce, hiring fewer workers and reducing hours of work for existing employees. That translates into job loss and fewer economic opportunities for workers. WMC recently commissioned a statewide poll to test this issue and found 53% of likely voters initially support increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. However, voters quickly abandon the proposal when told of the projected job losses. Support plummets to 39% when voters know raising the minimum wage kills jobs. In order to understand who will be harmed most by a minimum wage increase, it is important to understand who minimum wage earners are. The data show those who stand to lose the most from a minimum wage increase are younger and lower-skilled workers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage. That's because typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family. Wisconsin is no exception. According to the EPI analysis, the average household income of Wisconsin families impacted by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour is $58,812. That's actually higher than Wisconsin's median household income of $52,627. Clearly, the majority of minimum wage earners are not the working poor, but are instead young people entering the workforce with little experience and very few skills. They are people who desperately need entry-level jobs to begin the process of climbing the economic ladder by acquiring skills that lead to better jobs with higher wages. Unfortunately, increasing the minimum wage places the bottom rung of the economic ladder out of reach for many of these workers by eliminating entry-level positions that help workers gain the experience needed to advance in the workforce. Those who advocate a minimum wage increase as a means to reduce poverty are on the wrong side of history. Increasing the minimum wage has proven to be an ineffective policy in terms of reducing poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau recently released a report that found 59.7% of working-age people in poverty do not work. It is difficult to imagine how increasing the minimum wage will help lift people out of poverty when roughly 60% of those in poverty aren't even working in the first place. The empirical evidence also suggests raising the minimum wage simply does not impact poverty levels. Between 2003 and 2007, a total of 28 states increased their minimum wage beyond the level of the federal minimum wage. A study done in 2010 by Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser focused on the minimum wage and poverty found no evidence the minimum wage lowered poverty rates in any of those 28 states. Increasing the minimum wage is a poorly conceived economic policy that would cost Wisconsin thousands of jobs. It misplaces focus on the small sliver of the workforce (2.5%) who earn the minimum wage while simultaneously making it harder for entry-level workers to get ahead. Politicians should instead focus on how we can improve our state's business climate to attract and retain high-wage jobs such as those in our manufacturing sector. Scott Manley is vice president of government relations for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce.","The latest coronavirus threat really hits below the belt. A new study claims the coronavirus can not only rob you of your taste and smell — it may leave men infertile and could be transmitted sexually. The study, published last month in JAMA, a monthly open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association, found the presence of COVID-19 in 15% of semen samples collected. Researcher Dr. John Aitken likened it to the Zika virus. “It should be emphasized spermatozoa have a demonstrable capacity to carry viral infections from the male to the female reproductive tract, As happens during the sexual transmission of Zika, for example,” he told local San Antonio Fox 8. Zika virus is a mostly mosquito-borne virus that can also be sexually transmitted. The study also found that COVID-19 in human sperm “leads to a build-up of angiotensin II, which is a hormone that regulates kidney function and blood pressure.

But according to new data from NASA, one of the previously fastest shrinking glaciers in the world is growing again, calling into question the narrative that rapid climate change — i.e., global warming — poses a significant threat to the existence of the human race, let alone the entire planet. What are the details? For the last 20 years, the Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland was one of the fastest shrinking ice sheets in the world, losing on average 1.8 miles of ice annually while thinning 130 feet per year, according to The Associated Press. But in 2016 something changed: The glacier began growing again, at about the same rate it was previously retreating, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a newly published Nature Geoscience journal article. ""At first we didn't believe it. We had pretty much assumed that Jakobshavn would just keep going on as it had over the last 20 years,"" Ala Khazendar, the study's lead author, said, according to USA Today. More from the AP: A natural cyclical cooling of North Atlantic waters likely caused the glacier to reverse course, said study lead author Ala Khazendar, a NASA glaciologist on the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project. Khazendar and colleagues say this coincides with a flip of the North Atlantic Oscillation — a natural and temporary cooling and warming of parts of the ocean that is like a distant cousin to El Nino in the Pacific. The water in Disko Bay, where Jakobshavn hits the ocean, is about 3.6 degrees cooler than a few years ago, study authors said. In fact, the study said the waters in the region have cooled to temperatures not seen in more than 30 years. What does this mean for the future? While the development seems positive on the surface, it could spell bad news for the overall direction of the climate. NASA climate scientist Josh Willis, who participated in the study, noted that while the glacier's growth is positive, the study proves that glaciers are more sensitive to ocean temperature changes than previously thought, which could mean disaster in the future if the oceans experience sudden warming. ""All this is an indicator of how sensitive glaciers are to ocean temperatures,"" Khazendar explained to National Geographic. Meanwhile, University of Washington ice scientist Ian Joughin compared NASA's latest findings to that of the stock market. ""[The glacier's growth is] to a large extent, a temporary blip. Downturns do occur in the stock market, but overall the long-term trajectory is up. This is really the same thing,"" he told the AP.",The Point of No Return: Climate Change Nightmares Are Already Here,other
1f749900,"42% of all U.S. deaths 55,000+ 10% of all U.S. cases 296,000+ At least 55,000 residents and workers have died from the coronavirus at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for older adults in the United States, according to a New York Times database. As of July 7, the virus has infected more than 296,000 people at some 14,000 facilities. Nursing home populations are at a high risk of being infected by — and dying from — the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is known to be particularly lethal to adults in their 60s and older who have underlying health conditions. And it can spread more easily through congregate facilities, where many people live in a confined environment and workers move from room to room. While 10 percent of the country’s cases have occurred in long-term care facilities, deaths related to Covid-19 in these facilities account for more than 42 percent of the country’s pandemic fatalities.

45d1505d,"Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing is now in power of the State for the duration of the state of emergency, while Vice President U Myint Swe will now serve temporarily as President. Earlier this morning, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint and other National League for Democracy NLD officials across the country were detained by the military, ahead of the first parliamentary sessions scheduled to take place later in the day, according to U Myo Nyunt, spokesperson for the NLD, which won the 2020 elections on November 8. The Tatmadaw said it announced the state of emergency after repeated calls for the government and Union Election Commission UEC to clarify around 10 million voting irregularities went unaddressed, leading to protests and riots across the country. A request to suspend parliament was also ignored. The Tatmadaw said it is acting in accordance with the 2008 Constitution, under which section 417 states that if there is sufficient reason for the disintegration of the Union or national solidarity or that may cause the loss of sovereignty due to acts or attempts to take over the sovereignty of the Union by insurgency, violence and wrongful forcible means, the President may, after co-ordinating with the Natoinal Defence and Security Council, declare a state of emergency. Section 418 of the Constitution further states that the President shall declare the transferring of legislative, executive and judicial powers of the Union to the Commander-in- Chief of the Defence Services to enable him to carry out necessary measures to restore the Union. All legislative functions of parliament will be suspended and dissolved automatically from the day of declaration of the state of emergency. In Myanmar, access to TV channels, phone lines and internet services have been cut. In a statement by White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki said the US is alarmed by the steps taken by the Tatmadaw to undermine the country's democratic transition, including the arrest of State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. US President Joe Biden has been briefed of the situation. The US affirmed its support of Myanmar's democratic institutions, and urged the military to adhere to democratic norms ad the rule of law and to release those detained today. The US opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of the recent elections or impede Myanmar's democratic transition and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed, the statement said.",Myanmar announces state of emergency,FALSE
0fa4d5e1,"An overwhelming majority of the public would support renationalising the railways amid cancellations, delays and complaints of poor service from private rail operators, a new poll reveals. The exclusive survey for The Independent also found nearly six out of 10 people think that the privatisation of Britain’s railways has been a failure. Pressure has been mounting on transport secretary Chris Grayling as thousands of commuters faced weeks of cancellations and delays, after sweeping timetable changes were brought in by Govia Thameslink Rail GTR and Northern Rail. Theresa May branded the disruption “unacceptable” when she discussed the issue with her cabinet last week, increasing pressure on the transport secretary. It also comes after the East Coast mainline was taken back under public control, as the troubled franchise agreement between Virgin Trains and Stagecoach had to be scrapped. The BMG Research poll, which was conducted amid widespread rail chaos last week, found 64 per cent of voters would support bringing the railways back into public ownership, while just 19 per cent of people would oppose it. And 56 per cent branded the privatisation of the railways a failure, with only 15 per cent of people saying it had been a success.

Read our privacy notice The poll found a major appetite for tougher sanctions against private rail firms, with 80 per cent backing the prospect of major fines and only 9 per cent opposing it. Some 64 per cent believe the government has not properly held private firms to account over the quality of service they offer to the public, while only 20 per cent think rail companies have been reasonably scrutinised by ministers. More than 15,000 trains have been cancelled or delayed since the timetable changes came into force in May, with some passengers complaining they were at risk of losing their jobs. GTR was even forced to put on taxis to help teenagers get to school to sit their GCSEs in parts of Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. Last week, Mr Grayling laid the blame for the disruption with rail firms, telling MPs: “The huge growth in passenger numbers in recent years demanded expanded routes, services and extra seats, but this timetable change has resulted instead in unacceptable disruption for the passengers who rely on these services.” He added: “I am clear about the fact that the industry must and will be held to account for this, but my immediate priority is to ensure that we improve train services to an acceptable level as quickly as possible, and that will remain my priority.” However,shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: “He might want to blame Network Rail, but it is he who has failed in his responsibility to oversee it; the buck stops with him. “What is more, he has burnt his bridges with the leadership of Network Rail, which can only have damaged his oversight of this process. Is not this a terrible failure of him and his role atop the system?” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 13 April 2021 The core of the Milky Way becomes visible in the early hours of Tuesday morning as it moves over Bamburgh Lighthouse at stag Rock in Northumberland PA UK news in pictures 12 April 2021 Rebecca Richardson left and Genevieve Florence, members of the Aquabatix synchronised swimming team, during a practice session in the swimming pool at Clissold Leisure Centre in north London, which has reopened to the public.

07c4d47b,"THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL September 16, 2013 Guests: Ginger Gibson, Janis Orlowski; Garry Kasparov LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, HOST: We are about to hear more from Washington, D.C. police and FBI about the mass murderer who shot and killed 12 people in the Washington D.C. Navy Yard. A news conference is set to begin any minute now. We will bring it to you as soon ass underway. But here, 13 hours after those people were shot and killed, police say they are still working on identifying those victims and notifying their families. Three victims of the shooting, including one police officer, remain hospitalized tonight. But doctors expect those three to recover fully from their wounds. Navy Commander Tim Jirus was actually speaking to one of the victims when he was shot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CMDR. TIM JIRUS, U.S. NAVY: There`s an individual who came from the building behind us, I mean, this building. He came up and was talking to me, basically saying, hey, there`s a shooter in your building. Then I heard two more shots. One of them hit him. He went down in front of me and I took off from there. REPORTER: The guy you were with? JIRUS: The guy I was talking to. REPORTER: Got shot? JIRUS: Correct. REPORTER: And what was his situation afterwards? Did you move or did you try to assess? JIRUS: He was shot in the head. He did not look like he made it. So, I run from there. I don`t know if he was aiming for him or aiming for me. But I got out of there as soon as I could afterwards. I realized I couldn`t do anything else for him. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: The alleged murderer Aaron Alexis was shot and killed in a gun battle with police. Aaron Alexis was a U.S. Navy civilian contractor who worked in information technologies. Aaron Alexis previously served in the Navy Reserves between May 2007 and January 2011. Here is how Washington, D.C. police Chief Cathy Lanier described the scene. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF CATHY LANIER, DC POLICE: It certainly was one of the worst things we have seen in Washington, D.C. As officers entered the building and moved to the building, they were making transmissions and keeping commanders informed of what they were coming across as they went through, multiple victims. There was gunfire still going on. This is what we trained for. We were able to pull active shooter teams together and compliments to the partners here in the national capital region. We were able to pull officers from different agencies, put them in a single team and get them into the building within seven minutes. (CROSSTALK) LANIER: There`s no question he would have kept shooting. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Joining me now: NBC`s Kasie Hunt and ""Politico`s"" Ginger Gibson, who have been covering the Navy Yard scene all day. Kasie, you are at the scene of the press conference. What is it that we expect to learn at this hour? KASIE HUNT, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: At this point, it`s not definitive what we`re going to actually hear. But at this hour we`re really waiting for the sad accounting for the victims. We still don`t have a full picture of how many people died, although officials have said at least 13 civilians and we haven`t begun to understand who they are and go through that grieving process. So, at this hour, just a few blocks from where we are, there are still, by all accounts, thousands of people inside the Navy Yard waiting to be bussed out. The FBI has been talking with those who actually did have some connection with the event before they have been letting them out. They have been bussing people over to nationals park where there was supposed to be a baseball game tonight. So, we are still getting the full picture from people who were actually witnesses to what happened today. I did speak with one man who was nearby and who said they barricaded he and nine of his colleagues barricaded themselves inside a conference room. At one point, the ceiling was sprayed with bullets, and he said, while he didn`t see any casualties on his way out, he did hear from somebody that he knew that one of his friends, somebody he`d served with at the Pentagon had, in fact, been killed. So, at this point, we`re on hour almost 14 of sorting through exactly what happened today and still no real end to this terrible day for all of these people here -- Lawrence. O`DONNELL: Ginger Gibson, a place where thousands of people work, what was your -- how would you describe the confusion level today among people trying to get out of there, and people trying to figure out who`s left in there? GINGER GIBSON, POLITICO: I was at Nationals Stadium earlier today. As Kasie pointed out, it was supposed to have a baseball game, instead, it`s being used as a place where they a reunited families. A lot of families confused. A lot of families still looking for the woman whose mother was working inside the building where the shooting was. She was able to get in touch with her through a co-worker`s cell phone to a neighbor, but unable to get text messages or calls right away. A lot of people were texting assured that their family member was safe but still very worried, very nervous, not knowing what was going to happen next. And, you know, there are lots of people on the Navy Yard, still waiting to be able to go home. And their family members don`t know when they will get to see them next. They can`t drive their car. They don`t have any other way to get home for some of them. So, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of people trying to sort out what exactly took place. O`DONNELL: The latest update we have from law enforcement sources in Washington indicates that they have located the suspect`s rental car in the garage across the street from the building where the shooting occurred. The authorities are in the process of obtaining warrants to search that car and to search the hotel rooms of the suspect and his fellow contractors at the southwest Washington, D.C. residents` inn, where those contractors were staying. The same law enforcement sources said that it appeared that Alexis entered the building armed and one of the first persons shot was the security guard at the entrance. It is believed that he then took that guard`s side arm and either picked up the assault rifle from a safe or cabinet nearby, or also the guard may also have had a long gun with him. Kasie, this is one of the mysteries of the day, is it seems that the shooter ended up with three weapons but probably didn`t start with three weapons. HUNT: Absolutely. And there`s also been over the course of the day, as you remember questions about how many active shooters there were at any given time. And then you had police even confused, or not necessarily confused but warning the general public and reporters who were gathered outside the scene here that there could be more than one suspect in this case. We have since learned that it was just this, they believe now it was just confined to this one active shooter. We are starting to get some, as you outline, details more of where the guns came from. My colleague Michael Isikoff points out that a source told him that he would have passed a criminal background check to get the gun that he may have brought on to the premises himself. O`DONNELL: Let`s listen to what the suspect`s brother-in-law said earlier tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTHONY LITTLE, BROTHER-IN-LAW OF ALLEGED GUNMAN: Their initial reaction, I was not here for, but when I got here they were very distraught, stressed out, tears. They didn`t see it coming. It`s very hurtful. The hearts are going out more to the victims, the people that got hurt. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Ginger Gibson, I don`t want to read too much into that, but he doesn`t seem completely shocked. I mean, just says didn`t see it coming. But there`s -- I don`t hear a comment there about this is unimaginable. You know, he -- we would think he would never do something like this. GIBSON: We`re going to be waiting to hear maybe tonight the details of what happened inside that building or in the morning. But the more difficult part and the part we all want to know is why. How did he get to a point where he could do something like this? Listening to what the brother had to say. I know there are folks in Texas talking to friends, former roommates, co-workers, trying to put together those pieces is going to be difficult to try to grasp. We all want to grasp what would make someone do such a horrific thing. The brother-in-law didn`t seem too surprised but we have to remember, too, that shock is at play here. It`s very difficult to try to put together in such a short amount of time why and how someone could do something like this. O`DONNELL: We`re joined now by NBC News national investigative correspondent. Michael, what is your understanding of the latest version of where we are? MICHAEL ISIKOFF, NBC NEWS NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the latest version is, as you just reported, the rental car has been located across the street in the garage. And law enforcement authorities are trying to get the search warrant to search those. But there`s still, you know, the big unanswered question here is why. Motive has not yet been established. The closest that I have seen, Lawrence, are the interviews with the friends who talk about that he had some sort of beef with the contracting firm that had employed him, didn`t feel he was being paid, and was ticked off at them, and then also had this propensity for violent games, that I think one of his friends or acquaintances described him as obsessed with violent video games. Now, we heard that before with Adam Lanza and the Newtown shooting. But, you know, it`s still a far cry from playing those video games to committing an atrocity like this. So, it`s fair to say there`s a lot of unanswered questions. Just a couple of points on access to the base. We did get this statement tonight from Hewlett-Packard confirming that Alexis had been employed by a subcontracting firm called The Experts, which was part of an HP contract to refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps intranet network. Apparently, that involved installing new PCs when they went down and refreshing them, replacing them. But that did apparently give him access to the base and might explain how he got in there in the first place. O`DONNELL: We`re still waiting for the latest update from a press conference that Casey Hunt is attending. And, Michael, the -- there is information that has been developed now in the last few hours saying that this suspect had been treated multiple times for psychological issues, including sleep deprivation, anger, paranoia. Most recently, they said he had been treated at a V.A. hospital in New England, Rhode Island, possibly Massachusetts. So we are still in the process of developing this psychological profile. ISIKOFF: Exactly. There is clearly a lot that we don`t know. We do know we found that he had this arrest record. He had been arrested on misdemeanor charges in September of 2010, which is just a few months before his discharge from the Navy. It`s worth pointing out that the charges were dropped and they would not have been a barrier to him buying the weapon. We know that he -- or weapons. We know that or believe that he did purchase this shotgun in northern Virginia just -- northern Virginia, not far from Washington D.C. But nothing that we know of in his background would have prevented him from doing that or passing a background check. O`DONNELL: Michael, I have to interrupt you. We are going to a press conference. The mayor is about to speak. MAYOR VINCENT GRAY (D), WASHINGTON, D.C.: We will follow the same order of presentation that we did earlier. I will be followed by Chief Lanier, who will be followed by our FBI Washington director, and then Chief Chambers and Congresswoman Norton. We don`t have a great deal of new information to present to you at this point. I think we mentioned earlier that we had ruled out one of the suspects. No longer being a suspect. We continue to pursue the possibility of there being another shooter. We don`t have any evidence, any indication at this stage that there was yet another shooter even though we haven`t completely ruled that out. That was the person as you probably will recall who was identified as wearing an olive, drab uniform -- somebody around 55 years of age, around 5`10"", with graying sideburns. We have not identified that person nor do we have a lot of corroborating evidence. And maybe Valerie will talk a little bit about that, too, when she comes up. We don`t know what the motive is at the stage. We were asked earlier if there was likely terrorism involved. We have no indication of that. We haven`t ruled that out. We continue to investigate that. We know that there are 13 fatalities, including the shooter who perished today. We do have more information now on the decedents. Their ages are 46 years of age to 73 years of age. The families now are still in the process of being notified. Seven families have been notified and the process continues to notify the other six. We don`t know exactly when that process will be completed, but it is continuing now as we speak. I also want to update the issue around injuries. We didn`t have precise numbers earlier. We were using estimates. We now know that there are eight people who incurred one or another kind of injury. Of the eight, three were shot. They all are -- that includes Officer Scott Williams who the chief and I just went to visit earlier this evening who is doing well. He is in great spirits. There were two other civilians who were shot and they are relative minor injuries. The other five injuries range anywhere from stress action and someone who fell and had head injury, a contusion chest, arm abrasions and chest pain. So, again, a total of eight injuries, people who were hospitalized as a result of those and there`s absolutely no reason to think that there won`t be fined. One other point before I turn it over to Chief Lanier. We anticipate tomorrow morning that the traffic patterns will be back to normal in the city. All the bridges will be open, all the streets in the area of the Navy Yard will be open, even as the investigation, of course, will be continuing tomorrow and the days ahead. Again we have been in close contact with the White House. They`ve been a close contact with us and the president has reached out. His staff and the president through them have reached out to connect with us as this process has unfolded throughout the day. So again, this is a horrific tragedy. I want to thank all of the first responders who have done a terrific job dealing with this horrific tragedy. Our police officers and various law enforcement agencies that have done a sterling job, and I want to especially thank fire and emergency medical services for the work that they have done today as well. They had obviously many transports that they had to make and they did an extraordinary job doing that. And Chief Eleve (ph), where are you, Chief? I want to thank you for the work that you did today in order to be able to handle that important responsibility. So, with that having been said, let me ask Chief Lanier to come up and share some things with you -- Chief. LANIER: Thank you. I`ll pick up where the mayor left off. I can`t say enough about the first responders. All the training, exercising and daily interaction that we have here with more than 30 law enforcement agencies of some type in the district. The team work as we hear story after story and having been on the scene and listening to transmissions throughout the course of the day, 24 years doing this in the city. I`m very proud of the team work. The ability to quickly pull together to spare the teams of law enforcement, the heroic efforts, United States Park Police working with Metropolitan Police Department quickly entering the building along with security from the Navy Yard, as well as support from partners quickly brought in mutual aid, Maryland state and park police helicopters, as well as Fairfax, to see three difference jurisdictions had less than 45 minutes to coordinate emergency response, whether it`d be fire, emergency, medical, support from Prince Gorges County brought to DC fire EMS, to medevac support brought in through United States park police and their medevac, just incredible work. United States Marshall Service entering buildings with teams of MPD. Also, NCIS who assisted in picking up and carrying an injured police officer out of the building, story after story, we`ve heard from police officers and firefighters just terrific responses and thank you for all of the local and regional partners who responded. I will say Metro Transit as well. The special recognition that really stepped up today to help us get large numbers of victims and survivors to various places that we needed to transport witnesses, never had to ask for any support. They are always there to provide what we need so we really appreciate the work of Metro Transit. As of right now with the last outstanding lookout that we had for the potential last person connected to the deceased shooter, that was a lookout we put out for a black male between the ages of 40 and 50 in an olive drab uniform. Obviously, we had multiple witness accounts that we were sorting through. We have now exhausted all means that we have available to either support or discount that lookout. And we are comfortable at this point to lift the shelter in place to the residents of the neighborhood. Thank them first of all, residents and businesses, for supporting us and sheltering in place for an extended period of time, but we feel comfortable right now that we have exhausted all means to eliminate that possible last suspect. So, we do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person responsible for the loss of life inside of the base today. If anything changes, as we continue to go forward we certainly will make that available to the public. But again we are lifting the shelter in place and we appreciate the support from our community members. We will most likely have all of the traffic closures around the area open by 5:00 a.m. for morning commute. But we will make sure that is put out for the public in advance. Listen to your local news media before you come to work in the morning. And as of right now, we have, as we go through finalizing next of kin. We have identified one D.C. resident so far that are among the victims. So, in terms of our outreach in local community, our hearts go out to all of the victims certainly and at least one of our victims we have confirmed as a D.C. resident. At this point, we don`t have anything to support that any of the victims so far identified are active duty military. We have civilian and contractors so far that have been identified. We still have some work to do, but no active military have been identified amongst the victims at this point. So, with that, I will turn it over to the assistant director of the FBI, Val Parlave, and let her update you on their investigation. VALERIE PARLAVE, FBI: Good evening. As we have stated, this continues to be a very active investigation. The FBI`s evidence response teams continue to process the shooting scenes. These teams have special capabilities to include bullet trajectory analysis and crime scene mapping. We continue to follow every lead related to the shootings, to include piecing together the movement and activities of Aaron Alexis. While we have learned some information about his recent whereabouts, we continue to work to determine where he has been, who he has talked to, and what he has done. This includes determining the origins of the weapons he used, but because this investigation still continues, we will not comment further on the weapons used in today`s shooting. We can confirm, however that Mr. Alexis had legitimate access to the Navy Yard as result of his work as a contractor. And he utilized a valid pass to gain entry to the Navy Yard. We continue to work to identify and locate additional witnesses to today`s events and any individuals who may have information about Mr. Alexis. We appreciate the information provided so far by the public and we continue to ask for any and all information related to Mr. Alexis and today`s tragic events. Please report this information by calling 1-800- CALL-FBI. That`s 1-800-225-5324. And we again thank the public for your cooperation and will continue to update you on this investigation as it progresses. Thank you. CHIEF TERESA CHAMBERS, PARK POLICE: And simply from the United States Park Police. You heard Chief Lanier talk about team. We were part of that team this morning. We now have a more subordinate role, but we commit to her and to Assistant Director Parlave and the mayor that we will provide whatever resources available and appropriate to help complete this investigation. Thank you. DEL. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON (D), WASHINGTON, DC: Thank you more mayor for bringing us to this last report to the city and to the region. As in the beginning, our thoughts are with the victims and their families and they will also be our first thoughts tomorrow when Congress reconvenes and I go on the floor to lead moments of silence. We`re not going to be silent about the tragedy that occurred here today. There are many outstanding questions. I would say most of the questions are outstanding. For many of us in this city who have been plagued by gun violence, among them is how someone, whatever his badge, managed to get a high powered gun into one of the most secure facilities in the District of Columbia. I`m sure the Navy will be doing its own investigation. Tomorrow I will be working with others to get an independent investigation of what occurred here. I`m very, very proud and very grateful for the federal and D.C. police who responded so promptly. They have made the District of Columbia since 9/11, the most protected and secure city in the United States. But we do not fool ourselves. We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourselves impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today. We take very seriously security at one of our most secure facilities is penetrated and where the security is breached. But we also regard the Naval Sea System Command as a neighbor, a part of this residential mixed use neighborhood. And we like it that way. I appreciate -- continue to appreciate the banquet room they built so that they could accommodate residents. And I`ll be working with the Navy and the Naval Sea System Command to maintain the relationship with the neighborhood while shoring up the security here in the neighborhood and at the facility. Thank you very much. GRAY: All right. We will take a few questions. REPORTER: Question to the special agent in charge, can you just characterize the (INAUDIBLE) PARLAVE: There is still quite a bit of work left to do inside, processing the scene. I would expect them to be there for the next couple of days finishing up. It took us a while to clear the building with our tactical teams and they haven`t actually been in there that long, processing the evidence on scene. So, I would say, you know, 48 hours wouldn`t be unreasonable. REPORTER: There are a lot of people still left in there, the Navy Yard? PARLAVE: I believe most of the people who were alive have been cleared from the Navy Yard. REPORTER: All civilians and contractors were among casualties. Do you have any belief that the shooter was intentionally avoiding shooting military personnel? PARLAVE: We have no information right now as to motive. REPORTER: The congresswoman was talking about bringing a high powered weapon into the building, into the yard. Is there any sense that the suspect was able to lift any of the weapons off of the victims? PARLAVE: That is part of the ongoing investigation and I can`t comment on that. REPORTER: There have been reports that a rental car has been found near the scene that belong to the gunman. Can you confirm? PARLAVE: We are processing vehicle at the scene related to the shooting. REPORTER: Are there reports of other officers injured in the Navy guards on base or park place -- LANIER: We do have one park officer with injuries, not a gun shot injury, but other related injuries to the incident. I believe we do have one contract, I believe contract security working with the naval district of Washington. We will confirm as we go forward, but I do believe we do have at least one. (INAUDIBLE) LANIER: He`s in very good spirits. His family is here, parents, brothers and sisters. He has been on the department 23, almost 24 years. In fact, came on right about the time I did. We worked together for many, many years. He is a K-9 officer. He`s in very good spirits. He`s got a pretty serious injury, but right now, his family is here with him and he is in good spirits. The mayor was up visiting with him as well and he was certainly very complimentary of the partner agencies who helped to get him out of the building and D.C. Fire and EMS helped to get him medical attention that he needed. He is just very grateful for all the other responders that helped to get him out of the building and get him the medical attention he needed. But great police officer. I have known him for most of his 23 years and he`s got a stellar record. REPORTER: Chief, why did you think there was a second shooter and why is that not so? LANIER: Well, obviously, the more information that we can put out, as time goes on. But we always err on the side of caution through conglomeration of witness victim interviews, some camera views. There was potential that there could have been other shooters involved and we believed that the best action for us to take was to make sure our community was safe first. And we weeded through that information, secondly. We certainly want to clear the community as quickly as possible but we would rather err on the side of caution so we did that. And we have spent the last several hours trying to go through everything possible to make sure that we were 100 percent comfortable that we had cleared that information and get it out as quickly as possible. So, again, sometimes we ask for a little bit of patience from our community but our goal is to make sure that everybody is safe and that there is no additional harm. And that`s our goal, no addition harm once we arrive on the scene. GRAY: Last question, last question. REPORTER: At one point (INAUDIBLE) LANIER: No, there will be a press release put out following this event. I believe that is already completed. So, those victims that have been identified, confirmed and notified will release that following. This press briefing, I believe it is here with us so we can hand that out. And as the next of kin are notified, we`ll put out the remainder. GRAY: Thank you all very much. O`DONNELL: Michael Isikoff, so there we have the investigation conclusion at this stage that the suspect that was killed today is as the police chief put it, the single and sole person responsible. ISIKOFF: Right. And one piece of new information that is worth noting here is that he did have a valid pass and legitimate access to the Navy yard in his capacity as a contractor. And what is interesting about that, Lawrence, he was working, according to the statement we got from Hewlett Packard on this Navy Marine Corps intranet network, which is a clues network, which does suggest that there would classified work involved. And in order to do that, the presumption would be, he would have to have some sort of security clearance and have undergone some sort of background check. Now, we have not confirmed what level that is or what sort of background checking underwent. But to work on a closed military network like that would normally require that kind of clearance, some sort of clearance. So, I think there is g to be an addition to the questions that Congresswoman Norton raised about the billing to purchase the weapon. And as I put it up before, we have no felony conviction that we know of in his background. There is, I think additional questions about what sort of background check he underwent to get this job. O`DONNELL: Michael Isikoff, thanks very much for joining us tonight. ISIKOFF: Thank you. O`DONNELL: Coming up, the chief medical officer of the hospital that took in the wounded joins me. And who the extraordinary press conference today, Dr. Janis Orlowski forced us to think about why these kinds of shootings keep happening in America. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DOCTOR JANIS ORLOWSKI, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, MEDSTAR WASHINGTON: I`m Doctor Janis Orlowski. I`m the chief medical officer at MedStar Washington hospital center. I`m here to give you an update regarding the three individuals brought to the hospital center. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: The Doctor Orlowski was then able to announce that the three shooting victims her team was treating are all going to recover including the police officer who was shot multiple times. Then 15 minutes later in that press conference, in a response to a question about the hospital`s experience treating gunshot victims, Dr. Orlowski said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ORLOWSKI: We see a lot of trauma and, you know, sometimes it`s just accidents that occur. And then you see what I call senseless trauma. And there is something evil in our society that we as Americans have to work to try to eradicate. I have to say I may see this every day. I may, you know, be the chief medical officer of a very large trauma center, but there is something wrong here when we have these multiple shootings, these multiple injuries, there is something wrong. And the only thing that I can say is we have to work together to get rid of it. I would like you to put my trauma center out of business. I really would. It`s a great city. It`s a great country and we have to work together to get rid of this because we just cannot have one, you know, more shooting with, you know, so many people killed. We have got figure this out. We have got to be able to help each other. It`s a challenge to all of us. Let`s get rid of this. This is not America. This is not Washington D.C. This is not good. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Joining me now from MedStar Washington hospital, Dr. Janis Orlowski. Thank you very much, Dr. Orlowski, for staying up late on this very long day to join us now. Your know, your comment there towards the end of your press conference really captured the nation`s attention today beyond the very helpful information that you gave about your patients. It sounds like it is a truly wearisome duty that you have there, processing a of these gunshot victims not just today but Washington D.C. in and out of that hospital. ORLOWSKI: Well, I think it is. The recorder asked me a question. She said we know you to be a great trauma center. We know that you are taking care of victims, but is there something different about today? And I think that I spoke not only as a physician as the chief medical officer, but I spoke as a mother, as someone who is in this community and it is not only weary. I have to say that I worry about this. I worry about our community. Mass murders, people walking through schools, people walking through movie theaters, people walking through workplaces. Unfortunately it is common or more common than what it should be. And I think that I spoke from the heart when I said we have got to work together as a community to stop this. O`DONNELL: You are certainly in emergency medicine doing your end of this terrible task. But does it feel at the end of this task that society, that government that we are in fact not coming together as you said we must in order to minimize how much of this burden we are sending into our hospitals? ORLOWSKI: I think that there is much more that we can be doing and that we should be doing. We have multiple mass murders throughout the United States. We have individuals who some of them we know needed mental health care. A number of them could have been identified. I think that we just as you would see anyone who is bleeding on the street to call 911, I think we he to be able to identify and help those individuals who suffer other illnesses that make them act in this way. I believe that it`s not just rage. I believe that it`s not just anger. I believe that it is an illness. So, it`s an evilness to have someone raise arms against their fellow man. It`s wrong. We need to work to eradicate it. And whether it`s more support, more mental health, whether it is programs to help individuals, I spoke frankly when I said to the country and to the people who were listening we h",Rick Perry: Democrats living 'in a fantasy world' with climate change rhetoric,partially false

OPPORTUNITIES DENIED
Working Families And The State’s Youngest Learners Left Out
HIGHLIGHTS
• Last year’s meager investment in pre-K — the smallest since 2014 — added just 476 new
full-day seats for 4-year-olds in 14 districts. Continuing that strategy, it will take state
leaders 163 years — eight generations — to meet their commitment to offer every
4-year-old quality full-day pre-K.
• Governor Cuomo indicated he plans to add $15 million for pre-K expansion in the
2018 budget. If he makes good on that promise, New York will still leave behind three
generations of 4-year-olds. It would take nearly 57 years to make pre-K truly universal.
• More than 81,000 4-year-olds — 79 percent of those expected to enroll outside
New York City still have no full-day pre-K, despite growing demand from parents and
school districts.1
• Only New York City now offers Pre-K for All and is now rolling out pre-K for all its 3-yearolds. The City’s progress is appropriately recognized as path breaking. State leaders should
keep their commitment to all of New York’s children and add funding for the rest of
the state.
• The failure to expand pre-K also shortchanges dual language learners and those with
special needs who greatly benefit from a full day pre-K and integrated classrooms.
• The state still lacks a sustainable and predictable funding and financing strategy, putting
many districts and programs at risk for the future.
• The cost of child care in New York remains the highest in the nation. Yet, 80 percent of
families eligible for child care assistance are denied support.2
 State leaders made the
crisis worse last year by cutting $7 million from the state subsidy program. Again, young
learners miss the opportunity to be ready for kindergarten.
• Rates for child care and pre-K still fail to reflect the true cost of providing services,
threatening the stability of programs and their ability to appropriately compensate
teachers and staff.
Investments in quality child care and full-day pre-K more than pay for themselves, especially
in tough economic times. They are proven strategies for reversing the growing income
inequality in New York State, the most extreme in the nation by giving every child the
resources to become successful wage earners.
New York State leaders must build opportunity and stem inequality by expanding
investments in quality child care and full-day pre-K.

ENSURE EVERY CHILD IS READY TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND LIFE
MAKE QUALITY EARLY LEARNING TOP PRIORITY IN 2018 BUDGET
Recommendations for the 2018 Executive Budget
EXPAND ACCESS TO FULL-DAY QUALITY PRE-K
• $150 million to continue to add full-day high-quality pre-K seats outside of New York
City, including:
– $125 million to expand early learning opportunities for 15,000 3- and 4-year-olds, with
funding levels sufficient to assure quality in all settings, appropriating at a minimum of
$10,000 per child for classroom serving 4-year-olds and $12,000 for 3-year-olds.
– $25 million in supplemental funding to enhance quality and eliminate barriers
to expand pre-K, including an investment in regional technical assistance centers to
support districts to meet the highest quality standards.
• Ensure the $340 million grant, which supports New York City’s Pre-K for All program and
programs in 52 districts outside New York City is secured.
REFORM PRE-K FINANCING
• Continue to consolidate the pre-K funding and move toward a single pre-K program,
with funding for additional slots distributed by allocation, like other education
funding, with funding levels sufficient to assure quality in all settings.
• Conduct a cost–study of quality pre-K as recommended by the Board of Regents Blue
Ribbon Committee to establish an aid formula for pre-K with funding levels that
support the true costs of quality, including a appropriate compensation and support
for qualified and effective teachers in both community programs and public schools.
EXPAND ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILD CARE
• Invest $100 million to expand access to child care for working families, and stabilize
the child care workforce and infrastructure. Part of the investment could be met by
directing a portion of economic development dollars, a strategy that recognizes the
critical role of child care in boosting workforce participation, improving productivity and
the need to bolster the local child care industry. The investment should:
– Expand access to child care assistance to serve more children.
– Restore the reimbursement rate for child care services to the 75th percentile, to
stabilize child care capacity.
– Support programs to meet the increased costs of new minimum wage standards
without increasing costs to low-income families in need of child care.

GOVERNOR CUOMO AND THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE:
KEEP THE PROMISE TO NEW YORK’S YOUNGEST LEARNERS
For two years running, Governor Cuomo touted the power of quality early childhood education
to boost children’s life chances. Using the exact same statement, word for word.
The sentiment is bipartisan.
“What is more important than making sure youngsters get the best foundation possible?
I will fight this year to get money put in the budget for UPK.”

left in the shadow of opportunity,” as the Governor has observed. Nearly a quarter of all children
under 5 in New York now live in poverty, a reality that is especially harmful to young children and
their families. Early childhood education is a proven strategy for moving both children and
families ahead, preparing children for success in school and life and ensuring family economic
security.
It’s now time to put New York’s budget where the rhetoric is.
At the pace of last year’s investment of only $5 million in new funds
IT WOULD TAKE 163 YEARS to keep the promise for every 4-yearold to have full-day pre-K. Governor Cuomo has promised to add $15
million in 2018. Even if he makes good on that plan, it would take
nearly 6 decades to meet the goal.

KEEP THE PROMISE FOR FULL-DAY PRE-K
Every 4-Year-Old Deserves the Opportunity to Succeed in School
In 2014, Governor Cuomo made a bold pledge to make high-quality full-day pre-K available to
every 4-year-old in New York State within five years and an investment of $1.5 billion. There was
bipartisan support and the legislature agreed, making a down payment toward meeting that goal
of $340 million with $300 million earmarked for New York City’s groundbreaking Pre-K for All
programs. The national media and policymakers recognized New York’s leadership for setting
that goal.
But with each passing year, the promise rings more hollow, with state policymakers scaling back
expansion plans to nearly a halt. Last year’s meager investment of $5 million resulted in just 479
new full-day seats for 4s, leaving more than 81,000 4-year-olds outside New York City without
access to full-day pre-K.3
Continuing that strategy, it would take state leaders 163 years to meet the goal. The
Governor proposed adding $15 million in 2018. At that rate, it would still take nearly 57 years to
meet the goal.

INVEST AT LEAST $125 MILLION IN THE 2018 BUDGET TO EXPAND
ACCESS TO QUALITY PRE-K OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY
Long Island’s 4-year-olds are the least likely in the state to have full-day pre-K; with a seat for just
one in 10 of those expected to enroll. This fact is a source of growing frustration, even outrage,
to families educators increasingly, the region’s elected officials. “We are here today to declare we
want pre-K for all our students on Long Island,“ Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages declared last
month, at a bipartisan press conference, aimed at highlighting the inequity.4
 Need is also growing
among the Island’s preschoolers, with a 9 percent rise in poverty among children under the age of
six in the last decade, adding urgency to call for new state investment in pre-K outside the City.5
“I will fight this year to get money put in the budget for UPK,” declared state senator Carl
Marcellino added, on December 11. “What could be more important than making sure youngsters
get the best foundation possible?”
Long Island parents live within New York City media markets and are keenly aware of the City’s
annual recruitment campaigns to fill every seat in the City’s Pre-K for All program. “When people
move to Long Island, they expect those programs for their 4-year-olds,” Solages added.
There is similar frustration upstate,
especially in smaller districts, many
in rural areas that are still shut out of
pre-K expansion. “Chautauqua County
is a small, extraordinarily rural county,
and we are often neglected in terms of
services needed and not provided by
New York State. Unfortunately, pre-K
is no exception,” says Beth Starks, Early
Childhood Education Coordinator at
Jamestown Community College and
Director of Chautauqua Lake Child
Care Center. One third of Chautauqua’s
young children live in poverty, the very
children that research shows can most
benefit from quality early education.
Chautauqua county has 18 different
school districts and fairly inadequate
UPK offerings across the county.
There are only 3 districts out of the 18
who qualified for the last 2 rounds of
expansion. “We know the value of early
childhood education and are eager
to add pre-K, but without the state
investment, our pre-K is inadequate to
support our children.

Rising Poverty, Rising Diversity Adds to Urgent Unmet Need
Changing demographics across the state, especially rising poverty and growing numbers of
immigrant families with children who are dual language learners (DLLs) make this investment an
imperative, if state leaders are serious about putting New York’s rising generations on a path to
success In school and life.
New York State now ranks third in the nation in the pace of welcoming immigrant families, with
43 percent of children birth to eight now DLLs, that is, living in a home where they are exposed
to a language other than English.6
 Governor Cuomo and other state leaders have celebrated the
state’s new diversity, creating a state office for New Americans in 2013, and proclaiming New York
a “state of immigrants” in 2017.7
 In one 2017 statement, Governor Cuomo declared all are welcome,
deserve respect and equal opportunity “whether you are Muslim or Christian, rich or poor, black or
white or brown, we respect all people in the state of New York. It’s the very core of what we believe
and who we are.”8
Suburbs adjacent to New York City — especially the Hudson Valley and Long Island — now rival
the City in their diversity; with 43 percent of 4-year-olds in the Hudson Valley are now DLLs, and
38 percent of those on Long Island.
“Currently only a third of Westchester school districts are funded by New York State to offer pre-K
to their students. Westchester’s reputation as a beautiful area of large homes and country clubs
doesn’t tell the whole story. Many working families struggle mightily to bring home an income and
get their children off to the best possible start in school and life. It should not be this difficult. New
York needs more investment in high quality early learning and we need it now,” says Kathy Halas,
Executive Director, Child Care Council of Westchester.
Pre-K enrollment data provided by New York State Education Department (NYSED). The number of 4-year-olds expected to enroll in
full-day kindergarten is based on the following assumptions: 85 percent of children attending kindergarten, minus children enrolled in
4410 special education schools.
*NYSED estimates that New York City currently serves about 92 percent of all 4-year-olds expected to enroll. The City has adopted an
official policy of universal access, however, with the promise of a full-day seat to every 4-year-old who seeks to enroll.
See Appendix A for more detail on number of children currently enrolled and those expected to enroll, by community.

Without an investment in quality, full-day pre-K, inequity rises, and grows for children right
through high school. “Reducing disparate outcomes for our children is a heavy lift without
equitable access to high-quality pre-kindergarten experiences for all students,” Constance D.
Evelyn, Superintendent Valley Stream 13.
This is especially true for the state’s growing number of dual language learners.
With quality pre-K, which includes appropriate supports for DLLs, and respect for their home
language, this gap can be reduced or even erased. In fact, the latest research shows that DLLs
bring special strengths to learning, and are even more creative problem-solvers, when they are
supported and welcomed into high-quality early education.9
New York’s bedrock vision for pre-K explicitly recognizes early childhood education as
foundational to success in today’s global economy.10 Recently, state education officials have called
for more support for dual language learners and a long-term vision for multi-lingual public
education, starting in pre-K program.11 This new attention is critical given New York has been
slow to appropriately support dual language learners, even as the number of immigrant families
and cultural diversity surged across the state. There is also increasing demand from families of all
backgrounds to ensure their children speak a second language, and an increasing demand for such
opportunity to begin in the early years. Languages are most easily acquired in the early years, and
research shows that waiting until kindergarten or later can be counterproductive, even harmful, to
children’s success, undermining their confidence and language skills later on.12
“As we think about universal access to prekindergarten, we have to be thinking about the
demographics of the preschool population —
who our children really are. There is increasing
linguistic diversity among young children
requiring approaches in pre-K that reflect our
understanding of the relationship between
language and learning. Linguistic diversity
signals a moral imperative to support
and protect children’s eventual academic
achievement by integrating their home
languages in all aspects of instruction and
programming in pre-K,” says Zoila Morrell,
Deeper Learning Equity Fellow at Mercy College
and member of the Blue Ribbon Committee of
the Board of Regents. “Today, we need to plan
for both bilingual education and bilingualism
in education where all teachers, bilingual or
monolingual themselves, welcome, invite, and
use children’s home languages in the teachinglearning process.”

No Pre-K Expansion = Harsh Consequences for Children with Special Needs
Expanding pre-K also meets the urgent need to expand opportunity for children with disabilities,
whose options are rapidly shrinking. From its inception, top policymakers have seen the state’s
Universal Prekindergarten program as a critical pathway to better serve the 10 to 15 percent of
children with disabilities.13 Research shows that diagnosing and offering appropriate support to
children with special needs in the early years can improve their educational success — and reduce
the need for more expensive remedial education later on. Research also shows, and state and
federal laws require, that children with disabilities have access to early education, and be served
in the “least restrictive environment,” one which allows them to learn with other children of all
abilities. Without universal prekindergarten classes, such opportunities simply don’t exist for most
children. Special education funding is declining, limiting any option for the support that could put
them on a path to success.
“The consequences are visible across the state, with preschools closing their integrated classes at
an alarming rate and the opportunity for preschool students with disabilities to be educated with
their typically-developing peers diminishing by the day, says Chris Treiber, from the InterAgency
Council for Developmental Disabilities. “Keeping the promise to make pre-K truly universal with
a full-day service for all preschoolers is essential, if New York State is to ensure that preschool
students with disabilities have opportunity to attend high-quality inclusive early childhood
programs.”
The Board of Regents recognizes this urgent need, calling for funding to support new models
for integrated classes in as full-day pre-K expands.14 Without new investment in 2018, such
opportunities will be foreclosed.
Meeting the Promise for All Children
Studies show all children can benefit from the diversity that free quality universal prekindergarten
offers.15 “Young children learn from their peers and every child brings something unique to share,
whether it be resilience or a great vocabulary,“ says Marsha Dumka, from SUNY Empire State
College, based in Rochester,
where 97 percent of the city’s
4-year-olds are now enrolled
in pre-K.”16 “Truly universal
pre-K creates the chance to
make friends: learning from
and with peers from diverse
backgrounds, with a range
of abilities and traditions
enriches learning, social skills
and understanding of our
world.”
Yet only New York City and
Rochester have met the
promise of universal pre-K,
while 81,000 other 4-yearolds are still shut out.

REFORM PRE-K FINANCING TO SUSTAIN QUALITY PRE-K NOW AND
IN THE FUTURE
Last year, state leaders took the critical first step to consolidate the state’s multiple pre-K funding
streams, secure them and move toward a single state pre-K program in 2020. But the state still
lacks a sustainable financing strategy to sustain existing programs and establish appropriate
funding levels for new seats.
The plan for consolidation offers the promise to secure all existing pre-K funding, one year at
a time, as competitive grants expire. That approach essentially freezes districts in place with
disparate funding levels and with partial implementation of full-day pre-K for 4-year-olds. Some
are frozen at funding levels as low as $2700 per child and have been shut out of the expansion of
full-day pre-K, even as parents and educators clamor for it.17
The state should establish an aid formula for pre-K, distributed via annual allocation like other
education funding. The aid formula should set funding levels based on the true cost of meeting
quality standards, including sufficient funding to recruit and retain qualified and appropriatelycompensated teachers in all settings, both in public schools and in community-based early
childhood programs. The state should undertake a cost-study, as recommended by the Board of
Regents in its Blue Ribbon Committee to establish the actual costs of quality pre-K in New York.
But children can’t wait another year for new investment at funding levels necessary for a quality
program. They will be kindergartners.
In 2018, the state should add $125 million to add new seats outside New York City, funded
at $10,000 per child or double the districts half-day Universal Prekindergarten allocation,
whichever is greater, until an aid formula is established, based on the study of actual costs.18
Data on state’s pre-K investment since 2014 from New York State Education department. For more on the state’s total investment in
prekindergarten, see Appendix. For more detail, see Historical Trends in New York State Pre-K Funding p. 24.

The precedent and promise for this funding strategy is already established through several
expansions of pre-K, including the $340 million grant in 2014 and the state’s implementation
of the federally-funded $25 million Preschool Development grant that same year. The state’s
focus on high-need school districts also offered many participating districts at least $10,000
per child.
The results of such a strategy are also well established, with universal access now achieved
in New York City and nearly universal enrollment in Rochester, where 97 percent of that city’s
4-year-olds now in full-day seats.
In 2018, the state should also set a separate rate for pre-K for 3-year-olds of at least $12,000
per child to address the specific needs of 3-year-olds as set forth in the state’s Early Learning
Guidelines. That includes smaller class sizes as well as teacher preparation and additional social
supports necessary for serving younger children. The state’s current pre-K rates, based on the
needs of 4-year-olds, simply don’t recognize those costs.
Strong research documents the value of starting early with children especially those considered
high-risk because of family circumstances. Offering two years of preschool can lead to larger gains
for children.19 States can produce even better outcomes when the services start even earlier and are
aligned from birth to school-age.20
Additional investment in 3-year-olds at appropriate rates also offers the opportunity for the state
to enhance resources for the many community-based programs that partner in delivery of pre-K
in New York, such as Head Start and child care programs that serve younger children as well.
Pre-K funding can add new resources to add children and augment resources, especially for
programs dependent on parent fees or shrinking public investments in child care.

“Syracuse has one of the highest urban poverty rates in the country let alone the
state. We know that pre-K is one of those things that works against poverty,”
says Kelly Ward, member of the Alliance of Communities Transforming Syracuse.
Syracuse did receive some funding to expand pre-K in recent years, but not the
full amount requested. “We need more of our half-day seats for 4-year-olds to
change for full-day, and we need more seats for 3-year-olds.” Syracuse also failed
to receive supplemental funding to support quality improvement, start-up or other
infrastructure. The lack of funding for transportation is an especially acute problem.
“Harsh winters and parents’ job schedules prevent our youngest learners from
getting to pre-K. With no transportation, they can’t get to school. Pre-K busing needs
to be reimbursed in the same manner as K-12 busing.”
INVEST $25 MILLION TO SUPPORT QUALITY IMPLEMENTATION —
AND ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO EXPANSION
The state has established high regulatory standards, but failed to invest sufficiently in the
necessary infrastructure and quality strategies as pre-K expands. The Governor’s Statewide Universal
Full-Day Prekindergarten program, up for renewal this year, established an important strategy of
addressing this need, with the inclusion of supplemental funding for expansion.
The 2018 investment should include an investment to fund regional technical assistance centers
to support this expansion, modeled after those created to support the expansion of community
schools and for special education. In addition, funds should be used to provide supplemental
funding for two critical purposes: (1) Evidence-based strategies to attract, retain and support
qualified teachers in all settings, including improved compensation as well as professional development, coaching and mentoring; and (2) Funding for other essentials of implementation, including
technical assistance and start-up funding to equip classrooms and cover transportation costs.
STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS AND SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY
PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE PRE-K SERVICES
The State has wisely chosen to deliver pre-K services through a mixed delivery system that includes
child care and Head Start programs in the community. Today, more than half of all pre-K services
are offered in early childhood programs outside the public schools. This is an essential strategy
that leverages existing resources and better serves the State’s working families who often need
extended hours and year-round care. Some of these programs offer the expertise and capacity to
create integrated settings, so children with disabilities and typically developing children can learn
together and from each other. Other community-based programs have experience and expertise
supporting children and families whose primary language is a language other than English. 
OPPORTUNITIES FORECLOSED, EQUITY DENIED. NEW YORK’S YOUNGEST LEARNERS STILL LEFT OUT! | 15
The State should offer more support to community partners with the capacity to offer integrated
classrooms, support for multi-lingual learners, and developmentally-appropriate programs for
3-year-olds. Many also serve infants and toddlers, creating capacity for stable, continuous care
and learning experiences that experts say can most benefit young children, improve educational
outcomes and support the State’s goal to create a continuum of early childhood education, birth
to third grade.
However, the funding levels often do not reflect the value of these settings and the disparities in
funding levels between schools and community based programs destabilizes a critical part of the
delivery system.
Our 2018 agenda for prekindergarten includes several key recommendations to address
these disparities, including the establishment of per-child rates for 3- and 4-year-old pre-K to
support quality standards. Meeting this goal offers a strategy and pathway to enhance resources
for many community partners and a starting point for equity across settings. The establishment
of a regional technical assistance centers also offers a venue to strengthen collaboration
between pubic schools and their community partners, supporting joint learning and leadership
in pre-K implementation.

EXPAND ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILD CARE
Another Key Investment in School Readiness and Economic Opportunity
Quality child care and pre-K are companion and complementary investments. Child care programs
offer year-round-services for the hours that working families need. Many serve infants and
toddlers and provide appropriate settings for these younger learners. As an additional investment,
child care funding offers another critical strategy to boost school readiness and expand economic
opportunities across New York, by keeping children learning and parents earning.
“Research shows that two or more years of high quality early care and education improve
children’s lifelong success, and low-income children derive the biggest gains. That means child care
is the vital bridge linking New York State’s two recent, momentous achievements for kids: our Paid
Family Leave law and Pre-K expansion for 3- and 4-year-olds,” says Larry Marx, Chief Executive
Officer, The Children’s Agenda. “But due to years of under-investment in child care assistance
for low-income working families, that bridge is at risk of collapse, with a particularly acute care
shortage for babies and toddlers. This early care continuum urgently needs reinforcement to
ensure a better future for all our children.”

Jeremy Corbyn blasted the policy this afternoon at Prime Minister’s Questions, after the Department of Health’s top civil servant warned patients could have to show passports to prove they were eligible for NHS care. He said 9.5 million people in this country don’t have passports, saying: “Rather than distracting people with divisive and impractical policies, could the Prime Minister provide the NHS with the money it needs?” But the PM defended the policy - which her own Department of Health chief admitted was “controversial”. “For many years there has been a concern about ‘health tourism’,” she said. “About people turning up in the UK, accessing health services and not paying for them. “We want to make sure those who are entitled to use those service are able to see those free at the point of delivery - but that we deal with ‘health tourism and those who should be paying for the use of our health service.” Jeremy Corbyn replied that the National Audit Office had noted the cost of ‘health tourism’ was “over a hundred times less than the £22 billions of cuts the NHS is facing from this government.” How much does ‘health tourism’ cost the NHS? Professor J Meirion Thomas, speaking to the BBC yesterday, cited Lord Bates as having said the cost of visitors to the NHS in 2012-13 £2bn, which is approximately 2% of the NHS budget. Asked if we clawed any funding back from other countries, Professor Thomas said: “As far as I know, we didn’t get anything back.” Is that true? No. Neither of these claims are accurate. The £2bn figure, seized upon by a string of right-wing politicians and newspapers, is - to be charitably - ‘hand-wavy’. First of all, it refers to all visitors, not just migrants. That means it includes people here on holiday who injure themselves, international students and expats who return here to see their old, trusted GPs. And yes, it occasionally includes genuine ‘health tourists’ who come here from other countries with the sole purpose of obtaining NHS treatment for free. The total cost of this is estimated at around £1.8 - 2bn a year. Most of that is A&E visits, which we generally don’t charge visitors for - and, it should be noted, wouldn’t be covered by the ‘passport’ plan. Non-emergency treatments add up to around £500m a year, about £100m of which is clawed back from other countries. So how much does health tourism actually cost? According to the same Government report which is being incorrectly cited by Professor Thomas , the estimated cost of deliberate health tourism is between £110 and £280m a year. Some estimates put it as high as £300m a year. Put that into perspective for me… It’s around 0.3% of the total NHS budget. The NHS spends around £200m more every year on stationery than it does on health tourism. Is there a better way for the NHS to save money? Well, missed GP appointments cost around £300m a year. The NHS could save more money by reducing those in some way, perhaps by charging a deposit.",The Conservatives have become the party of equality,TRUE
c4f8a375,"I have just been to Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty The Queen has asked me to form a new government, and I accepted. In David Cameron, I follow in the footsteps of a great, modern Prime Minister. Under David’s leadership, the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit, and helped more people into work than ever before. But David’s true legacy is not about the economy but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage, to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether; David Cameron has led a one-nation government, and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead. Because not everybody knows this, but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist Party, and that word ‘unionist’ is very important to me. It means we believe in the Union: the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it means something else that is just as important; it means we believe in a union not just between the nations of the United Kingdom but between all of our citizens, every one of us, whoever we are and wherever we’re from. That means fighting against the burning injustice that, if you’re born poor, you will die on average 9 years earlier than others. If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white. If you’re a white, working-class boy, you’re less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university. If you’re at a state school, you’re less likely to reach the top professions than if you’re educated privately. If you’re a woman, you will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there’s not enough help to hand. If you’re young, you’ll find it harder than ever before to own your own home. But the mission to make Britain a country that works for everyone means more than fighting these injustices. If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security. You have your own home, but you worry about paying a mortgage. You can just about manage but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school. If you’re one of those families, if you’re just managing, I want to address you directly. I know you’re working around the clock, I know you’re doing your best, and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle. The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws, we’ll listen not to the mighty but to you. When it comes to taxes, we’ll prioritise not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won’t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you. We are living through an important moment in our country’s history. Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change. And I know because we’re Great Britain, that we will rise to the challenge. As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us. That will be the mission of the government I lead, and together we will build a better Britain.","BRAZIL'S health authority has confirmed a volunteer has died after participating in the clinical trials of the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The country's health authority, Anvisa confirmed one person died in trials. However, it is understood the man took a placebo rather than the vaccine and the health authority confirmed trials will continue. The drug is currently undergoing phase three clinical trials. Brazil has plans in place to purchase the drug and produce it at its biomedical research centre if it clears the final phase of trials. Despite the death of the volunteer, Oxford University has stated there are no concerns surrounding the safety of the trials. The vaccine is seen as one of the leading drugs, with the UK Government signing a deal for 100 million doses. Trials of the drug were also put on hold in the US since September 6 after a volunteer fell ill. Both India and South Africa have resumed clinical trials of the potential vaccine. AstraZeneca has also signed an agreement with Europe's Inclusive Vaccine Alliance. Under this, 400 million doses could be ready to supply European countries who participate in the alliance. The UK has also secured 30 million doses of a separate drug made by BioNtech/Pfizer. Another deal worth 60 million doses, has also been agreed with Valneva - in total there are six vaccines under consideration by the Goverent. Despite this, it is uncertain when a vaccine will be in circulation or how successful it will be. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned it is unlikely a drug will be available until next spring. Speaking to the  Commons and Lords National Security Strategy Committee, he stated the virus will not be completely eradicated either. He said: ""It is unlikely we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine.” Previously, officials had claimed the drug produced by AstraZeneca could be available by the turn of the year. Head of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, Kate Bingham, claimed she was optimistic over the chances of a vaccine being developed by the UK's candidates. She said: ""I am optimistic that we will see something – four of our six vaccines are now in phase three studies, and in each of them we’ve seen very positive data in the phase one and two clinical studies, which shows that people who have received the vaccine do elicit a strong immune response, and that, and if you take the neutralising antibodies that are triggered those antibodies are able to kill live Covid virus.

50303c1b,"May 18, 2011  -- Leroy Fick hit the jackpot. The Michigan man won $2 million in the state lottery's ""Make Me Rich"" contest last June. With the $850,000 he took home after taxes, Fick, 59, used his winnings to purchase a new home and a used Audi convertible. But to buy groceries, this lottery winner is still using his Bridge Card, Michigan's version of food stamps. How can a man who won millions in the lottery still use food stamps? His lawyer says it is perfectly legal. ""He's not trying to cheat the state,"" said Fick's attorney, John Wilson. ""Based on his income, he's eligible."" In fact, Fick said he contacted Michigan's Department of Human Services after his lottery win to ask if he could still use his Bridge Card. ""They said I could go ahead and keep the Bridge Card if I wanted to,"" said Fick. So, he did. ""He specifically called the Department of Human Services and said, 'Can I still use the Bridge Card?' and they said, 'Yes,' because he is eligible,"" said attorney Wilson. ""He's done everything right in the eyes of the law."" Michigan uses federal guidelines that base eligibility for food stamps solely on income. Fick's attorney said his client is unemployed and lives on Social Security disability benefits, so his income qualifies him for the Bridge Card. The $850,000 lump sum lottery payment is considered an asset -- not income. So, under state policy, Fick can legally get food stamps -- even if he has hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank. ""This angers me. It really makes me angry,"" said Rep Charles Brunner, who represents Fick's hometown of Auburn in Michigan's 96th District. He is one of a number of lawmakers in a state battered by high unemployment and a whopping budget deficit now fuming over Michigan's lottery loophole. ""The thing that really bothers me is [that] in our state we have so many people out of work ... so many people in need of assistance, and for a lottery winner to get food stamps"" is unfair, Brunner said. ""If it's a glitch in the law, we've got to fix it now."" Today, Brunner introduced legislation in the Michigan House of Representatives calling for the state to factor in the assets of food stamp applicants, not just their income. Lawmakers are now scrambling to close that loophole. ""We are actively seeking a change to the food assistance policy to see that only those who are truly [in] need qualify,"" said Gisgie Gendreau, a spokeswoman for Michigan's Department of Human Services. Fick's attorney said his client will stop using his Bridge Card if Michigan changes its policy, and doesn't feel bad about using the taxpayer funded program because Fick just paid more than $1 million of his lottery winnings in state taxes. ""He feels like he's paid into the system,"" Wilson said. Even though his client won more money than many people earn in a lifetime, Wilson said Fick is not living like a millionaire. ""He lives a simple life,"" Wilson said. ""He doesn't even have the Internet.""",Obamacare will question your sex life,TRUE
cf80e76c,"The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com. On February 2, 1978—41 years ago!—The Wall Street Journal warned in a headline that “Low-Lying Lands Could Be Submerged by Climatic Disaster.” Fears of apocalyptic sea-level rise are nothing new despite the fact that they seem to have recently taken on a new life of their own, especially in South Florida, where I live. The only scientific correlation I can make with any certainty is that these fears rise in direct proportion to the number of socialists elected to Congress. So, let’s first talk about the science of climate change as it pertains to sea-level rise. Dr. Roy Spencer, who has a Ph.D. in meteorology, writing in An Inconvenient Deception, states that compared to Al Gore’s warnings of a sea-level rise of 20 feet, the actual measurement is one inch per decade for over 150 years with no observed acceleration. This could not be true if it were anthropogenic (human-caused), since there has been ample time for acceleration since 1940, “which is the earliest that humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions could have had any substantial effect.” Sea-level rise is a process that is mostly natural since it “predates the Industrial Revolution,” Dr. Spencer explains. This may be small comfort to the people living in Miami Beach, for example, where sea-level rise has been worse than the average. But a 2017 study reported that the land is sinking at a rate of 3 mm per year—equal to the sea-level rise—causing a doubling of the effect and magnifying the rise of water at lunar high tides. No one should “deny” climate change per se. It is a characteristic of the planet upon which we live. The argument boils down to how much of it is due to relatively recent anthropogenic increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide compared with the Earth’s natural climate fluctuations caused by other factors including solar activity. And it’s not just the science that is on the side of those appealing for moderation. Earth’s climate history also has a story to tell. A graph of the Earth’s mean temperature over the last 2,000 years shows two previous periods when temperatures were warmer than they are now; from 1–200 A.D., an epoch called the Roman Warm Period, and more recently the Medieval Warm Period from 900–1100 A.D. Historical records during the Medieval Warm Period report many benefits such as extended growing seasons, a reduction in infant mortality, and the explosive growth of Europe’s population. The Vikings colonized portions of Greenland and were able to plant warm-weather crops such as potatoes. It is worth noting that both of these climate optima occurred centuries before the discovery of fossil fuels and the invention of the internal combustion engine. Getting back to that 41-year-old Wall Street Journal headline, the article that accompanied it reported that the temperature rise due to the burning of oil and gas would result in a “sudden deglaciation of the West Antarctic, unfreezing enough water to raise world sea levels by five meters (about 16 feet).” It was further stated that such a sea-level rise could “result in the submergence of much of Florida, Holland and other low-lying areas in the next 50 years.” That scenario, though, depended on the worst-case scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, the worst-case scenario for warming, and the worst-case scenario for the effect of warming on the ice. None of those was at all likely, and none of them happened. It was far more likely that continental ice melt would continue at about the rate of the past thousands of years—about a foot per century, meaning it would take 1,600 years to achieve the feared 16-foot rise. And indeed that’s what’s happened. Sea level has continued to rise at about the same rate of a foot per century or 1.2 inches per decade. To achieve the 16 feet warned of 41 years ago in 50 years, the rate would now have to jump to 208 inches per decade—nearly 200 times as fast. Does anyone want to put a bet on that? If you’ve ever visited a new housing development, inland or along the coast, it doesn’t matter, you already know the sandy soil is littered with the shells of mollusks. Have you ever wondered why? A December 3, 1993, article that appeared in The Sun-Sentinel may have the grim news: “Rising and falling ocean levels complicate the geologic picture. The coast has shifted several times, which is why shells can be found far inland ….” Apocalyptic sea-level rise may simply be just a thing of the past. Gregory J.

964e13e1,"Iran Parliamentarians have moved a bill in order to protect the rights of children which includes a clause that lets a man marry his own adopted daughter considering the fact that she is 13 years old. However, activists of the country have expressed alarm that the bill sanctioned by parliament, gives an opportunity for the caretaker of a family to marry his or her adopted child if a court orders it is in the best interests of the individual child. Credits: Care2.com Iran’s Guardian Council, a body of clerics and jurists which reviews all parliamentary bills before the constitution and the Islamic law, has yet to give its final verdict on the controversial legislation. To the shock of rights campaigners, girls in the Islamic republic can marry as young as 13 years old if they seek permission from their father. On the other hand, boys can marry only after the age of 15. In Iran, a girl under the age of 13 can still marry but needs a judge’s permission. As of now, however, marrying stepchildren is prohibited under any circumstances. 42,000 children aged between 10 and 14 got married in the year 2010, as per the Iranian news website Tabnak. At least 75 children under the age of 10 were married in Tehran alone. Shadi Sadr who is a human rights lawyer with the London-based group Justice for Iran, told the Guardian website that she feared the council would feel safe and secure to put its stamp of acceptance on the bill while Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, grabs the attention of the press during his UN visit to New York. “This bill is legalising paedophilia,” she alerted. “It’s not part of the Iranian culture to marry your adopted child. Obviously, incest exists in Iran more or less as it happens in other countries across the world, but this bill is legalising paedophilia and is endangering our children and normalising this crime in our culture.” She added: “You should not be able to marry your adopted children, full stop. If a father marries his adopted daughter who is a minor and has sex, that’s rape.” As per Sadr, Iran officials tried to play down the sexual part of such marriages, adding that it is in the bill to fix the issue of hijab [head scarf] complications when a child is adopted. An adopted daughter is likely to wear the hijab in front of her dad, and a mother should wear it only in front of her adopted son if he is old enough, Sadr said. “With this bill, you can be a paedophile and get your bait in the pretext of adopting children,” Sadr said. Some experts reckon that the new bill is opposed to Islamic beliefs and would not pass the Guardian Council. However, an initial draft of the bill, which totally banned marriage with adopted children, was not sanctioned by the council and it is feared that MPs introduced the condition for marriage only to satisfy the jurists and clergymen. This is the reason why Sadr fears it can pass the council this time. The bill drew huge backlash in Iran with the reformist newspaper, Shargh, posting an article warning about its consequences. “How can someone be looking after you and at the same time be your husband?” the article asked. Shiva Dolatabadi who is the head of Iran’s society for protecting children’s rights gave a warning that the bill implies that the parliament is legalising incest. “You cannot open a way in which the role of a father or a mother can be mixed with that of a spouse,” she said, according to Shargh. “Children can’t be safe in such a family.” Though the bill was passed in 2013 as per media report, the news is getting unnecessary attention on social media in 2019.

As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I have spent my career fighting to make sure Veterans can get the care they have earned and deserve. In West Virginia, we believe in taking care of those who serve us, and that includes making sure their mental health care is one of our top priorities. I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation,” said Senator Manchin. It is estimated that more than 20 veterans die by suicide every day. Of those, 14 have received no treatment or care from the VA. The Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act will improve outreach to veterans and their mental health care options. The Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act is a comprehensive and aggressive approach to connect more veterans with the mental health care they need and earned. This bill seeks to improve VA care by bolstering the VA's mental health workforce and increasing rural or hard-to-reach Veterans' access to VA care. Additionally, this bill supports President Trump’s recent executive order on Veteran suicide by funding alternative treatments from community-based organizations. The bill is endorsed by a growing number of Veterans and mental health advocates, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), American Veterans (AMVETS), National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Volunteers of America (VOA), American Psychological Association (APA), and American Association of Suicidology. ###","Cold weather to grip WORLD as solar minimum to DEEPEN, NASA says",partially false

66f5e596,"MINSK, September 18. /TASS/. Kiev’s representatives have refused to sign the so-called Steinmeier formula at a meeting in Minsk on Wednesday, putting plans to hold a Normandy Four summit at risk of failure, a source familiar with talks within the Contact Group on resolving the Donbass conflict told TASS. The Contact Group’s meeting was focused on the agreements that the aides to the leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine had reached during recent consultations in Berlin, which particularly stipulated that a document on the implementation of the ‘Steinmeier formula’ be signed at today’s meeting so that the disengagement of forces may begin near the Petrovskoye and Zolotoye settlements, the source said. However, the Ukrainian delegation refused to sign the document, putting preparations for a Normandy Four summit at risk of failure, he added. In late 2015, then German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier put forward a plan that later became known as the Steinmeier formula. The plan stipulates that special status be granted to Donbass in accordance with the Minsk Agreements. In particular, the document envisages that Ukraine’s special law on local self-governance will take effect in certain areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions on a temporary basis on the day of local elections, becoming permanent after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE publishes a report on the vote’s results.

8.51E+81,"For years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter. Now, however, facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election. New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he’s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote. New Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes. Now there’s proof. According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver’s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn’t prove that any fraud occurred – theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver’s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license. So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver’s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017 – nearly ten months after the election – only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver’s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State. 5,513 is a big number – more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That’s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds. It’s also possible that New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well. If the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result. And that is already having consequences for the nation. If the 52-48 Republican-Democrat balance in the Senate were 53-47, it could change the balance in any number of votes – not the least of which would be the effort to repeal Obamacare.

3971d0e8,"HOUSTON — In the weeks since President Obama’s re-election, Republicans around the country have been wondering how to proceed. Some conservatives in Texas have been asking a far more pointed question: how to secede. Secession fever has struck parts of Texas, which Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes. Sales of bumper stickers reading “Secede” — one for $2, or three for $5 — have increased at TexasSecede.com. In East Texas, a Republican official sent out an e-mail newsletter saying it was time for Texas and Vermont to each “go her own way in peace” and sign a free-trade agreement among the states. A petition calling for secession that was filed by a Texas man on a White House Web site has received tens of thousands of signatures, and the Obama administration must now issue a response. And Larry Scott Kilgore, a perennial Republican candidate from Arlington, a Dallas suburb, announced that he was running for governor in 2014 and would legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore, with Secede in capital letters. As his Web page, secedekilgore.com, puts it: “Secession! All other issues can be dealt with later.” In Texas, talk of secession in recent years has steadily shifted to the center from the fringe right. It has emerged as an echo of the state Republican leadership’s anti-Washington, pro-Texas-sovereignty mantra on a variety of issues, including health care and environmental regulations. For some Texans, the renewed interest in the subject serves simply as comic relief after a crushing election defeat.",Ex-ambassador McFaul switches to Russian to celebrate midterm victory over…Putin,FALSE
ffc3b1c8,"Nir Shaviv is an Israeli astrophysicist and chairman of Jerusalem’s Hebrew University’s physics department. He says that his research, and that of colleagues, suggests that rising CO2 levels play only a minor role in earth’s climate compared to the influence of the sun and cosmic radiation.,“Global warming clearly is a problem, though not in the catastrophic terms of Al Gore’s movies or environmental alarmists,” said Shaviv. “Climate change has existed forever and is unlikely to go away. But CO2 emissions don’t play the major role. Periodic solar activity does.” But I thought that 97% of climate scientists agreed that human activity is the main driver of climate change? “Only people who don’t understand science take the 97% statistic seriously,” said Shaviv. “Survey results depend on who you ask, who answers and how the questions are worded. In any case, science is not a democracy. Even if 100% of scientists believe something, one person with good evidence can still be right.” And for anyone attempting to dismiss Shaviv’s credentials?
Well, he enrolled at Israel’s Technion University – the country’s equivalent of MIT – at the age of 13 and earned an MA while serving in the Israel Defense Force’s celebrated 8200 Intelligence unit. He returned to Technion, where he earned his doctorate, afterward completing post-doctoral work at California Institute of Technology and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. He also has been an Einstein Fellow at The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton — we’re told to listen to the scientists, right?
But what about Shaviv’s supposed political agenda, he’s been corrupted from that angle, right? “In American terms, I would describe myself as liberal on most domestic issues, somewhat hawkish on security,” Shaviv explained. “Nonetheless, the Trump administration’s position on global climate change is correct insofar as it rejects the orthodoxy of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). “Since [2003], literally billions have been spent on climate research,” Shaviv added. Yet, “the conventional wisdom hasn’t changed. The proponents of man-made climate change still ignore the effect of the sun on the earth’s climate, which overturns our understanding of twentieth-century climate change.” He explained: “Solar activity varies over time. A major variation is roughly eleven years or more, which clearly affects climate. This principle has been generally known – but in 2008 I was able to quantify it by using sea level data. When the sun is more active, there is a rise in sea level here on earth. Higher temperature makes water expand. When the sun is less active, temperature goes down and the sea level falls – the correlation is as clear as day. “Based on the increase of solar activity during the twentieth century, it should account for between half to two-thirds of all climate change,” he said. “That, in turn, implies that climate sensitivity to CO2 should be about 1.0 degree when the amount of CO2 doubles.” The link between solar activity and the heating and cooling of the earth is indirect, he explained. Galactic Cosmic Rays are a mixture of high-energy photons and sub-atomic particles accelerated toward Earth by supernova explosions and other violent events in the cosmos. Solar Cosmic Rays are the same, though their source is the sun. Both Galactic and Solar Cosmic rays hitting Earth’s atmosphere create aerosols which, in turn, seed clouds (Svensmark et al) — making them a crucial player in earth’s weather and climate. During solar minimum, like the one we’re entering now, the sun’s magnetic field weakens and the outward pressure of the solar wind decreases. This allows more cosmic rays from deep space to penetrate our planet’s atmosphere and nucleate more clouds. “Clouds are the Earth’s sunshade, and if cloud cover changes for any reason, you have global warming — or global cooling.” — Roy W. Spencer Ph.D. “Today we can demonstrate and prove the sun’s effect on climate based on a wide range of evidence, from fossils that are hundreds of millions of years old to buoy readings to satellite altimetry data from the past few decades,” Shaviv explained. “We also can reproduce and mimic atmospheric conditions in the laboratory to confirm the evidence. “All of it shows the same thing, the bulk of climate change is caused by the sun via its impact on atmospheric charge, which means that most of the warming comes from nature — a freshman physics student can see this. “Our findings are very inconvenient for conventional wisdom. We know that there have been very large variations of climate in the past that have little to do with the burning of fossil fuels. A thousand years ago the earth was as warm as it is today. During the Little Ice Age three hundred years ago the River Thames froze more often. In the first and second IPCC reports these events were mentioned. In 2001 they disappeared. Suddenly no mention of natural warming, no Little Ice Age. The climate of the last millennium was presented as basically fixed until the twentieth century. This is a kind of Orwellian cherry-picking to fit a pre-determined narrative.” Shaviv says that he has accepted no financial support for his research from the fossil fuel industry. “The real problem is funding from funding agencies like the National Science Foundation because these proposals have to undergo review by people in a community that ostracizes us,” he said, because of his non-conventional viewpoint. “Global warming is not a purely scientific issue any more,” he said. “It has repercussions for society. It has also taken on a moralistic, almost religious quality. If you believe what everyone believes, you are a good person. If you don’t, you are a bad person. Who wants to be a sinner?” In Shaviv’s view, the worldwide crusade to limit and eventually ban fossil fuels “comes with real world social and economic consequences.” Switching to more costly energy sources will drive industry from more industrialized countries to poorer countries that can less afford wind turbines and solar panels. “It may be a financial sacrifice the rich are willing to make,” Shaviv added. “Even in developed countries the pressure to forego fossil fuel puts poor people in danger of freezing during the winter for lack of affordable home heating. The economic growth of third world countries will be inhibited if they cannot borrow from the World Bank to develop cheap fossil-based power plants. These are serious human problems in the here and now, not in a theoretical future.” And unfortunately the cold times are returning, in line with historically low solar activity. Even NASA agrees, in part at least, with their SC25 forecast revealing it will be “the weakest of the past 200 years”: The time to prepare is now.","ACCLAIMED ISRAELI ASTROPHYSICIST SUGGESTS THE SUN DRIVES EARTH’S CLIMATE, NOT CO2",FALSE

a9994f18,"A South African pastor, Alfred Ndlovu has died of malnutrition after going without food for 30 days when he tried to emulate Jesus Christ and fast for 40 days and 40 nights. Buzz South Africa reports that the 44-year-old pastor left home on June 17 for a nearby bush to have prayers, just like Jesus did. Attempting to equal or break Jesus Christ record of fasting for 40 days, Mr Alfred Ndlovu died just a month despite having no history of illness. He was alone in the wilderness and his body was found by a stranger who then called the police. He was known by his family and community at large as a very spiritual person whose faith could move mountains and his death surprised everyone, even church members. One close relative said: ‘He was a very spiritual man. It’s unfortunate he had to die this way. After a month we got the sad news of his death. The pastor was a healthy and religious old man who did not even look his age.",Joy Covey: Amazon pioneer and high tech rock star dead at 50 in Woodside bike crash,other
c37a4008,"This morning, millions awoke to the news that the UK had voted in favour of a Brexit. But analysis of Internet searches made in the small hours revealed many people may not have known exactly what they were voting for in the EU referendum. Google Trends recorded a huge spike in the number of people asking ‘What happens if we leave the EU?’, after the polls had closed. Google Trends recorded a huge spike in the number of people asking ‘What happens if we leave the EU?’, after the polls had closed (pictured) UNCERTAIN BRITS TAKE TO GOOGLE The analytics arm of Californian search giant Google recorded a huge spike in the numbers of Brits querying the fallout of yesterday's EU referendum vote. Google Trends recorded a spike in the number of people asking ‘What happens if we leave the EU?’, after the polls had closed. However, the search term was relatively flat in the week running up to the vote. Advertisement Early this morning, the analytics arm of the search giant said it had seen a huge jump in the search term. However, analysis shows the question only started to rise as the polls were closing and had been relatively flat in the week running up to the vote. On Twitter, Google Trends wrote: ‘+250 per cent spike in ‘what happens if we leave the EU’ in the past hour’. The search result is expected given the complex arrangement of the EU, with many keen to know how agreements affecting trade and the UK's commitments as a member state will be unpicked as the UK leaves. In the weeks and months running up to the vote, many criticised the deluge of information coming from the opposing camps, as well as industry leaders, economists, scientists and celebrities all voicing their support. At the start of the month, Conservative MP and 'vote leave' advocate Michael Gove said: 'I think people in this country have had enough of experts,' speaking in response to the claims of a expert consensus cited by the 'remain' campaign. The results of the referendum showed 51.9% of UK voters opted to leave the EU. But analysis of search trends in the run up to the vote provide an insight into widepsread confusion among voters Earlier this month, Google released data showing the terms Brits were searching for in the run up to the referendum, revealing ‘immigration’ and ‘NHS’ topping the list. The data, which covered searches over a seven day period from 31st May to 7th June, provided a glimpse into what concerned people across the UK most, but belied a sense of general confusion. +250% spike in ""what happens if we leave the EU"" in the past hourhttps://t.co/9b1d6Bsx6D — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016 With so many conflicting points on such a complex issue, the data show many Brits are simply seeking a straight answer, searching for ‘Why should we leave/stay in the EU?’, followed closely by ‘What will happen if…?’. Google Trends recorded a spike in activity in people searching for 'What happens if we leave the EU?' after the polls had closed But in the week leading up to the vote this activity was largely flat But the top question across the UK concerning the EU referendum is ‘What is ‘Brexit’?’ referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU. The initial fallout from the referendum has shown a drop in the value of Sterling, with more than £100 billion wiped from the FTSE 100 this morning as stock markets reacted to the result. Prime Minister David Cameron has also announced he will be stepping down following the defeat of the remain campaign. But beyond these initial events, it could take a while for the full scale of the UK's decision to become apparent. Earlier in the month, the top search terms were immigration, NHS, economy, sovereignty and national security. But the question most people across the UK were asking was ‘What is ‘Brexit’?’, referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU (pictured) An interactive heat map of search terms in the run up to the referendum showed more people were searching for ‘leave’ in built up metropolitan areas (pictured) Search analysis in the run up to the vote revealed that more people were searching for 'leave' in metropolitan areas, but rather than an indication of voter preference, it could have been explained by people searching for the more information into the potential impact of a British exit from the EU. The final count of the UK vote showed 72.2 per cent of the population cast their vote, with 51.9 per cent voting to leave the EU. A total of 48.1 per cent of voters opted to remain in the EU, with the greatest proportion in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.","Re: Trans-Pecos Pipeline, LLC Presidio Crossing Pmject FERC Docket No. CP15- -000",partially false
7959c212,garlic proven 100 times more effective than antibiotics,"The American Medical Association has been adamantly against hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic for COVID for the past year. Just a few days before the presidential election they reversed course, reversing their opposition. Did they suddenly realize HCQ might have benefit in certain patient groups or were they lying for the past year? How many individuals died as a result of being denied potential lifesaving treatment? The AMA is synonymous with organized medicine, despite myriad specialty societies that may better represent the needs of its member physicians. In fact, only 12 percent of practicing physicians belong to the AMA due to concerns that the AMA is more interested in its own finances and politics than the concerns of doctors. When the AMA talks, media and the public listen, due to their perceived clout. Last spring, the AMA issued a statement critical of hydroxychloroquine as it was being used off-label in the treatment of COVID, not FDA-approved for this purpose with supposed “dangerous side effects.” Quietly at the end of October, the AMA issued a new statement, conveniently overlooked by the media, giving the green light to doctors prescribing HCQ to their COVID patients. What changed since last spring? How many COVID deaths could have been prevented if doctors, using their professional and clinical judgement, could have prescribed HCQ without fear of ostracization or loss of their jobs? HCQ has been around since the 1950s, approved as a malarial preventative and for treatment of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It is relatively safe, except for the one in a thousand with a rare cardiac arrhythmia, easily identified by a pretreatment EKG. In many African countries, HCQ is available without a prescription for malaria prevention. The problem arose when President Trump touted HCQ as a “potential therapeutic,” based on early reports of doctors prescribing it with good results. He did not tell anyone to take it but held it out as hope to a country suffering under a pandemic with lockdowns, quarantines, hospitalizations, and deaths. Trump also took HCQ himself, prescribed by the White House medical team. If Trump claimed drinking water was healthy, the media and medical establishment would have denounced it, citing cases of people dying from drinking too much water. A perfect example was Fox News crank Neil Cavuto screaming how hydroxy “will kill you.” This was based on a flawed VA study finding no benefit for HCQ in a severely ill cohort of patients, and a higher death rate among those receiving HCQ. This was a retrospective study which did not address the possibility that HCQ was given to sicker patients, who were more likely to die anyway. Prestigious medical journals, Lancet and New England Journal, retracted published studies raising alarms about HCQ due to bogus study data. It seemed there was a jihad against HCQ from the medical establishment, supported by the media, simply because the Orange Man suggested it. Was the concern solely over off-label use of drugs? In my world, Avastin has been successfully used off-label for 15 years for the treatment of macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, despite FDA approval only for cancer and a black box warning about gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing, and hemorrhage. In relative terms, HCQ is a far safer drug compared to Avastin. Ketamine is another old drug similar to HCQ, FDA-approved in 1970 as a general anesthetic. Yet it is increasingly being used off-label to treat severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As a general anesthetic, it certainly can kill you if used improperly, but used under the considered judgment of a physician, it can literally save lives. Neil Cavuto hasn’t yet offered his expert medical opinion on ketamine. There have been 187 hydroxy studies, 122 of which were peer-reviewed. 100 percent of these studies reported positive effects for early treatment of COVID, meaning, for those not yet in the hospital, and certainly not on a ventilator. These studies were performed and reported this year, while the AMA stayed mum, standing by their admonition against HCQ, until their “oh by the way” report at the end of October. The AMA’s about-face is curious in terms of timing. They could have tempered their initial remarks last summer, when the “America’s Frontline Doctors” group was promoting HCQ, azithromycin, and zinc as an effective early treatment for COVID. All three components of their cocktail were off label. In fact, at the time there was no approved therapeutic for COVID and many people could have been treated earlier, potentially keeping them out of the hospital or worse. Perfect is the enemy of good. Prospective randomized clinical trials would have been great, but they take time. Why not let physicians use their “best clinical judgment” as the recent AMA statement recommends? Instead, the AMA waited until Oct. 30 to announce a more reasoned position, not coincidently just a few days before the presidential election. Democrats and the media blamed Trump for every COVID illness and death, accusing Trump of “misleading” on HCQ, as a prominent campaign issue. The timing suggests political scheming by the AMA, withholding important information or opinions in an attempt to influence an election. Will the AMA explain this curious timing? Social and corporate media did something similar with Hunter Biden’s laptop, knowingly suppressing information before the election, which may have swayed voters, glibly reporting on it after the election. We will never know how many individuals could have been kept out of the hospital, ICU, or morgue if HCQ was used early in the disease course. Most medical miracles are due to outside the box thinking, using an approved drug in a new way. That’s the scientific approach, weighing risks and benefits, marching forward with modifications based on early results. Instead, the AMA threw cold water on HCQ, joined by a medical establishment and media eager to ruin physicians’ careers if they challenged the dogma and dared promote HCQ. The AMA played footloose with science and the truth. Some may call that lying and all for political purposes. Meanwhile people died. All to influence an election and depose the tweeting Orange Man in the White House",partially false
48eec6b0,"The number of white suspected terrorists being arrested in the UK has overtaken those of Asian appearance for the first time in more than a decade. Statistics released by the Home Office show an overall fall in terror arrests of 22 per cent in the year, with 351 made in the 12 months to the end of June. “The fall is partly due to a relatively large number of arrests being made following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester last year,” a report said. White suspects accounted for 38 per cent of terror-related arrests, followed by those of Asian appearance on 37 per cent and black suspects on 9 per cent. “This was the first time, since the year ending June 2005, that the proportion of white people arrested has exceeded the proportion of Asian people arrested,” the report said. “It was the second highest number of arrests of white people in a year since the data collection began in 2001.” The demographics of terrorists in prison, where Islamists make up the majority, is also changing, as the number of far-right extremists jailed rises.

Read our privacy notice The Home Office said: “The number of Islamist, extremist prisoners saw a slight decrease for the first time. ✕ Isis fighters in Afghanistan are communicating with UK terror cells, defence secretary Gavin Williamson says “The proportion of prisoners holding far-right ideologies has increased steadily over the past three years, with the number up from 10 to 28 in the latest year.” Terror arrests have risen significantly since Isis declared its so-called “state” across Syria and Iraq, causing at least 900 people to leave the UK for its territories and others, who remained in the country, arrested for raising money for the group, spreading its propaganda and planning to commit attacks. Then in 2016, National Action became the first far-right group to ever be declared a terrorist organisation in the UK, with waves of police raids targeting the neo-Nazis. Experts have warned of the threat of “reciprocal radicalisation”, where Islamists and the far-right feed off each other to drive support to their own ideologies. Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, security services have foiled 13 Islamist plots and four from the extreme right-wing, seeing numerous would-be killers jailed. Of the five attacks launched in London and Manchester last year, leaving a total of 36 victims dead, Isis claimed responsibility for four and one was carried out by a far-right extremist targeting Muslims. Islamists make up 82 per cent of terrorist prisoners, followed by 13 per cent far-right and the rest made up of other ideologies including links to Northern Ireland. Police leaders said the past year saw highest number of terrorists tried and successfully convicted, since data collection began in 2009. Life sentences were handed out in 10 cases, including for the men who mounted the Finsbury Park and Parsons Green terror attacks.

The number of active investigations being carried out by specialist police and the security services has reached it’s highest ever level, currently standing at more than 650 probes focusing on the “most dangerous individuals”. “Demands upon CT Policing have increased by about a third since the start of 2017,” said deputy assistant commissioner Haydon. “The step-change in terrorist activity is matched only by an increased effort from police and security services, and our officers are working incredibly hard to protect the public and to bring people to justice, which is evidenced by the impressive conviction rate achieved in the last year. “But I would also like to use this opportunity to remind the public that they, too, play a part in these successes. “Many of these arrests, convictions and investigations hinge upon vital information provided by members of the public.” The figures came as the government consults on new terror laws contained in the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Bill. If enacted, it could spark a dramatic increase in terror arrests, which are currently being made under two Terrorism Acts, by introducing new crimes. They include viewing terrorist propaganda online just once, entering “designated areas” abroad, and making “reckless” statements that could drive support for a banned group.

The March-May and year-to-date global temperatures were also the fourth warmest such periods on record.This monthly summary, developed by scientists at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making. May 2018 Temperature The May temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.44°F above the 20th century average of 58.6°F and the fourth highest for May in the 1880-2018 record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.58°F above average. May 2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average. Record warmth was observed across parts of North America., Europe and Asia as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Record cold May temperatures were limited to northeastern Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean, off the southern coast of Greenland. The May globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.05°F above the 20th century average of 52.0°F. This value was the smallest May temperature departure from average since 2011 and tied with 2013 as the seventh highest May land temperature in the 139-year record. The most notable warm land temperature departures from average during May 2018 were present across much of the contiguous U.S. and Europe, where temperatures were 5.4°F above average or higher. In contrast, the most notable cool land temperature departures from average were present across northeastern Canada and central Russia where temperatures were 5.4°F below average or lower. Europe had its warmest May since continental records began in 1910 at 4.97°F above average, surpassing the previous record set in 2003 by 1.66°F. May 2018 marked the first time in May that the continental temperature departure from average was 3.6°F (2.0°C) or higher. Several European countries had a record or near-record warm May temperature. Asia had its smallest May temperature departure from average since 2009. The May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.19°F above the 20th century monthly average of 61.3°F – also the fourth highest global ocean temperature for May in the record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.39°F above average. May 2018 Sea Ice. The May average Arctic sea ice extent was the second smallest in the 40-year record at 420,000 square miles (8.1 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, according to an analysis by the National Snow and Ice Data Center(link is external) using data from NOAA and NASA. Only the May Arctic sea ice extent in 2016 was smaller. The near-record low Arctic sea ice extent was mostly due to much-below-average sea ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Antarctic sea ice extent during May was 330,000 square miles (8.6 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, the third smallest May extent on record. Antarctic sea ice expanded at a rate faster than average during May, with below-average ice coverage continuing for parts of the Weddell Sea. Seasonal (March-May 2018). The March-May average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.48°F above the 20th century average of 56.7°F and the fourth highest for March-May in the 1880-2018 record. This value was 0.45°F cooler than the record high set in 2016 and was the smallest March-May temperature departure from average since 2014. Record warm temperatures during the three-month period were present across parts of southern Europe, the Middle East, northeastern Africa, China, Mongolia, South America and the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. No land or ocean areas had record cold temperatures during March-May 2018. The globally averaged land surface temperature for March-May was 2.34°F above the 20th century average of 46.4°F. This value was the the fifth highest for March-May in the 139-year record. Five continents had a March-May 2018 temperature that ranked among the nine warmest such period since continental records began in 1910. Of note, Europe and South America had their third warmest March-May on record. The March-May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.15°F above the 20th century average of 61.0°F – also the fourth highest for March-May in the record. Year-to-Date (January-May 2018). The year-to-date temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.39°F above the 20th century average of 55.5°F – tying with 2010 as the fourth highest for January-May in the 139-year record. The 2018 year-to-date value was 0.59°F lower than the record high set in 2016. The year-to-date globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.18°F above the 20th century average of 42.8°F. This value tied with 2002 as the fifth highest for January-May in the record. The year-to-date globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.08°F above the 20th century average of 60.8°F.

53eabb9b,"Trade agreements and pressure on India’s ‘pharmacy of the developing world’ pose major threats to access Durban, 21 July 2016 — The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières today released the 18th edition of its HIV drug pricing report, Untangling the Web of Antiretroviral Price Reductions, at the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa. The report finds that prices of older HIV drugs continue to decline, while newer drugs remain largely priced out of reach. This is in large part because pharmaceutical corporations maintain monopolies that block price-lowering generic competition. Today, the lowest available price for a quality-assured, World Health Organization-recommended first-line one-pill-a-day combination is US$100 per person per year (tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz). This is a decrease of 26% since MSF last recorded the lowest price for first-line treatment at $136 in 2014. For a WHO-recommended second-line regimen, the lowest available price is now $286 per person per year (zidovudine/lamivudine + atazanavir/ritonavir)—an 11% decrease from $322 two years ago. These prices continue to fall as a result of robust competition among generics manufacturers in key producing countries, primarily India. But the price of newer drugs—needed for people who have run out of other HIV treatment options—remain high, largely because of patent monopolies held by drug corporations. The lowest price for salvage treatment today is $1,859 per person per year (raltegravir + darunavir/ritonavir + etravirine). This is more than 18 times the price of first-line therapy, and more than six times the price of today’s most affordable second-line combination. The price for this combination has come down only by seven percent, from $2,006 per year in 2014. These are the lowest global prices, but many countries, especially ‘middle-income’ countries, pay much higher prices for these medicines because pharmaceutical patents block them from using generics. "" the price of newer drugs—needed for people who have run out of other HIV treatment options—remain high, largely because of patent monopolies held by drug corporations."" “We have to be able to afford the newer HIV drug combinations that people will need over time, or else they will have no other options,” said Dr. Vivian Cox, Medical Referent for MSF’s Eshowe project in South Africa “We need to be shouting about this now to make sure we don’t end up with another treatment crisis like the one we faced over a decade ago, when life-saving medicines were simply priced out of reach for millions of people who needed them.” While today the number of people who require salvage therapy is still relatively small in developing countries, the increased use of gold-standard viral load treatment monitoring is helping identify more people who are failing on their first- or second-line treatment and need to be switched to another set of medicines. Already in MSF’s HIV programmes, the number of people having moved to second-line therapy has almost doubled since 2013. India, the world’s main producer of affordable HIV medicines, is often called the ‘pharmacy of the developing world.’ More than 97% of the HIV medicines MSF uses in its treatment programmes are generic medicines from India. India’s patent law sets a high bar for what deserves a patent. This allows robust competition among generic producers, which has driven down first-line HIV treatment prices by 99% -- from $10,000 per person per year in 2000, to $100 today. But India is facing immense pressure to roll back its pro-health patent policies—which put people’s lives over corporate profits—especially from the United States, backed by its pharmaceutical corporation lobby. Other countries, such as the EU, along with Japan and South Korea, are preparing or actively pursuing trade agreements with India that would restrict the country’s production of affordable medicines in the future. Should India be forced to change its policies for these trade agreements, it could pose a serious threat to affordable medicines production in India. “India is under massive pressure to turn off its tap of affordable medicines, which are a lifeline to millions of people not only in India, but across the developing world,” said Leena Menghaney, South Asia Head of MSF’s Access Campaign. “If India doesn’t stand strong against the pharmaceutical corporations and governments that are pushing for change in the country’s patent law and policies, people around the world will face a crisis in access to medicines in the future.

83c0b379,"A Nasa scientist has said a current slowdown in sunspot activity could cause temperatures in the upper layer of our atmosphere to plummet. Other researchers have previously warned that the lack of sunspots could herald the arrival of a uniquely grim ‘mini Ice Age’. But the Nasa scientist went on to say that the trend he sees is overall global warming, not cooling, and insisted this ‘solar minimum’ does not mean the world is going to shiver through a depressingly long winter. ‘We see a cooling trend,’ Martin Mlynczak of Nasa’s Langley Research Center told Space Weather. ‘High above Earth’s surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy. ‘If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for cold.’ Advertisement Advertisement ‘It could happen in a matter of months,’ Mlynczak added. Sunspot activity follows a cycle which is believed to last 11 years as the number of patches peaks and drops. There have been very few spots on the sun for most of this year. An image taken earlier this year showing the surface of our star without sunspots (Picture: Nasa) MORE : Hackers will ‘take down the internet in 2019’ Earlier this year, Nasa released a picture showing the blank face of the sun looking more like a snooker ball than the roiling surface of a super-hot star. The sun is predicted to reach its solar minimum in 2019 or 2020, according to Nasa’s calculations. Perhaps the most famous period of low sunspot activity was the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century. During that time, there was a ‘little ice age’ when the Thames froze over, although researchers believe that global warming will stop this happening again. Solar minimum may enhance the effects of space weather, disrupt communications and navigation, and even cause space junk to ‘hang around’, Nasa said. MORE : An asteroid will ‘inevitably’ hit Earth and have a ‘calamitous’ effect on humanity, scientist warns Last year, a scientist claimed the chilling effect on the lack of sunspots could actually save us from global warming – although her claims were hotly disputed. Valentina Zharkova, a professor of mathematics at Northumbria University, published a paper which contains ‘the first serious prediction of a reduction of solar activity that might affect human lives’. ‘I hope global warming will be overridden by this effect, giving humankind and the Earth 30 years to sort out our pollution,’ she said. Advertisement Advertisement Michael Brown, an associate professor of astronomy at Monash University in Australia, said the Maunder Minimum could have been caused by other factors including the eruptions of volcanos.

NASA and other climate researchers continue to see a warming trend in the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere closest to Earth’s surface. ‘There is no inconsistency between the science findings of a warming troposphere [where we live] and the Thermosphere Climate Index.’ Update: This article has been amended since initial publication to remove the erroneous suggestion that the possibly record-breaking cooling of the thermosphere, located over 100km above the surface of the Earth, would have the effect on the troposphere of ‘a mini Ice Age’. We are happy to clarify that the record low temperatures reported as part of a natural cycle in solar activity are not inconsistent with current scientific findings of a warming troposphere, and apologise for any contrary impression given.

7bd6ae1e,"The optics seem good. A white man in a Midwestern, purple state managed beat a ridiculously liberal female opponent for executive office whose proxy warriors outspent him three to one. That currently looks like the 2016 lineup. So what’s not to love about Wisconsin’s Scott Walker versus Hillary Clinton in 2016? A lot. This born-and-raised Wisconsin farmgirl has watched Walker closely. He’s been a welcome change compared to his predecessor, Jim Doyle, but Oscar the Grouch would have improved upon Doyle. Hell, PeeWee Herman would have. So far, Walker’s biggest strength is the ability to stand still amid an onslaught. That’s a good start, but it’s not anywhere close to good enough for the next president of a United States awash in debt, regulated and taxed to sclerosis, over-administrated and under-entrepreneured, beset by Progressives who have carried out much of their “transformation” project, and in the midst of an ongoing family breakdown. Scott Walker can play defense. But the nation needs much more than that. It needs a serious policy offensive, after a serious persuasion offensive. And it’s not clear Walker is up to that task. A Nice Guy Is Good for Prom, Not for President A “nice guy” who took naps every day might have been fine for the 1920s. But America in the new millennium needs another substantive revolutionary, another Washington, Jefferson, or Adams. Not another Calvin Coolidge. There’s some indication Walker will finally get down to brass tacks after having spent his entire first term running to retain his seat: My former classmate Betsy Woodruff reports at Slate that tax cuts and school choice expansions may be next on his agenda. But Walker has been doing a lot of promising and not a lot of carrying through on prominent issues besides standing still while unions self-destruct—including a pitiful 500-student increase to Milwaukee’s voucher program, the nation’s oldest, because Walker couldn’t get his own party members to back a real expansion despite full control of Wisconsin’s legislative and executive branches. Whoop de doo. In Indiana, Mitch Daniels’ voucher program is approaching 30,000 students two years after opening. He knew how to work with his legislature—and they ain’t any less ornery and squish than Wisconsin Republicans. Walker’s tax cuts, a GOP oldie but goodie, are likewise welcome but also currently more of a middling measure. See the discussion of that below. In short, we’ll know Walker’s serious when he starts actually cutting agencies and programs. Starve the beast works fine if you like neverending debt bombs, as everyone learned post-Reagan. Hillary Clinton Is No Mary Burke Let’s just say it: Walker’s opponent, Mary Burke, was a weak candidate. She had very little political experience, and her business experience turned out to demonstrate her incompetence and enjoyment of nepotism more than anything. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is nothing if not a political phoenix. She’s crafty, and she’s been around all the ponds ten times longer than Scott Walker and just about anyone else. She’s a cougar, and cougars survive. That doesn’t mean Clinton has no weaknesses. She has plenty. But taking her (or any Democratic nominee) on will be an entirely different and far more difficult fight than Walker against Burke, and Walker against unions who trashed the state capitol in full view of God and everybody. If and when Walker pulls ahead of the GOP pack—and his head is far enough out at this moment to be quite noticeable—his tactics, personality, family, everything will be scrutinized by an army of highly intelligent, adaptive robots. Democrats may have overplayed their hand this time. The likelihood of that happening again soon is slim, especially under a very controlled Hillary Clinton’s watch. Similar arguments apply if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee. National politics is an astronomically different ballgame than going after someone whose major qualification is her position on a local school board. And the optics will be key. Even in Wisconsin, friends who campaigned for Walker met voters who went for Burke “because she is a woman.” It’s stupid, but we can’t institute a poll test now. Unions Had to Make Their Last Stand Somewhere Let’s also look at what got Walker onto unions’ hit list. He signed a bill restricting collective bargaining to salaries only for all government employees except State Patrol officers and ending the state’s involvement with collecting dues for unions. It’s basically a hedged right-to-work law. Nearly all red states already have right-to-work laws; but Walker’s team apparently felt that was a bridge too far. In fact, Indiana passed a genuine right-to-work law right around the same time, but unions had been neutered in that state already so liberals seemed mostly content to give it up for dead while focusing their fury at a lesser measure in purple Wisconsin. Walker made a restrained move in a time and place that was good for unions to pick a fight for one of what will certainly be many last stands. Basically, Walker made a restrained move in a time and place that was good for unions to pick a fight for one of what will certainly be many last stands. Union membership is almost entirely a government-employee phenomenon in the United States, because private businesses are too busy paying the world’s highest corporate tax rate to have any left over for padding workers’ salaries. Oh, and government can’t go out of business. Now, the largest field containing government employees is education. There’s about half a million more public-school teachers in this country than there are federal employees. So the largest category of unionized employees in this country are teachers. And teachers unions are themselves expecting to lose hundreds of thousands of members, and with those members, millions of dollars in revenue. Losing money means losing political power. Money are power are the two reasons unions exist. So they must viciously fight their slide into extinction. Thus, the union circus entered Wisconsin in 2010. They’re fighting for survival. Even if they fight, they may lose, but if they don’t, they surely will. The fury in Madison had little to do with Scott Walker, and much to do with a union existential crisis that predated him. Scott Walker Already Flirts With Sacrificing Principles for Votes Walker has been aiming for the presidency ever since winning his recall, so especially given his slightly weird (but entirely American) religious feelings about being a sort of political anointed one, I think he definitely throws his hat into the ring after his win. Men ballsy enough to think they should be governor and surrounded by backslapping donors who are overreacting because they’re tired of years of conservatives being trodden underfoot in the humble Midwest definitely have a big enough head to think they can win the presidency. No George Washingtons in the crop of presidential hopefuls anymore, that’s for sure, despite our country’s great need for such men. Since turning his eyes toward Washington, Walker has gone soft on many core issues. Here’s one: Marriage. As the Daily Caller reported a few weeks ago: Around March of 2013, Walker started suggesting that opposition to gay marriage was “generational,” and that it was wiser for Republicans to focus on economic issues. And just this week, after the Supreme Court decided not to weigh in on on the decision striking down Wisconsin’s gay marriage ban, his administration announced they would recognize same sex marriages, going back to June. The man now famous for standing also stands down when it seems politically expedient to do so. Okay, well, marriage has few supporters, even in the GOP, so let’s pretend that’s not important. How about abortion? Yes, Walker got soft on abortion back when it looked like Burke had him pinned to the wall, talking up his support for a bill that “leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.” I wonder if he’d define “pro-life” as “no advocate for the baby need be in the room.” Explicitly, no. Now, I understand that polls are currently against preserving marriage (and it’s sad that polls will determine a politician’s convictions, but that’s the game). But something like three-quarters of Americans look askance at abortion. There’s no need to use pro-death catchphrases. Running for President Demands a Substantive Record Let’s, see, what else has this guy done worth talking up? Well, he balanced a mess of a state budget his predecessor handed him (see “PeeWee Herman,” above). Decent, although state debt is still quite high. Walker also ran touting his record on reducing Wisconsin taxes. And, as the daughter of a farmer who’s paid for hundreds of kids to get a substandard education, I thank him for caring that Wisconsin’s tax burden is insane. A colleague who lives in Chicago and has a Wisconsin summer home keeps his residence in Chicago because the Illinois taxes are lower. I know the owner of a large business who built an expansion on the Illinois side of the state line for the same reason. Even including data from Walker’s tenure, though, Wisconsin today still has the highest tax burden in the Midwest by a long shot, after Minnesota and Illinois. Rah, rah ‘skulls of my enemies’ man-whooping may be fun after the first election Republicans have performed decently in God knows how long, but nobody intelligent makes serious decisions until the morning, when sober. And let’s not even mention Walker’s somewhat silly promise of 250,000 more jobs in Wisconsin after his first term (the actual net gain was about half as much). Rounding error. Hm, wait, no, rounding 44 percent to the nearest hundredth would have to be down, to zero… Neither shall we spend much time on Walker’s horrific mismanagement of Common Core after studiously attempting to avoid his constituents’ barrage of pleas for their hero save them from this monstrosity. He’s willing to make public statements demanding an end to Common Core in Wisconsin (or, at least the name!). But he’s so far not spent a sliver of political capital on the issue, instead relegating it, like the school vouchers he claims to be so fond of, to the state superintendent, who may be fairly characterized as the most ardent foe of vouchers and the most ardent lover of Common Core. After all, Superintendent Tony Evers signed Common Core into de facto Wisconsin law five months before that deformed lovechild of bureaucrats was even brought forth. Walker even agrees with Evers on how voucher schools should be regulated: exactly like public schools, apparently with no thought that using vouchers to assimilate private schools into the government Borg negates the reason for vouchers in the first place. Memo to Wisconsin: Your voucher program is the most regulated in the nation. Maybe deregulate while you expand. In fact, that’s a pretty good motto for many sectors, and primarily business. I know several Wisconsin businessmen well. The amount of compliance they have to go through each week, let alone year, is utterly insane. It chokes their ability to hire and expand. A proactive conservative platform must include deregulation, in every sector. Clear the sapsuckers out. Rah, rah “skulls of my enemies” man-whooping may be fun after the first election Republicans have performed decently in God knows how long, but nobody intelligent makes serious decisions until the morning, when sober. We have seen few proactive accomplishments upon which Walker can build a national platform. Union-bashing really doesn’t matter much to most Americans. And I realize unions have forced Walker to spend his entire term on defense. So maybe he’s got an offensive playbook in some back corner of his brain. Well, now would be the time to bring it out.",Who Broke the Iowa Caucuses and Why Were Results Delayed?,partially false
7957e58e,"“There is a plot to discredit the President and destabilize his government,” a highly placed source in the Office of the President said. “There’s an obvious pattern of close coordination among some media organizations for the timely publication of anti-Duterte stories,” the source told this writer. The playbook is all too familiar: Utilize the media, plant fake news, distribute them to the friendly media outlets, whet the people’s appetite, arouse their anger, manipulate public emotion, touch base with the Leftist organization, enlist the support of the police and the military, then go for the “kill.” That’s how coups are staged. Except that in this instance, there is no discernible support from the police and the military, much less the people. For a coup to succeed, it is critical to have the support of the people. Unfortunately for coup plotters in this country, the people have grown tired and weary of coups. More importantly, various polls have shown that President Rodrigo Duterte still enjoys the overwhelming support of the masses. His ratings have remained in the stratospheric levels for the past three years despite the incessant attacks by the opposition. The Matrix A document provided to The Manila Times over the weekend by the same source shows what appears to be a coordinated media campaign to discredit the President. Under the heading, “Association Matrix Between BIKOY and ELLEN TORDESILLAS,” (all caps supplied), the matrix illustrates the flow of news from the source to a nexus or distributor and finally to the individual journalists for publication. It also names the journalists and organizations involved in the alleged plot to blacken the image of the President. “A group sympathetic to the President and deeply involved in the IT business had tracked the flow of information from its source to its various media assets and decided to provide the information to the President out of concern,” the source said. Media participants in the Oust-Duterte move “Bikoy,” obviously a pseudonym, was the source of the black propaganda, the matrix shows. From Bikoy, the stories go to Ellen Tordesillas, president of Vera Files, who acts as the nexus and distributor of the materials to the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ), Rappler and the National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL). These organizations, in turn, distribute the false narratives to their respective members. (Please refer to the matrix.) Tordesillas also currently serves as a fact-checker for Facebook. The matrix, however, did not disclose the real identity of Bikoy. Save for the NUPL, a leftist group, the rest of the people from Rappler, Vera Files and the PCIJ named in the matrix are members of the media. It would now appear that these journalists are collaborating with the Left in their effort to destabilize the government, the matrix shows. “Wala namang tao na ganoon (referring to Bikoy),” the source said. The series of invented stories against the President was part of the black propaganda campaign by the Yellows, the source added. The opposition couldn’t accept that the ratings of the President remain stratospheric. “Mataas ang credibility ni Presidente.” They could not believe that despite the series of black propaganda campaign against the President, his popularity and trust ratings remain unaffected. Vera Files, the PCIJ and Rappler received largesse from various foreign sources, the source said, without specifying a figure. Plotters desperate Two other independent sources confirmed that there is an active plot to oust the President. It was obvious, they said. For one thing, it is not the duty of the press or the media to be at the forefront of an active campaign to unseat a duly elected President. The role of the press is to inform the public and expose the shenanigans, venalities and corruption in government; but certainly not to participate in any manner or form in any campaign to destabilize the government. The media is supposed to be the purveyors of truth, not an instrument to plot against a sitting President, they added. They said it became particularly vicious when Bikoy in his second video episode of the “Ang Totoong Narcolist” series, accused the President’s 14-year old daughter, Veronica and his partner, Honeylet, of receiving “payoffs from the illegal drug trade and depositing such transactions in banks in Hong Kong.” “Paano nangyari na ‘yung batang edad 14, may gatas pa sa labi, ay tumatanggap na ng suhol sa mga drug lords? Pati ‘yung kanyang ina na nananahimik sa Davao, isinangkot? Laking kabulastugan n’yan,” one of them said, to which the other agreed. Another tall tale was when Bikoy accused erstwhile presidential assistant Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go of receiving kickbacks from the drug lords; that his takes were deposited in four local banks; and that his foreign bank transactions had reached P3.7 billion from 2010 to 2018. The accuser did not offer any shadow of proof to back up his accusations. Bikoy also accused Go of having a dragon tattoo on his back that embedded a code name for alleged drug transactions. Bikoy and his partners in crime went silent after Go bared his back to the public that showed no dragon tattoo. “Ang kinis ng likod ni Bong Go,” an amused observer said. Paid hacks in media Another media practitioner sees malice and ill intent on the part of Ellen Tordesillas when she acted as distributor of the anti-Duterte stories, as the matrix shows. “Normally, a journalist would not share her story with other journalists or media outlets, especially if it is an enterprise or exclusive story. He or she would naturally want to have a scoop.” If it is true that Ellen participated in the distribution of the story — whether that is legitimate or otherwise — at the very least, she will be guilty of unethical practice. And if she was paid for doing so, then she would be nothing more than a paid hack, a cheap propagandist, and therefore, fair game for the administration, he said. The same is true in the case of Vera Files, Rappler and the PCIJ. They appear to have received massive foreign funding, which is against our Constitution, and, therefore, these media outfits cannot claim objectivity. Their critical Duterte stories become suspect. To this date, they have not refuted allegations of foreign funding by our eminent writer, former ambassador Rigoberto Tiglao, in amounts that he said have ranged from $106,000 to $278,000. Tordesillas has been asked to comment on the allegations against her before publication of this article, but the Times has not received a reply by deadline on Sunday.",MH17 case: Kremlin spokesman declines to comment on Tsemakh,FALSE

Ibrahim said the government planned to create an enabling environment for over “30 million Nigerian youths” to utilise the ICT industry to create jobs and transform the economy. The minister stated these on Friday while delivering the 7th Convocation Lecture of Nile University, Abuja. He said, “With an average age of just over 18 years, Nigeria has a potential critical mass of digital natives that can transform the country into a regional and global ICT powerhouse. “With a GDP valued at $397bn, Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa based on the World Bank’s estimate.

The struggle to rein in global carbon emissions and keep the planet from melting down has the feel of Kafka’s fiction. The goal has been clear for thirty years, and despite earnest efforts we’ve made essentially no progress toward reaching it. Today, the scientific evidence verges on irrefutable. If you’re younger than sixty, you have a good chance of witnessing the radical destabilization of life on earth—massive crop failures, apocalyptic fires, imploding economies, epic flooding, hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing regions made uninhabitable by extreme heat or permanent drought. If you’re under thirty, you’re all but guaranteed to witness it. If you care about the planet, and about the people and animals who live on it, there are two ways to think about this. You can keep on hoping that catastrophe is preventable, and feel ever more frustrated or enraged by the world’s inaction. Or you can accept that disaster is coming, and begin to rethink what it means to have hope. Even at this late date, expressions of unrealistic hope continue to abound. Hardly a day seems to pass without my reading that it’s time to “roll up our sleeves” and “save the planet”; that the problem of climate change can be “solved” if we summon the collective will. Although this message was probably still true in 1988, when the science became fully clear, we’ve emitted as much atmospheric carbon in the past thirty years as we did in the previous two centuries of industrialization. The facts have changed, but somehow the message stays the same. Psychologically, this denial makes sense. Despite the outrageous fact that I’ll soon be dead forever, I live in the present, not the future. Given a choice between an alarming abstraction (death) and the reassuring evidence of my senses (breakfast!), my mind prefers to focus on the latter. The planet, too, is still marvelously intact, still basically normal—seasons changing, another election year coming, new comedies on Netflix—and its impending collapse is even harder to wrap my mind around than death. Other kinds of apocalypse, whether religious or thermonuclear or asteroidal, at least have the binary neatness of dying: one moment the world is there, the next moment it’s gone forever. Climate apocalypse, by contrast, is messy. It will take the form of increasingly severe crises compounding chaotically until civilization begins to fray. Things will get very bad, but maybe not too soon, and maybe not for everyone. Maybe not for me. Some of the denial, however, is more willful. The evil of the Republican Party’s position on climate science is well known, but denial is entrenched in progressive politics, too, or at least in its rhetoric. The Green New Deal, the blueprint for some of the most substantial proposals put forth on the issue, is still framed as our last chance to avert catastrophe and save the planet, by way of gargantuan renewable-energy projects. Many of the groups that support those proposals deploy the language of “stopping” climate change, or imply that there’s still time to prevent it. Unlike the political right, the left prides itself on listening to climate scientists, who do indeed allow that catastrophe is theoretically avertable. But not everyone seems to be listening carefully. The stress falls on the word theoretically. Our atmosphere and oceans can absorb only so much heat before climate change, intensified by various feedback loops, spins completely out of control. Some scientists and policymakers fear that we’re in danger of passing this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius (maybe more, but also maybe less). The I.P.C.C.—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—tells us that, to limit the rise to less than two degrees, we not only need to reverse the trend of the past three decades. We need to approach zero net emissions, globally, in the next three decades. This is, to say the least, a tall order. It also assumes that you trust the I.P.C.C.’s calculations. New research, described last month in Scientific American, demonstrates that climate scientists, far from exaggerating the threat of climate change, have underestimated its pace and severity. To project the rise in the global mean temperature, scientists rely on complicated atmospheric modelling. They take a host of variables and run them through supercomputers to generate, say, ten thousand different simulations for the coming century, in order to make a “best” prediction of the rise in temperature. When a scientist predicts a rise of two degrees Celsius, she’s merely naming a number about which she’s very confident: the rise will be at least two degrees. The rise might, in fact, be far higher. As a non-scientist, I do my own kind of modelling. I run various future scenarios through my brain, apply the constraints of human psychology and political reality, take note of the relentless rise in global energy consumption (thus far, the carbon savings provided by renewable energy have been more than offset by consumer demand), and count the scenarios in which collective action averts catastrophe. The scenarios, which I draw from the prescriptions of policymakers and activists, share certain necessary conditions. The first condition is that every one of the world’s major polluting countries institute draconian conservation measures, shut down much of its energy and transportation infrastructure, and completely retool its economy. According to a recent paper in Nature, the carbon emissions from existing global infrastructure, if operated through its normal lifetime, will exceed our entire emissions “allowance”—the further gigatons of carbon that can be released without crossing the threshold of catastrophe. (This estimate does not include the thousands of new energy and transportation projects already planned or under construction.) To stay within that allowance, a top-down intervention needs to happen not only in every country but throughout every country. Making New York City a green utopia will not avail if Texans keep pumping oil and driving pickup trucks. The actions taken by these countries must also be the right ones. Vast sums of government money must be spent without wasting it and without lining the wrong pockets. Here it’s useful to recall the Kafkaesque joke of the European Union’s biofuel mandate, which served to accelerate the deforestation of Indonesia for palm-oil plantations, and the American subsidy of ethanol fuel, which turned out to benefit no one but corn farmers.",Don't kick the kicker: Improving economy beats improving bond rating,FALSE
347530a3,"On Tuesday, radio show host John Fredricks stated that multiple voters in Georgia had called into his show to tell him that they were unable to cast their votes in the Georgia runoff election because they were told the voting machines were malfunctioning. The callers claimed the poll workers told them to put their ballots in a box and they would be scanned later in the day. Keep in mind the malfunctions were reportedly in deep red counties. The comments from Fredricks came during an interview with Steve Bannon on War Room Pandemic. ""Dominion machines in... 3 of the largest Republican precincts...are down...They are told they can't scan their ballots because the machines don't work...The pole workers are saying 'When it's fixed we'll scan it for you'...There's all kinds of red flags,"" said Fredricks. More voters on Twitter also sounded the alarm. “Just voted in Newton County Georgia,"" said one Twitter user. ""Heavy republican district.. When I went to place my printed ballot into the dominion machine, the poll worked said the scanner was broken and someone was coming to fix it, I placed it in the machine slot but not in the scanner."" The voter later followed up, tweeting, “UPDATE. I called @GaRepublicans hotline and the guy said they are already hearing about these types of problems!”

Under normal circumstances I would say that is secure. In GA...I would have found a seat until it was repaired and fed the ballot myself."" The situation in Georgia continues to get more bizarre. Last Wednesday, Georgia’s Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Elections as well as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee gathered to hold a hearing on Georgia's election laws. During the hearing, inventor Jovan Pulitzer stated that he could easily audit Georgia's election results with special techniques that would identify fraudulent ballots. Pulitzer explained how he has “no regard for the smoke and mirrors of how the machines work"" and would be solely focusing on the paper ballots. “I don’t care about the machine,"" he explained. ""I don’t even care about the code that was written in the machine. What I care about is that physical artifact [ballot] and that physical artifact has material differences district to district that should not be there.” Pulitzer shockingly claimed he could analyze 500,000 in just two hours. After his testimony, the Georgia State Senate Judiciary Subcommittee unanimously passed a motion to audit Fulton County’s absentee ballots using Pulitzer's process.

4fdc9e93,"The Brussel Times reports that a new German study exposes how electric vehicles will hardly decrease CO2 emissions in Europe over the coming years, as the introduction of electric vehicles won't lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions from highway traffic. According to the study directed by Christoph Buchal of the University of Cologne, published by the Ifo Institute in Munich last week, electric vehicles have ""significantly higher CO2 emissions than diesel cars."" That is due to the significant amount of energy used in the mining and processing of lithium, cobalt, and manganese, which are critical raw materials for the production of electric car batteries. A battery pack for a Tesla Model 3 pollutes the climate with 11 to 15 tonnes of CO2. Each battery pack has a lifespan of approximately ten years and total mileage of 94,000, would mean 73 to 98 grams of CO2 per kilometer (116 to 156 grams of CO2 per mile), Buchal said. Add to this the CO2 emissions of the electricity from powerplants that power such vehicles, and the actual Tesla emissions could be between 156 to 180 grams of CO2 per kilometer (249 and 289 grams of CO2 per mile). German researchers criticized the fact that EU legislation classifies electric cars as zero-emission cars; they call it a deception because electric cars, like the Model 3, with all the factors, included, produce more emissions than diesel vehicles by Mercedes. They further wrote that the EU target of 59 grams of CO2 per kilometer by 2030 is ""technically unrealistic."" The reality is, in addition to the CO2 emissions generated in mining the raw materials for the production of electric vehicles, all EU countries generate significant CO2 emissions from charging the vehicles’ batteries using dirty power plants. For true emission reductions, researchers concluded the study by saying methane-powered gasoline engines or hydrogen motors could cut CO2 emissions by a third and possibly eliminate the need for diesel motors. ""Methane technology is ideal for the transition from natural gas vehicles with conventional engines to engines that will one day run on methane from CO2-free energy sources. This being the case, the German federal government should treat all technologies equally and promote hydrogen and methane solutions as well.""

What We Know: The Emmett Till memorial was put up by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, and resides outside of Glendale, Mississippi. According to TIME Magazine, this is the third time that the sign has been vandalized. To drive up and see it like that, I was sad,” said Patrick Weems, a founder of the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Miss. “When we finally replaced it, it was an amazing feeling that this sign that had been obliterated was finally restored.” The memorial was placed in honor of 14-year-old Till who was lynched, beaten and tortured by two white men, and then thrown in the Tallahatchie river. He was accused by a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, of whistling at her. The men where acquitted of his murder, and she recanted her story decades later after Till’s death. It was not until 2007, 52 years after Till’s death that he received his first memorial sign. It only lasted one year, before the sign was stolen and never returned, New York Times reports. Several signs have been replaced since the first one was stolen. Another was also shot, and the newest sign was replaced in June. No one has ever been caught for vandalizing the signs, but Mr. Weems says, “My sense is that it only takes one person to do this.” Mr. Weems says that there are talks of a new sign being being designed and made out of steel to be better than before.

adcd39d5,"ST. PETERSBURG Sputnik - The fact that the West has remained silent following the Russian Defense Ministry's recent release of new information about the downed flight MH17 proves the integrity of the data, Nicolas Dhuicq, a spokesman for the Debout La France France Arise party, told Sputnik on Tuesday. This article has been updated with the context information including reaction of the Dutch government, the Joint Investigation Team JIT and UK Defense Secretary. While investigators from the Joint Investigation Team JIT pledged to meticulously study the information presented by the Russian authorities as soon as it is made available to the JIT, the government officials' reactions were brief, with the Dutch government saying they had taken notice of the publications covering the Russian Defense Ministry briefing and UK Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson immediately rejecting Moscow's findings as another example of Russian disinformation. READ MORE: Russian Military Reveals Evidence Proving Ukraine's Involvement in MH17 Crash The Russian Defense Ministry on Monday presented declassified files on the Buk missile that hit flight MH17 in 2014, showing that the missile was made at Russia's Dolgoprudny Plant in 1986, delivered to a military unit in Ukraine, where it remained after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. We are unfortunately living in a propaganda era when media and the Western establishment are trying to discredit any information coming from Russia. The team that investigates the plane’s downing will be obliged to take into account this new information released by the Russian authorities but the international community will remain silent. They prefer not to speak on a topic where they were wrong. They are and will remain totally silent on a subject. Their silence proves that this information is true and credible, the official said. Dhuicq added that he, personally, had no reason to doubt the credibility of these new findings, pointing out that Russia would not have benefited from bringing down a civilian flight with 298 people on board, while Kiev in July 2014 was in despair and not fully in control of its military personnel. The organization of the Ukrainian army at that time was very hectic. There were groups that were not under the center’s [Kiev's] control. I also believe that there would be no benefit for Russia in bringing down a civilian airplane. I also always doubted that it was brought down by Donbas separatists because shooting such a missile requires some training and organization, he said. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed on July 17, 2014 in eastern Ukraine, while en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, leaving no survivors. Kiev and self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine’s southeast have blamed each other for the tragic incident.

We know that it was shamelessly wielded as a political weapon to prevent President Trump and his supporters from rallying as Antifa and Black Lives Matter burned progressive poor and minority neighborhoods to the ground throughout the entire year.  Now that Biden has been installed into the office of president, he promises to increase Covid lockdown measures and extend them further into your ability to travel and force unscientific mask-wearing for at least 100 days. But, a new peer reviewed study has been released that finds the CDC numbers to be so wildly unsupported as to be pure propaganda that is based on wholly unscientific practices that were needlessly created on-the-spot. CDC Twitter Profile Picture TRENDING: BREAKING -- LIVE STREAM VIDEO: Maricopa County, Arizona Audit Update -- ""TENS OF THOUSANDS, SHY OF 100,000 BALLOTS"" INSPECTED SO FAR! The National File Reports “THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) STANDS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW BY INFLATING CORONAVIRUS FATALITY NUMBERS, ACCORDING TO STUNNING INFORMATION OBTAINED BY NATIONAL FILE. CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson.” The study is 25 pages long with over 100 citations.  However, the main main points can be summarized. A major point is that testing inaccuracies and unreliability combined with unscientific procedures and methods resulted in demonstrably massive false-positive spikes: “The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. (READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine).” There are also profound legal implications raised by the study that need to be dealt with in courts around the country if America is to ever be free again.  The data you have been spoonfed by the CDC for a year raises serious legal issues.  Much like the 2020 election, massive changes in rules for reporting and collecting data were instituted exclusively for Covid which resulted in a 1600% inflated number of fatalities: “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study. “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.” But that is not all.  Other major Covid collection and reporting standards created on March 24th of 2020 that inexplicably and intentionally changed decades old practices in order to hide comorbidities and preexisting health conditions on death reports.  These underlying health conditions may likely have been the actual or most important cause of death: “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners, and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens. And, still, there is MORE!  Last spring the CDC created covid-19-exclusive rules that violated federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development and wrote new rules to count probable cases without any definitive proof of infection.  The new rules also allowed tracers to practice medicine without a license while disallowing any measures to be put in place to prevent a patient from being counted multiple times: “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection (section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5), new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license (section VII.A3 – page 5), and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case (section VII.B – page 7),” stated All Concerned Citizens. Why would those in power wish to do such inhumane things to the entire population of America? The National File concludes: “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.” There is much more to the report, and we suggest that you read it at the link provided in the beginning of this article. All data since last year suggest that Covid-19 hysteria is part of an orchestrated coup against Western values, nations, and laws. At what point will the evidence and data be enough to break the spell cast on millions of Americans by the Covid Cult? Please, bring this report to your local officials and insist that they read it and reverse the policies being implemented and ramped up across the country or America is surely dead.",FALSE
650bd80f,"When charges of “racism” and “xenophobia” fail, Democrats’ fallback argument against President Trump’s proposed border wall is that it simply “won’t work,” so why waste billions building it? Tell that to the residents of El Paso, Texas. Federal data show a far-less imposing wall than the one Trump envisions — a two-story corrugated metal fence first erected under the Bush administration — already has dramatically curtailed both illegal border crossings and crime in Texas’ sixth-largest city, which borders the high-crime Mexican city of Juarez. In fact, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the US Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the controversial new fence was built, according to Homeland Security data I reviewed. When the project first started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But they’re still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows. And crime abated with the reduced human traffic from Juarez, considered one of the most dangerous places in the world due to drug-cartel violence, helping El Paso become one of the safest large cities in America. Before 2010, federal data show the border city was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. El Paso since then has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. The turnaround even caught the attention of former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Obama administration officials, who touted it as one of the nation’s safest cities while citing the beefed-up border security there. Federal data illustrates just how remarkable the turnaround in crime has been since the fence was built. According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. The overall crime rate in El Paso continued to fall last year, prompting city leaders to trumpet the good news in a press release that noted, “Because El Paso is a border town, its low crime rate may surprise you.” Since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half El Paso City Manager Tommy Gonzalez boasted that the city will “continue to lead our country in public safety.” Another core promise made by Trump to justify constructing a massive wall spanning from Texas to California is that it will slow the flow of drugs coming across the border from Mexico. “We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety,” Trump said last week while answering questions about the sweeping new GOP immigration bill. “We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in.” On that score, El Paso already has exceeded expectations. Drug smuggling along that border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. All told, a legion of empirical evidence supports the idea a southern border wall could, in fact, work. There is also anecdotal evidence. In local press accounts, El Paso residents and business owners alike have praised the fence, citing it as an effective deterrent to both illegal crossings and crime. see also Border Patrol busts drop to 46-year low Arrests by Border Patrol agents dropped to a 46-year low... Now Trump plans to build a possibly bigger deterrent. The existing fence along the El Paso sector, which is made of a combination of corrugated steel and metal meshing, towers 21-feet high at some points and is already hard to climb. But the Trump wall, which will begin construction in El Paso, will be even taller and have multiple layers of security. Still, Democratic leaders are adamantly opposed to it. They argue the $18 billion wall won’t work to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and will only be a massive waste of tax dollars. “We think, frankly, the building of the wall, its cost is not justified either by its efficiency or effectiveness,” House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday. Even local Democrats are arguing with success. “That wall in itself is a racist reaction to a racist myth that does not reflect the reality of this country at all,” said Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-El Paso).

As a reminder, ""cycle thresholds"" (Ct) are the level at which widely used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can detect a sample of the COVID-19 virus. The higher the number of cycles, the lower the amount of viral load in the sample; the lower the cycles, the more prevalent the virus was in the original sample. Numerous epidemiological experts have argued that cycle thresholds are an important metric by which patients, the public, and policymakers can make more informed decisions about how infectious and/or sick an individual with a positive COVID-19 test might be. However, as JustTheNews reports, health departments across the country are failing to collect that data. In fact, as far back as October, we brought the world's attention to the COVID-19 ""casedemic"" and the disturbing reality of high-cycle threshold PCR tests being worse than useless as indicators of COVID-19 ""sickness"". PJMedia's Stacey Lennox said at the time: Biden will issue national standards, like the plexiglass barriers in restaurants he spoke about during the debate, and pressure governors to implement mask mandates using the federal government’s financial leverage. Some hack at the CDC or FDA will issue new guidance lowering the Ct the labs use, and cases will magically start to fall. In reality, the change will only eliminate false positives, but most Americans won’t know that. Good old Uncle Joe will be the hero, even though it is Deep-State actors in the health bureaucracies who won’t solve a problem with testing they have been aware of for months. TDS is a heck of a drug. And now, as Lennox explains in detail below, we have been proved 100% correct as less than one hour after President Biden's inauguration, the WHO proved us right. In August of last year, The New York Times published an article stating that as many as 90% of COVID-19 tests in three states were not indicative of active illness. In other words, they were picking up viral debris incapable of causing infection or being transmitted because the cycle threshold (Ct) of the PCR testing amplified the sample too many times. Labs in the United States were using a Ct of 37-40. Epidemiologists interviewed at the time said a Ct of around 30 was probably more appropriate. This means the CDC’s COVID-19 test standards for the PCR test would pick up an excessive number of false positives. The Times report noted the CDC’s own data suggested the PCR did not detect live virus over a Ct of 33. The reporter also noted that clinicians were not receiving the Ct value as part of the test results. Yet a PCR test instruction document from the CDC that had been revised five times as of July 13, 2020, specified testing and interpretation of the test using a Ct of 40. On September 28, 2020, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases from Jaafar et al. had asserted, based on patient labs and clinical data involving nearly 4,000 patients, that a Ct of 30 was appropriate for making public policy. An update to the CDC instructions for PCR testing from December 1, 2020, still uses a Ct of 40. Shortly before the New York Times article was published, the CDC revised its COVID-19 test recommendations, saying that only syptomatic patients should be tested. The media went insane, and Dr. Fauci went all over television saying he was not part of the decision to change the testing standards: “I am concerned about the interpretation of these recommendations and worried it will give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern. In fact it is.” So, of course, the Mendacious Midget™ had spoken, and the guidelines went back to testing everyone, all the time, with an oversensitive test.  The idea that asymptomatic spread was a concern as of August was just one of many lies Dr. Fauci told. At the beginning of the pandemic in late January, he said: The one thing historically that people need to realize is that even if there is some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks. The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person. Even if there is a rare asymptomatic person that might transmit, an epidemic is not driven by asymptomatic carriers. There is not a single study or meta-analysis that differs from Fauci’s original assessment. Today, within an hour of Joe Biden being inaugurated and signing an executive order mandating masks on all federal property, the WHO sent out a notice to lab professionals using the PCR test. It said: WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology. literally one hour after Biden takes the oath, the WHO admits that PCR testing at high amplification rates alters the predictive value of the tests and results in a huge number of false positives pic.twitter.com/iDtXmappRw — Andy Swan (@AndySwan) January 20, 2021 This translates to “in the absence of symptoms, a high Ct value means you are highly unlikely to become ill or get anyone else sick in the absence of very recent exposure to an infected person.” Dr. Fauci knew this in July when he said that tests with a Ct above 35 were likely picking up viral debris or dead virus. Even at a Ct of 35, the incidence of virus samples that could replicate is very low, according to Jaafar et al. The only state I know that requires reporting the Ct with every test is Florida, which started this policy in December. The WHO went on, stating: Most PCR assays are indicated as an aid for diagnosis, therefore, health care providers must consider any result in combination with timing of sampling, specimen type, assay specifics, clinical observations, patient history, confirmed status of any contacts, and epidemiological information. In short, a positive PCR test in the absence of symptoms means nothing at a Ct of higher than 30, according to the experts interviewed by the New York Times and according to Jaafar et al. Yet positive tests is the number CNN loves flashing on the screen. If the percentage found by the Times in August holds, there have been approximately 2.43 million actual cases to date, not 24.3 million. There is also no way to calculate the deaths from COVID-19 rather than deaths with some dead viral debris in the nostrils. What I have referred to as the “casedemic” since September will be magically solved just in time for Joe Biden to look like a hero. For doing absolutely nothing. Do not tell me there is not a politicized deep state in our health agencies. Do not ever tell me I need to listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci again. And every business owner who has been ruined because of lockdowns due to a high number of “cases” should be livid. Any parent whose child has lost a year of school should be furious. None of this was for your health. It was to get rid of Orange Man Bad. now they will drop the cycle rates and you can watch the curve go negative... like magic... because the new magic man isn't the bad man and the masks he ordered worked!!!!! — Andy Swan (@AndySwan) January 20, 2021 As an aside, this also clearly explains the disappearance of the ""flu"" during this season as the plethora of high Ct PCR Tests supposedly pointing to a surge in COVID are nothing of the sort.",partially false
c1343280,"✖ Just over a year from now, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is set to hit theaters, featuring the return of the eponymous character played by Benedict Cumberbatch and his wide array of supporting castmates. Prior to the film beginning principal photography in a matter of months, one dedicated fan artist has crafted the trippiest piece of Doctor Strange fan art we've seen. If we've got to be honest, we're not sure if anything else can get us as excited for the movie as this poster. Shared to Instagram by fan artist @sethtember, the poster takes the trippiness of what we've seen in Doctor Strange and takes it to a whole new level. Featuring the Time Stone and the Eye of Agamatto, the post includes Cumberbatch's Sorcerer Supreme in various forms. The background includes some Dark Dimension-esque effects that make it looks as if time and reality are folding in on itself. All in all, it's totally on-brand for the character. See it for yourself below. Despite being hit with some massive pre-production changes, reports suggest the film is still on track to meet its release date. It's been said the movie will be the first ""scary"" movie within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige previously compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark. “I mean, there are horrifying sequences in Raiders that I as a little kid would [cover my eyes] when their faces melted. Or Temple of Doom, of course, or Gremlins, or Poltergeist,” Feige said. “These are the movies that invented the PG-13 rating, by the way. They were PG and then they were like, ‘We need another [rating].’ But that’s fun. It’s fun to be scared in that way, and not a horrific, torturous way, but a way that is legitimately scary — because Scott Derrickson is quite good at that — but scary in the service of an exhilarating emotion.""

c83e9ca4,"FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Saturday, declared that in Nigeria today, over 14 million children that should be in school were not in school, and thereby deprived of education. Obasanjo made this known in Lagos at the virtual 2020 Fellowship Graduation Ceremony of the second cohort of “Teach for Nigeria Fellows”. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that “Teach For Nigeria”, an NGO, graduated 161 fellows who have impacted approximately 9,660 students in 80 schools across Lagos, Ogun, and the Kaduna States. NAN reports that “Teach For Nigeria” focuses on developing a movement of leaders across Nigeria who are committed to putting an end to educational inequity. Obasanjo said: “They are deprived of opportunities that will allow them to develop their abilities and become useful to themselves and their communities. “It is evident that at this point, to transform our education system in a sustainable way, Nigerian youths must take up leadership positions.” According to him, our youths must champion different innovative solutions at every level of the society and across different sectors. “It is inspiring to see the work that ‘Teach For Nigeria’ is doing to equip promising future leaders with the skills and experience to drive the change that we need,” the former president said. He added that the leaders had dedicated their time, energy and resources to inspire love for learning, improved educational outcomes, and enhanced life opportunities for children in the classrooms. “As a result of your commitment, your pupils have succeeded at various academic and non-academic competitions. “I recently learnt about pupils of ‘Teach For Nigeria Fellows’ who came second in the National Lafarge Competition and other scholarship opportunities. “They also initiated actions by working with stakeholders such as parents, community members, heads of schools and other teachers,” Obasanjo said. He, however, advised the fellows to continue to leverage their acquired skills and experiences to advocate for educational excellence in the country. The former president urged them to be ambassadors for change, driving the movement for freedom and justice in Nigeria. “I strongly advise that you remain resilient in your fight for educational equity, not relenting on the strides of deploying solutions to tackle the myriads of problems confronting our education system. “Please do not let anybody tell you that you are leaders of tomorrow, you are leaders today,” Obasanjo said. Also, Folawe Omikunle, the Chief Executive Officer, Teach For Nigeria, said that graduating fellows had spent the past two years improving the academic outcomes of their pupils. Omikunle said that they ignited the love for learning in these pupils, instilling self-belief, successfully galvanizing parental and community support to aid pupils learning process. “The graduating 161 fellows are joining our maiden set of 44 Alumni members, thereby bringing the number of our Alumni network to 205 members. “Teach For Nigeria is a lifelong commitment in the fight against educational inequity. “We are positive that our Alumni will continue to work toward ensuring that one day we have a Nigeria where every child can attain an excellent education,” she said.

cd9cd5e8,"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a test Wednesday of a new hypersonic glide vehicle, declaring that the weapon is impossible to intercept and will ensure Russia’s security for decades to come. Speaking to Russia’s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry’s control room, Putin said the successful test was a “great success” and an “excellent New Year’s gift to the nation.” The test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin's hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump's campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions. The Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent. From the left, Sergei Ivanov, Russian special representative on questions of ecology and transport, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chief of General Staff of Russia Valery Gerasimov, oversee the test launch of the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle from the Defense Ministry's control room in Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Dec. 26, 2018. Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP In Wednesday's test, the weapon was launched from the Dombarovskiy missile base in the southern Ural Mountains.

The Avangard is invulnerable to intercept by any existing and prospective missile defense means of the potential adversary, Putin said after the test, adding that the new weapon will enter service next year with the military's Strategic Missile Forces. When first presenting the Avangard in March, the Russian leader said the new system has an intercontinental range and can fly in the atmosphere at 20 times the speed of sound, bypassing the enemy's missile defense. He emphasized that no other country currently has hypersonic weapons. Putin has said that Avangard is designed using new composite materials to withstand temperatures of up to 2,000 degrees Celsius 3,632 degrees Fahrenheit that come from a flight through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.",Short breaks damage young people’s futures,other

72eb0d0c,"In response to Gen David Petraeus' denunciation of Florida pastor Terry Jones' right to engage in a symbolic protest of the 9/11 attacks by burning copies of the Quran this Sept. 11, President Obama said: ""Let me be clear: As a citizen, and as president, I believe that members of the Dove World Outreach Center have the same right to freedom of speech and religion as anyone else in this country."" Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida lauded Obama's remarks, saying America is ""a place where you're supposed to be able to practice your religion without the government telling you you can't."" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Obama's words a ""clarion defense of the freedom of religion"" -- and also claimed that he had recently run into a filthy jihadist who actually supported the Quran-burning! Keith Olbermann read the poem ""First they came ..."" on air in defense of the Quran-burners, nearly bringing himself to tears at his own profundity. No wait, my mistake. This is what liberals said about the ground zero mosque only five minutes ago when they were posing as First Amendment absolutists. Suddenly, they've developed amnesia when it comes to the free-speech right to burn a Quran. Weirdly, conservatives who opposed building the mosque at ground zero are also against the Quran burning. (Except in my case. It turns out I'm for it, but mostly because burning Qurans will contribute to global warming.) Liberals couldn't care less about the First Amendment. To the contrary, censoring speech and religion is the left's specialty! (Any religion other than Islam.) They promote speech codes, hate crimes, free speech zones (known as ""America"" off college campuses), and go around the country yanking every reference to God from the public square via endless lawsuits by the ACLU. Whenever you see a liberal choking up over our precious constitutional rights, you can be sure we're talking about the rights of Muslims at ground zero, ""God Hates Fags"" funeral protesters, strippers, The New York Times publishing classified documents, pornographers, child molesters, murderers, traitors, saboteurs, terrorists, flag-burners (but not Quran-burners!) or women living on National Endowment of the Arts grants by stuffing yams into their orifices on stage. Speaking of lying dwarfs, last week on ""The Daily Show"" Bloomberg claimed he was having a hamburger with his ""girlfriend"" when a man came up to him and said of the ground zero mosque: ""I just got back from two tours fighting overseas for America. This is what we were all fighting for. You go and keep at it."" We're fighting for the right of Muslims to build mosques at ground zero? I thought we were trying to keep Muslims AWAY from our skyscrapers. (What an embarrassing misunderstanding.) PLEASE PULL THE TROOPS OUT IMMEDIATELY. But back to the main issue: Was Bloomberg having a $150 Burger Double Truffle at DB Bistro Moderne or a more sensible $30 burger at the 21 Club when he bumped into his imaginary veteran? With the pint-sized mayor shrieking at the sight of a saltshaker, I assume he wasn't having a Hardee's No. 4 Combo Meal. Adding an element of realism to his little vignette, Bloomberg said: ""I got a hamburger and a pickle and a potato chip or something."" A potato chip? Translation: ""I don't know what I was eating, because I'm making this whole story up -- I wouldn't be caught dead eating 'a potato chip' or any other picaresque garnish favored by the peasants."" At least Bloomberg didn't claim the man who walked up to him took credit for setting the Times Square bomb because he was a tea partier upset about ObamaCare -- as Sherlock Bloomberg had so presciently speculated at the time. Gen. Petraeus objected to the Quran-burning protest on the grounds that it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans. This is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting? If the general's main objective is to hamper jihadist recruiting, may I respectfully suggest unconditional surrender? Because on his theory, you know what would really kill the terrorists' recruiting ability? If we adopted Sharia law! But wait -- weren't we assured by Fire Island's head of national security, Andrew Sullivan, that if America elected a ""brown-skinned man whose father was an African, who grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii, who attended a majority-Muslim school as a boy,"" the terrorists would look like a bunch of lunkheads and be unable to recruit? It didn't work out that way. There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the ""it will help them recruit"" argument yet? The reason not to burn Qurans is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm. The same goes for building a mosque at ground zero -- in both cases, it's not a question of anyone's ""rights,"" it's just a nasty thing to do.","Global Warming Is Driving Polar Bears Toward Extinction, Researchers Say",partially false

c850e415,"Words scaled by the frequency that President Trump has used them in tweets during his term in office, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump spent much of the 2020 presidential campaign insisting that he could only lose if the election was rigged against him, and he has spent nearly every day since his defeat claiming his dire predictions of fraud had come to pass. But just as he cried foul before a single vote was cast – something he also did in 2016 – Trump has maintained he was robbed of victory without any credible evidence to support that belief. Despite assurances from his own departments of Justice and Homeland Security that no serious fraud occurred, Trump has raged against the election result and mounted a relentless campaign to reverse President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win. More: Congress' count of Electoral College votes could be most contentious in 144 years. Here are past dramatic moments The president, his lawyers and his allies have filed scores of lawsuits; made repeated allegations of election fraud in news and social media; organized protests; tried to convince state legislatures to take action; and held hearings in various state houses, hotel ballrooms and, at one point, a landscaping company. And on Wednesday, 13 senators and more than 100 Republican lawmakers plan to object to the certification of Biden's win when Congress meets in a joint session. All those efforts to overturn the election can be a bit dizzying, so USA TODAY has broken it down by the numbers to help make sense of it all. Election lawsuits: 62 The president and his allies filed 62 lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking to overturn election results in states the president lost, according to Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who is tracking the outcomes. Election lawsuit defeats: 61 Out of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the presidential election, 61 have failed, according to Elias. Some cases were dismissed for lack of standing and others based on the merits of the voter fraud allegations. The decisions have came from both Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges – including federal judges appointed by Trump. More: 'It really is over now': The 24 hours that likely thwarted Trump's effort to overturn the election State Supreme Courts in Arizona, Nevada and Arizona each rejected or declined to hear Trump’s appeals to overturn results in those states, while the Pennsylvania and Michigan supreme courts denied multiple lawsuits. The 60th and 61st losses came in recent days. Last Friday, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas dismissed a lawsuit from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, that argued Vice President Mike Pence has the conditional power to decide which states' Electoral College votes to count. More: A look at what several state supreme courts said about rejecting attempts to overturn Biden's election win On Monday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona that argued state legislatures should have met after the election to certify votes. The lone victory for the Trump team was a small one. A Pennsylvania judge sided with the Trump campaign, ruling that voters could not go back and “cure” their ballots if they failed to provide proper identification three days after the election. The ruling affected few votes and did not change the outcome in Pennsylvania, which Biden won by 81,660 votes. Number of contested states: 6 The vast majority of the lawsuits were in six pivotal battleground states that Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump won five of the states four years ago in his victory over Hillary Clinton, but Biden flipped each to the Democratic column. House Republicans who plan to object to Electoral College results Wednesday said they plan to target these same six states. Number of times the US Supreme Court sided against Trump: 2 The U.S. Supreme Court twice refused to take up Trump-endorsed lawsuits that sought to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election. In a one-sentence denial, the Supreme Court on Dec. 8 rejected a request from Pennsylvania Republicans that sought to overturn Biden's win in the state. The challenge, led Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., claimed that the Republican-led state legislature's expansion of absentee voting violated the state's constitution. Three days later, the Supreme Court refused to let Texas challenge the election results in four battleground states critical to Trump's defeat. The court said Texas did not demonstrate ""a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections."" Number of recounts: 3 Georgia held two recounts of its presidential election results, both reaffirming Biden's win in the state. Wisconsin had one recount that confirmed Biden's victory there. The first recount in Georgia – a hand recount ordered by the state – found Biden won by 12,284 votes, a narrower margin than the 14,196-vote lead he held immediately following the election. Local election administrators identified uncounted ballots in four counties. Each was the result of human error. The second recount in Georgia – one requested by the Trump campaign – narrowed Biden's victory to 11,779 votes Votes Trump gained from recounts: 2,343 In Wisconsin, Biden gained 74 votes following a partial recount of the state's results that focused only on two Democratic strongholds, Milwaukee and Dane counties. It increased Biden's statewide margin to 20,682 votes out of about 3 million cast. Adding the differences in both states together, Trump gained 2,343 votes as a result of the Georgia and Wisconsin recounts. Number of elections Trump has claimed were rigged: At least 6 This is not the first time Trump has declared an election had been ""rigged"" or ""stolen."" On Election Day in 2012, when President Barack Obama defeated his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Trump tweeted that there were ""reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama."" ""Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen,"" he said. Four years later, when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defeated Trump in the Iowa caucuses, Trump tweeted, ""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 Trump also said the 2016 Democratic primary was ""rigged"" against Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and, as in 2020, he declared the 2016 general election race was ""rigged"" against him before it even took place. Even after winning the election and being sworn in as president, Trump baselessly insisted more than 3 million illegal votes were cast against him. A White House commission Trump created to investigate election fraud disbanded without finding any evidence to support the president's claims. Trump went on to allege ""fraud"" in the 2018 midterm elections and to imply there was something nefarious about the late changing vote totals in tight races, though such changes are routine in close elections where projections cannot be made immediately. Just out — in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018 The president also declared in 2020, without evidence, that the Democratic primary had once again been ""rigged"" against Sanders. Number of electoral votes changed as the result of Trump's effort: 0 Despite all the lawsuits, recounts and false voter fraud allegations, the Electoral College on Dec. 14 elected Biden the next president by a margin of 306 to 232 – marking no change in the electoral outcome. Biden finished with a record 81,281,502 votes nationally, defeating Trump in the popular vote by a sizable 7 million votes. With 51.3% of the national popular vote, Biden won with the highest share of the vote for a challenger of an incumbent president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Trump won 46.8% of the vote nationally. Days until Biden's inauguration Wednesday's joint session of Congress will have procedural fireworks as 13 U.S. senators and more than 100 Republican House members plan to object to electoral votes from potentially six battleground states that Biden won. But the efforts are doomed to fail, lacking the votes in the Democratic-controlled House and even in the Republican-led Senate. Because each objection could lead to hours of debate in the House and Senate, the session could be a marathon.

If there will be opening of schools, it must be stage and preferably carried out in phases to ensure that this does not pose a risk to the public and in particular to vulnerable groups that might end up getting infected by students going back home.” The federal government had ordered a nationwide closure of schools in March to check the spread of COVID-19.

7d255216,"SHARE By of the Madison — Gov. Scott Walker called a special legislative session Thursday to use a projected $100 million surplus to push down property taxes on the typical home by 0.4% more than expected this year. The two-year proposal would lower the December tax bill on the median-valued home by an additional $13 over current estimates, to $2,925. Next year, taxes under Walker's plan would rise modestly so that over two years they would be an estimated $11 more than they are now on the typical home. The total property taxes levied around the state on all property — from homes and businesses to farmland — would still increase because of other factors, such as new construction. Under Walker's proposal, total property taxes would rise by 1.2% this year and 1.8% next year. They would simply not increase as much as they are projected to go up under the two-year state budget the governor signed in June. At a Capitol news conference, Walker said he wanted to deliver the tax cut for December's property tax bills and to do that lawmakers needed to act quickly because local officials are in the process of finalizing their budgets and determining their tax levies. ""The more we looked at that, the more we looked at the size of the surplus, we said if we're going to do it, let's go big and go bold,"" Walker told reporters. ""Let's have dramatic impact on the people of the state when they're paying their property tax bill."" The move by the Republican governor would further stretch the state's small cash reserves over the next two years at a time when a partisan budget fight in Washington has eroded consumer confidence. The announcement came three days after Democrat and former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive Mary Burke announced she was challenging Walker in the 2014 race. The early remarks by both candidates have focused on improving the state's economy. ""I'm all in favor of lower taxes and supporting our schools, but I'd have to make sure that it really is doing just that, and it's doing it in a way that's fiscally responsible and balancing the budget,"" Burke said during a Green Bay news conference Thursday, according to video posted on the website of the Green Bay Press-Gazette. ""We're at record-high debt levels and our budget is at an all-time high as well, so we have to make sure we're being responsible and accountable for the funds that we're using."" Walker's proposal would increase state aid to local schools by $100 million over the next two years but not allow them to increase their total spending as limited by state-imposed caps. That would have the effect of forcing school officials to lower property taxes. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the typical state home is expected to see a $5 decrease in property taxes on December's bills to $2,938. Walker's proposal would come on top of that, dropping property taxes an additional $13. For bills that go out in December 2014, the typical homeowner would see a property tax bill of $2,974 under current law. Walker's plan would lower that number by $20. Projections by the nonpartisan fiscal bureau estimate that the state's main account will finish the current budget in June 2015 with $191 million in it. That number will change Tuesday when the state closes its books on the fiscal year ended in June — a process that in turn affects the state's starting balance for the current budget and all future projections. The $100 million in new school aid proposed by Walker would have to come out of the surplus being revised next week. In addition, the state's rainy day fund has about $280 million in it, which amounts to a small fraction of the overall state budget. Shortfall in next budget Walker's proposal would add to the shortfall of $545 million that is already being projected by the fiscal bureau for the next state budget starting in 2015-'17. Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the plan reminded him of a tactic used by former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle to lower property taxes ahead of his successful 2006 re-election bid. Berry said he was concerned that the hard-won surplus that the state is carrying into the current budget will be spent over the next two years despite the uncertainty hanging over the national economy. ""We're spending more in this year and next year than we're taking in, and that's a fact,"" Berry said. The plan will be formally introduced Friday and the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee will hold a hearing on it and approve it on Tuesday, said Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). The Assembly will likely take it up two days later, on Oct. 17, Vos said. The Senate could also take it up that day but might not do it until the following week,said Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), co-chairwoman of the finance committee. Two other bills will be included in Walker's special session — one to give a tax credit for historic preservation and one to grant towns tax incremental financing powers. The latter is aimed at helping development around a proposed Amazon distribution center in Kenosha, but Democrats raised concerns about how broadly the measure could be applied elsewhere. Too fast, Dems say Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Shorewood) said Walker's timetable for passing the proposal in as little as a week was too fast and that Democrats would need time to determine what the proposal means for schools, taxpayers and the state budget. Pasch said she wanted to consider whether the state's economy would benefit more from the tax cut or more from allowing the money to be spent by schools to make up for past cuts. Pasch said she also wanted to see how the additional spending by the state to cut local property taxes would affect the state's projected shortfall for the 2015-'17 budget. ""People love that, of course. Nobody wants to pay more in taxes,"" Pasch said of the proposed cut. ""The devil's in the details."" Pasch said that Walker didn't mention the proposal in a meeting with Democratic legislative leaders on Wednesday. She questioned the timing of the proposal following Burke's announcement Monday of her candidacy. ""It seems more politics than something that will have an impact for the average taxpayer,"" Pasch said. ""It gives me great pause."" Vos said the move would help improve the economy and allow taxpayers to benefit from the state's surplus. ""The reforms we made early in (Walker's) term with the Republican-led Legislature are really paying dividends for every single family across the state,"" Vos said. ""What we're doing today is sharing those dividends from the good decisions that have been made by the elected officials in Madison with the hard-working families all across Wisconsin.""

eea0ca8f,"Tesco has revealed that the amount of food waste generated by the supermarket giant increased to 59,400 tonnes last year – the equivalent of nearly 119 million meals. Tesco is the only major supermarket to publish its food waste data, and the increase came despite numerous initiatives designed to tackle the problem. The figure represents a 4% increase on 2015 with its beers, wines and spirits aisles and bakeries blamed for the rise. The amount wasted was the equivalent of one in every 100 food products sold by Tesco during the last financial year. The new figures, which were published at the time of its annual report, come as Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis today used a major industry conference to call for collective action to tackle food waste right across the supply chain – from farms to supermarket operations, right through to customers’ homes. “When I arrived at Tesco, we were the only UK retail company to publish our food waste data,” he said, “What the data shows is that it’s clear where we need to focus our efforts … nearly three years after we announced it, we are still the only UK retailer publishing our data.” He also called on companies, in the short term, to do more to redistribute their surplus edible food waste to people in need. Tesco has published its food waste figures since 2013, but no other retailer has followed suit. The retail giant says the transparent approach has helped it to identify hotspots and develop programmes to tackle the problem. While the problem got worse in its bakery departments last year, Tesco said it had managed to cut produce waste by 2%. The meals calculation uses a factor of 0.5kg for the average weight of a meal. Lewis, a former Unilever executive who was drafted in to lead a turnaround of Tesco in 2014, told the Global Summit of the Consumer Goods Forum: “Tackling food waste makes sense for business, it will help people and our planet, and it’s also the right thing to do.” To cut waste, Tesco has tried to reduce the time that food sits in its supply chain so that it can sell produce that lasts longer. It has also widened specifications to sell more of a crop with a range of “wonky” fruit and vegetables called “Perfectly Imperfect”, which launched in February. The retailer has also promised to redistribute all edible food waste from stores to charities by the end of 2017. A Tesco spokesman said: “We are confident that despite the small increase in our waste this year we have the right plans in place to see a reduction in future years and are proud of the work we have already done to redirect surplus food to provide millions of meals for those in need.” Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, told industry colleagues that tackling food waste makes sense for business. Photograph: Neil Hall/REUTERS This year the big four supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons signed a voluntary agreement that promised to drive down food and drink waste by a fifth within the next decade. Major brands and manufacturers, including Coca-Cola and Nestle also committed to the Courtauld Commitment 2025 which was produced by the Waste and Resources Action Programme Wrap. Wrap estimates that 1.9m tonnes of food is wasted in the UK grocery supply chain every year. “Wrap welcomes Tesco’s efforts to reduce its food waste,” said Dr Richard Swannell, director at Wrap. “Tesco, alongside all major UK retailers is signed up to Courtauld 2025. As part of Courtauld we report the retail sectors’ aggregate food waste levels and industry is making good progress. “Just recently we published new research that shows a 200,000 tonne reduction in food waste by retailers and manufacturers. Interest and action on tackling food waste has never been greater in the UK food sector, however WRAP research shows that waste in the 27-plus-million UK households remains the greatest challenge and opportunity. Through Courtauld 2025 we are seeking to increase the sectors’ efforts in tackling food waste with consumers, as well as at an operational level.”",Ohio to compile private registry to track convicted arsonists,TRUE
431f2c82,"Hundreds of Nigerian women die every day of complications arising from unsafe abortions, an international NGO, Ipas has said. Country Director of Ipas (Nigeria), Mr Lucky Palmer, said this on Sunday at a three-day “Media Training for Journalists on Women’s Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights/Global Gag Rule’’, in Keffi, Nasarawa State. Palmer also disclosed that every eight minutes, a woman in a developing country died from such complications, adding that the figures were drawn from only those who visited hospitals for medical attention. According to the Ipas representative in Nigeria, of the 85 million women who get pregnant annually, 40 million of them usually end up having abortions, with developing countries accounting for 98 per cent of the unsafe abortions. He also said Africa and Latin America accounted for the highest number of unsafe abortions globally. Palmer expressed sadness that Nigeria was yet to reform restrictive domestic laws and policies that placed women and girls’ health and lives at risk; as well as preventing them from exercising rights that the government had committed to under the international law. The IPAs country representative added that in 2012 alone, 1.25 million Nigerian women had an abortion, doubling the number estimated in 1996. He emphasised that unless urgent steps were taken, the number would keep increasing because only 16 per cent of all women of reproductive age were using any contraceptives, and just 11 per cent using modern methods. “That results in almost 10 million unintended pregnancies, of which more than half end in an induced abortion,’’ he said. The country director attributed this worrying global health challenge to the Global Gag Rule, noting that the training of journalists to help with awareness and advocacy, was one of the ways the organisation was exploring to tackle the issue. He said a big burden was on the media to work closely with relevant organisations in curbing the menace. Palmer urged the media to liaise with relevant agencies in advocating for the enforcement of laws and domestication of Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, to promote women’s sexual rights and health, create awareness, as well as educate the public on consequences of unsafe abortions.

57a7f2c6,"MOSCOW, December 21. /TASS/. The US administration has invested too much money into the coup in Ukraine and now has to babysit Ukrainian leader Pyotr Poroshenko despite his weak electoral positions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday night. Regretfully, Washington is forced to babysit Poroshenko, even despite his relatively weak electoral positions, the Kremlin official said. Too much money was invested into Ukraine, too much money was poured into the coup in Ukraine, and justifying this coup also requires too much money. Peskov suggested that the United States expect its investment to somehow pay for itself, to yield some dividends. Apparently, they [the United States] did not quite succeed and now need to do their best to save the situation, he said. According to Peskov, the Russian-Ukrainian relations were further strained by the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine. At the moment, President Poroshenko has to win electoral support by all means, because the approval of him is low compared to the rivals who have overtaken him in the electoral rating. And this is exactly what he is doing, and this is clearly visible to us all, the Kremlin spokesman said. The most dangerous thing in this situation is that President Poroshenko himself would seek to further escalate the situation and use it for electoral gain, he said, adding that Washington will have no other choice, but to support Poroshenko. Washington has to support Poroshenko and turn a blind eye to the real situation, which is exactly what it is doing now, he said. We have no doubt that this approach would continue. Speaking about the development of Russian-US relations, the Kremlin spokesman described them as a victim of the provocation made by the Ukrainian side near Kerch. However, when asked whether the Ukrainian leader’s actions may trigger international pressure on Russia that would force Moscow to act to the detriment of its own national interests, Peskov replied: The answer is categorical: no. And President Putin has said that many times..",IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS FORT WORTH DIVISION FEDERAL DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION,FALSE

The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbestos. Fresh red meat is also due to join the ‘encyclopaedia of carcinogens’ and is likely to be ranked as only slightly less dangerous than the preserved products. Scroll down for video The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbestos The rulings, revealed to the Mail by a well-placed source, will send shock waves through the farming industry and the fast food sector. They could also lead to new dietary guidelines and warning labels on packs of bacon. The classifications, by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, come amid mounting concern that meat fuels the disease which claims more than 150,000 lives a year in the UK. Links to bowel cancer, Britain’s second biggest cancer killer, are particularly strong, with estimations that half of cases could be prevented by healthier lifestyles. The Department of Health’s scientific advisers recently concluded that red and processed meat ‘probably’ increase the odds of bowel cancer. But the WHO is expected to go further by saying processed meat causes cancer. The decision, due on Monday, follows a meeting of scientists from ten nations, including the UK, who reviewed all available evidence. Smoking: Scientists are believed to have agreed processed meat is ‘carcinogenic to humans’, the highest of five possible rankings, shared with alcohol, asbestos, arsenic and cigarettes They are believed to have agreed processed meat is ‘carcinogenic to humans’, the highest of five possible rankings, shared with alcohol, asbestos, arsenic and cigarettes. Risks and benefits must be considered together before telling people what to eat, drink, drive, breathe, or where to work Barry Carpenter, president of the North American Meat Institute Processed meat is made by smoking, curing, salting, or adding chemicals. Examples are ham, bacon, pastrami and salami, as well as hot dogs and some sausages. Burgers are also expected to be included. Red meat is expected to be one rung below, ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’. Meat in general contains high concentrations of fat and it is thought the compound that gives meat its red colour may damage the bowel lining. Processed meat has previously been blamed for one in 30 deaths and is seen as dangerous because preserving techniques can raise levels of cancer-causing chemicals. It is estimated that if intake was cut to 20g a day – a rasher of bacon a day or an English breakfast once a week – almost 20,000 early deaths would be prevented in the UK each year. Ruling: The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbesto Any advice to cut, or avoid, processed meat will be welcomed by cancer charities. But it could have huge repercussions for the meat industry, which will be mindful that sugar sales fell last year after the WHO issued a warning on overconsumption. The beef sector makes £2.8billion for the economy and provides 440,000 jobs in England. The North American Meat Institute NAMI said the report defied 'both common sense and dozens of studies showing no correlation between meat and cancer'. 'Red and processed meat are among 940 substances reviewed by International Agency for Research IARC on found to pose some level of theoretical 'hazard,' said Barry Carpenter, president of NAMI. 'IARC says you can enjoy your yoga class, but don’t breathe air Class I carcinogen, sit near a sun-filled window Class I, drink wine or coffee Class I and Class 2A,, eat grilled food Class 2A, or apply aloe vera Class 2B. 'Risks and benefits must be considered together before telling people what to eat, drink, drive, breathe, or where to work.' The industry says red meat is rich in protein, a good source of vitamins, iron and zinc, and a key part of a balanced diet. Professor Richard Knox, a former Institute of Cancer Research expert, said ‘most cancer deaths will not be due to bowel cancer and even fewer linked to meat consumption’. Government guidelines on red meat, given in 2011, recommend adults eat no more than 70g a day.","Trump aims new blasts at McCain, claims credit for funeral",FALSE
99fc8e17,"by Sen. Doug Whitsett More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly. Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms. A few of the more aggressive bills included: • House Bill 3200 that would have created the crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. • House Bill 3413 that would have created the crime of endangering a minor, by allowing the minor access to a fire arm, punishable by up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. • SB 347 that would have allowed each school district to establish their own rules regarding the right to carry a licensed concealed weapon on school property. Violation of the law would have constituted criminal trespass, resulting in penalties of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. This bill would also have preempted the current law that only allows the legislative body to create laws regulating firearms. • SB 699 that would have restricted the right to carry a concealed weapon in the capitol building by most licensed people without the written permission of the legislative administration. • SB 700 that would have required completion of a background check, before any firearm could be transferred between private parties. Failure to complete the background check could have resulted in penalties up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $125,000, or both. • SB 758 that would have required the owner of a firearm to carry specific liability insurance on each firearm in their possession. It also made it a crime to transfer a firearm to another person unless that individual carried liability insurance on the weapon. Failure to maintain liability insurance on each firearm would have resulted in fines of up to $10,000 per firearm. • SB 796 that would have required completion of a concealed handgun course, including a live fire test, before a concealed handgun license could be issued. It is unclear why our legislature should focus its attention on increasing the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. It seems that no one can remember the last time that an Oregon handgun licensee committed a crime with a firearm. Each of these bills, except HB 3413, had an emergency clause attached. The only reason for the emergency clause would have been to prevent the bill from being referred to the people to decide. None of these bills were enacted into Oregon law. The primary reason that the bills did not pass was because the Senate Leadership knew that the combined 15 no votes of 14 Senate Republicans, and of Senator Betsy Johnson, would have defeated each of the bills on the Senate floor. For that reason, they were never allowed to come to the Senate floor for a vote. From my perspective, that vote count is much too close for comfort. Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights. Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent. Unintended deaths by firearms have dropped by nearly 60 percent since 1993, and have decreased by more than 80 percent since 1929. This dramatic decline in the number of crimes committed with firearms has occurred during the same time period when our national population has increased from 250 million to 315 million people. During the same twenty years, more than 100 million guns have been sold to private citizens in the United States. Forty three percent of U.S homes now report that they possess one or more firearms. I would imagine that the gun owning percentage is actually much higher than reported, because many people who own firearms do not prefer to let anyone know that they have those weapons. All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns. Nonetheless, gun violence is the third most often reported event by our news media. That rate of reporting is only surpassed by news reports on traffic and the weather. The media almost never reports the daily events where violence is prevented by an armed citizen. It is this constant media bias that is primarily responsible for people believing that gun violence is on the increase. In my opinion, our most important right, as citizens of the United States, is our constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment right to own and bear firearms. Throughout recorded history, each and every would-be dictator and despot has first convinced the people to disarm, allegedly in order to make their society a safer and more peaceful place to live. Once they have given up their firearms they have been systematically stripped of all other human rights. We must not allow glib-speaking politicians, and a complicit news media, to convince us that we are safer without firearms. We are not safer. We are defenseless.

A new bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology says that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control WHCDC could have spawned the contagion in Hubei province. 'The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,' penned by scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats. It also mentions that bats - which are linked to coronavirus - once attacked a researcher and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' Workers in protective gear carry a bag containing a giant salamander that was reported to have escaped from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province in January The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis intermediate horseshoe bat.' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out withing a few hundred yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. 'It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.' And as well as the WHCDC, the report suggests that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could also have leaked the virus, as has previously been reported by MailOnline. 'This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV which caused the 2002-3 pandemic,' the report says. members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei on January 11 The seafood market after it was locked off by police at the beginning of January 'The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence 10.

While it had been previously thought the problem had affected one in 10 women, new research revealed that 27% of females have at times been unable to afford sanitary products. More than half of the UK population 51% have suffered from the problem, or know someone who has, the research indicated, with more than two-thirds of women 68% having been forced to use makeshift menstrual protection at some point. The survey, carried out for a project set up to combat period poverty, also found such problems had caused 26% of girls and women to miss either school or work. A total of 931 people across England, Scotland and Wales were questioned for the research, which was carried out by Ginger Comms together with campaigners at the Bloody Big Brunch. It organises brunch events across the country, where participants pay not with money but by donating sanitary products in a bid to put the issue of period poverty firmly on the table by not only reducing embarrassment around periods, but also by making it easy to send menstrual products to where they are needed most. Its largest ever campaign day is due to take place on Sunday March 3, with singer and TV presenter Stacey Solomon among those who will be hosting a brunch event. She said: “I am so excited that the Bloody Big Brunch has gone national. It’s a hugely important issue and this is an easy way for people to get involved.

Meanwhile, the Welsh Government has announced £1 million of funding to tackle period poverty, resulting in campaigners claiming England is being “left behind”. Amika George, who started the Free Periods campaign, said they are taking legal action against the UK Government. “The Scottish and Welsh governments have made history with their pledges of period provision for girls in schools, colleges and universities, but in England we’re being left behind. “That’s why we are taking legal action against the government, to ensure every schoolchild gets access to the essential products that they need. “Equal access to education is a fundamental human right and no-one should miss school because they cannot afford pads and tampons.

Whilst our current analysis shows there is no evidence that period poverty has a significant nationwide impact on school attendance, we are continuing to look into this sensitive issue and schools can make sanitary products available if they identify access to products as a barrier to girls attending school.” Lucy Russell, of children’s charity Plan International UK, said: “It’s simply unacceptable that in 21st-century Britain, women and girls are suffering because they don’t have enough money to manage their period. “We know from our own research that two-fifths of girls have been forced to rely on toilet roll at some point because they’ve struggled to afford menstrual products. “We fully support the call for free and accessible menstrual products where women and girls are struggling with the cost of managing their period, but this will only solve part of a very complex problem.”",The Revolution Begins at Home: An Open Letter to Join the Wall Street Occupation,FALSE

Early intervention funding - previously called the early intervention grant - enables local authorities to step in and help a child or young person who is vulnerable or at risk. The help includes advice on teenage pregnancy or drugs and alcohol, and help from children's centres and early years services. In a report - Cuts that cost: Trends in funding for early intervention services - research suggests that government funding for a range of early help services in England fell from £3.2bn in 2010 to £1.4bn in 2015. The charities say there are early indications, from a Freedom of Information request by the publication Children & Young People Now, that reductions in spending are set to continue for children's centres and services in 2015-16. A fund set up for the most vulnerable families in society, the Troubled Families programme, is expected to increase or remain stable. Preventing crises Experts in social work and child protection have suggested a potential link between the rise of child protection cases and the reduction in spending on early intervention services. Levels of demand on the child protection and care systems can provide some indication of the effectiveness of services that work to support families struggling to care for their children and prevent them reaching crisis point, says the report. Small child left aloneimage copyrightThinkstock image captionEarly intervention can turn around a child's life, says the report Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: Early intervention and help for children of all ages improves their lives, stops damage, and prevents more costly remedial solutions in the subsequent few years. That's why we are calling on government to prioritise funding for early intervention and help for teenagers and children to make sure councils can maintain these essential services as we enter another period of austerity. If we keep cutting early help now it will cost us all dearly in the long run. A government spokesman said: Ensuring every child, regardless of their background, is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential is at the heart of this government's drive to provide real social justice. We have invested more than £2bn in early intervention services, including 15 hours of free childcare for the most disadvantaged two-year-olds and enough funding to retain a national network of children's centres, which are helping a record number of parents. We have given councils the freedom to use their funds on those services most needed by their communities. The £448m Troubled Families programme has turned around the lives of 117,000 of the most complex families, working with up to 400,000 more families from this year, backed with a further £200m investment.","Chris King Statement on 800 Percent Increase in Health Insurance Premiums for Low-Income Seniors Under Trumpcare  Orlando, Florida",other
c3a1bd4e,"I hate science, evidently, because I’m woke to the manifest truth about what the leftist elite currently calls “climate change."" It is the second most staggering fraud ever perpetrated upon the American people after the media’s promotion of the unstoppable candidacy of Beto (who is a furry). Like some suckers still do, I once believed that “science” was a rigorous process where you tested theories and revised those theories in response to objective evidence. But in today’s shabby practice, “science” is just a package of self-serving lies buttressing the transnational liberal elite’s preferred narrative. Our alleged betters hope that labeling their propaganda “science” will science-shame you into silence about what everyone knows is a scam. Nah. “Climate change” is a hoax. Come arrest me for felony denial. Understand that the term “climate change” does not refer to actual meteorological phenomena but, rather, to the sordid rat-king of lies, scams and power grabs that we are commanded to accept as pagan gospel lest we burn to a crisp or drown or suffer...whatever the Armageddon du jour is. When you say “climate change is a grift,” and you should as often as possible, you are pointing out that this green-on-the-outside/red-on-the-inside fake frenzy is really just a set of intertwined grifts transparently designed to separate you from your freedom and your property in the name of somehow adjusting the weather. Observing that “climate change” is steaming garbage served in a dirty ashtray is not disputing that the climate changes. That the climate is not static, and never could be static, is one of the myriad reasons that this whole idea is ridiculous. The planet gets hotter, it gets colder, sometimes quickly, sometimes over eons, and there are a bunch of reasons why, like the sun and volcanos. Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors, but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one. Of course, if they really cared about carbon, they would be up in arms about China and India, which are upping their output while we are slashing ours. Yet the object of their ire is your New York strip. Gosh, does that seem consistent with 1) someone truly concerned about atmospheric carbon, or 2) someone who trembles with joy at the notion of bossing around you rubes out in gun/Jesusland? The underlying premise of their claims seems to be that there is a “right” temperature for the earth; watch them sputter when you enquire about that perfect setting for Earth’s thermostat. Remember, if you ask questions you hate “science.” If they did stop telling you how you hate “science” long enough to respond, they might explain that of course there’s no perfect temperature – it’s not like LA, where it’s always 72 degrees. But then, what are they comparing the present climate to in order to declare that our climate is “getting worse?” If you establish a climate baseline, then you can compare what’s actually happening to the baseline and that might demonstrate that the whole thing is baloney. That would be awkward. It happened after Katrina. Oh, Katrina’s proof positive that Gaia is really ticked off and…and…and…then we had a bunch of years without much hurricane action at all. You might think that this would be evidence that maybe the climate wasn’t in chaos, and that they would be happy to be proven wrong, but no, it doesn’t work that way. Every time the weather fits the narrative, you see, it’s proof that the climate kooks are right, and every time the weather fails to fit the narrative, well, weather’s not climate. At least until the next heat wave or storm; then weather will totally be climate again. Heads, you must give us all your freedom and money, and also tails, you must give us all your freedom and money. Now, we’re being told that we’re all going to die in…I guess we’re down to what? About 11.5 years this go ‘round? Of course, we’ve been told many times that we’re doomed and the deadlines have come and gone with the doomsdayers not missing a beat. They’re like old timey Elmer Gantrys promising the apocalypse over and over again, with their hardcore true believers regularly showing up for the rapture over and over again no matter how many times the Four Horseman fail to turn up. We haven’t even seen one horseman. Back in the 70s, I remember we were promised an ice age if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. Then in the 80s, we were promised death by ozone hole if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, and then doom by acid rain if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. By the time they started promising that we were all gonna die from global warming if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, I was still wanting my ice age. It would be nice to have a white Christmas in LA. So, where’s my damn ice age? Oh right, only a climate denier – Climate, I deny thee! – might wonder why we should hand over one, ten, a hundred trillion bucks to people who have never once been right about their predictions. You evidently hate “science” if you expect the “science” people to be correct at least one time in a half-century. And they’re not even good at short-term prognostication. Heck, for several days Hurricane Dorian was supposed to slam head on into Florida and then…it didn’t. The Obamas just bought a $15 million pad on the beach – what’s that say about their faith in “science?” But don’t worry, the guys batting .000 so far will definitely get the temperature in 2119 right if we only just write them a huge check and transform ourselves from citizens to serfs. That’s another big red flag – have you noticed how “science” always tells us that the only possible response to the climate hullabaloo is to give liberals exactly what they always wanted anyway? How lucky are the leftists to have had an existential problem drop in their laps where the only solution is to give them everything they could not otherwise convince us to give them? What a remarkable coincidence! And what’s also weird is how nothing that we must do right now no time to debate it’s a crisis think o’ the children in any way inconveniences or calls for sacrifices from our climate crisis-pushing elite. Boy, they really scored with climate change – if they were going to manufacture a crisis in order to get the power and money they craved, how would they do it any differently? Now, they might claim that they too will have to sacrifice to the Angry Weather Demon, but it’s unclear how. I suppose they might stop flying across the globe to climate finger-wagging festivals in private jets, but call me jaded for thinking that if it’s such a crisis today and they have not stopped doing it yet, they won’t stop jetting about down the road. Oh, but you will. You most definitely will stop flying and driving the vehicles you choose and eating cheeseburgers and using straws that don’t disintegrate into gummy sludge in your Dr. Pepper. But them? Pete Buttigieg explained away his zipping around in Gulfstreams as necessary because it is important for him to be pestering people in Des Moines. Bet you that pretty much everything our betters want to do will turn out to be “important.” And I’ll bet that nothing what you peasants want to do will. One might think that if stopping carbon was important, you might want to explore nuclear power. But you would think wrong. After all, if there’s plenty of electrical power, the elite loses the political power that comes from divvying up a scarce resource. If they control the power, they control you. Cheap, plentiful power makes you freer, which is a bug, not a feature. Oh, and those many millions of people in Middle America who directly or indirectly rely on fracking and the rest of the fossil fuel industry? Even bloody-eyed, Gaffe-atronic Joe 3000 wants to shaft you. Better learn to code or something, because your good job is history. Weird how all the sacrifice once again falls on those out in the hinterlands and not on the blue coastal city swells, huh? But you’ll be able to rest easy knowing that our moral superiors in Brooklyn and Alexandria and Santa Monica enjoyed showing you sweaty rubes who’s really the boss by impoverishing you. Because that, and not the weather in a century, is and always has been what the “climate change” hoax is really all about.

People you despise for being cruise-shilling grifter dweebs called these tomes “appalling.” Can there be a greater endorsement?","The Liberal Democrats have devoted a great deal of time at their party conference to attacking my predecessor as Witney MP, David Cameron, over his decision to call the EU referendum. These attacks are an attempt to sanitise their own role in campaigning for – and to airbrush their contribution to securing – that very referendum.

Let’s get some of the basics clear first. The Conservative manifesto promise to hold an in/out referendum was endorsed by the British people in 2015, being crucial to the party’s majority at that year’s general election. The very fact that the British public voted to Leave a year later demonstrates how wide and deep was discontent in Britain at the country’s EU membership, at least without fundamental reform. Ever since the advent of the euro, and the further integration required to sustain it, Britain and the EU were on different paths requiring at the very least a fundamentally reformed relationship. Cameron is correct that a referendum was, at some point, probably inevitable in any event.

We should not forget: the referendum was not called by Cameron alone. Even as Prime Minister, he did not have the authority to simply call the referendum. That required an Act of Parliament, which passed by an overwhelming majority with 544 MPs in favour and just 53 against at Second Reading. As it happened, seven of the Lib Dems’ then eight MPs voted for the EU Referendum Bill in 2015.

But the Lib Dems’ hypocrisy does not end there. For all the vitriol they pour on Cameron for holding the referendum, the Lib Dems neglect to mention that they were calling for an in/out referendum on the EU many years before the Conservative Party. Indeed, we have all seen the infamous 2008 Lib Dem campaign leaflet circulating on Twitter – very familiar to those of us who were Conservative activists at the time – featuring a fresh-faced Nick Clegg demanding “a real referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.” The leaflet observed that:

“It’s been over thirty years since the British people last had a vote on Britain’s membership of the European Union. That’s why the Liberal Democrats want a real referendum on Europe. Only a real referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU will let the people decide our country’s future.”

2008 was also the year that Clegg infamously stormed out of the House of Commons when the then speaker, Michael Martin, refused to call a Lib Dem amendment in his name demanding an in/out EU referendum.

Following Ed Davey’s expulsion from the chamber, Clegg said:

“I share the dismay of [Ed Davey]. What guidance can [the Deputy Speaker] give me on how we can secure – if not today, at some point during the remaining stages of the Bill – the opportunity to debate the issue that many members want debated and many members of the public want debated: our future membership of the EU?”

Davey (then the Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesman) had struck an even more forceful tone, remarking:

“Will the Chair reconsider the decision not to select the Liberal Democrat amendment for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU? That is the question that goes to the heart of the debate before the House. That is the debate that people want to hear. We are being gagged, Sir.”

The current Lib Dem Leader, Jo Swinson, also contributed to this debate, and her speech is fascinating when compared with the comments she made at the weekend. Swinson repeated that:

“The Liberal Democrats would like to have a referendum on the major issue of whether we are in or out of Europe.”

On an in/out EU referendum, she noted:

“We support such a referendum; we will continue to campaign for it and hope that it will find favour in this House.”

Furthermore, she described being denied a vote on Clegg’s referendum amendment as “incredibly disappointing” and something she felt “very passionately” about.

Swinson’s eurosceptic side – mysteriously neglected of late – was also on display, as she noted:

“For too long, power in the EU has been concentrated among those who are appointed, not elected. The structures of the EU have often proved cumbersome to say the least, at times even making this House look modern and streamlined by comparison.”

The Lib Dems remained proponents of an in/out referendum at the 2010 General Election which saw them enter into a Coalition Government with the Conservatives, with a carefully caveated manifesto promise to hold a referendum “the next time a British government signs up for fundamental change in the relationship between the UK and the EU”.

The fact that the Lib Dems long advocated giving the British people a say on our membership of the EU, and indeed were the first mainstream party to call for an in/out referendum on the matter, makes their new pledge to cancel Brexit without even a second referendum all the more extraordinary. And that, itself, being an evolution from a position that a second referendum result would only be respected if it resulted in a Remain vote.

Seemingly without a hint of self-awareness, Lib Dem party policy is now to ignore the result of a referendum for which they themselves were the first to call. This wildly divisive policy shows the Lib Dems to be utterly disinterested in bringing the country together, their uncompromising approach only serving to fuel further discord and division. There is nothing inherently wrong with regretting a referendum result, but it is deluded to think that pretending it didn’t happen is going to lead to anything other than bitter polarisation.

It is therefore no surprise that Lib Dem grandee Sir Norman Lamb has warned that the party is “playing with fire”, describing the new policy as “a threat to the social contract” that risks dividing an already fractured country further.

Let’s be clear: nullifying a referendum for which the Lib Dems were the first to call, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by Parliament and which was the largest democratic exercise in our nation’s history, is not a moderate position. Neither liberal, nor democrats, this party has become the truly extremist force in British politics.",FALSE
500e8ec9,"At the Conservative party conference two weeks ago, I spoke about a young black woman who had to put a more white-sounding name on her CV before she started getting called for interviews. Such racism in 21st-century Britain, I said, was a disgrace, and I committed our party to ending discrimination and finishing the fight for real equality. The audience rose to their feet. It was a significant moment. And it provoked three reactions. The first was: “What on earth are the Tories doing speaking about equality? It’s not their issue.” To this I say “nonsense”. We’re not just the party of the first Jewish prime minister and the first female prime minister; we’re the party that introduced the Disability Discrimination Act, legalised gay marriage and reduced stop-and-search, and that today will start forcing companies to publish the gap between men and women’s pay, and making police record Islamophobia as a separate hate crime. I accept that we haven’t always got this 100% right. No party ever has. And, because of our belief in equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome, for too long we have thought the only barrier to success was a lack of a decent education. Of course, that’s the most important thing – and it’s why school reform has been at the heart of our plan in government. But we need to sweep away the other things holding people back, not least discrimination. You can give someone all the opportunities in the world – a brilliant school, first-class training, decent jobs – but it’s no good if they’re prevented from getting on because of their gender, race, religion, sexuality or disability. Getting this right is a natural and logical next step for a modern, compassionate Conservative party that wants to extend social mobility. The second reaction was: “All right then, the Tories get this, but the only thing you can do is pass laws, and where are your proposals?” Of course, laws are important, like ours on disability discrimination and equal marriage. And we should recognise that the Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1976, or the Equal Pay Act from 1970 didn’t just outlaw discrimination, they also helped to change attitudes and shift public opinion. But for all the legislation we have passed, discrimination still persists. It’s no longer signs on doors that say “no blacks allowed”; it’s quieter and more subtle discrimination. It’s the disappointment of not getting your first choice of university place; it’s being passed over for promotion and not knowing why; it’s organisations that recruit in their own image and aren’t confident enough to do something different, like employing a disabled person or a young black man or woman. In my opinion, you won’t change these attitudes simply through more laws, but in smarter, more innovative ways. The third reaction was: “Right, if you mean this, when and how will you show us how?” We have managed to get some of the biggest graduate employers to pledge to anonymise their job applications – in other words, make them name-blind. That means those assessing applications will not be able to see the person’s name, so the ethnic or religious background it might imply cannot influence their prospects. The civil service, BBC, NHS, local government, HSBC, Deloitte, KPMG, Virgin Money, learndirect – all these and more will now recruit people solely on merit. The Conservative party HQ will do it too. Taken together, these organisations employ 1.8 million people. And we’ll go further. Some research has shown that top universities make offers to 55% of white applicants, but only to 23% of black ones. The reasons are complex, but unconscious bias is clearly a risk. So we have agreed with UCAS that it will make its applications name-blind, too, from 2017. Britain has come so far, but the long march to an equal society isn’t over. Today’s announcement is not the only thing we can do, but it’s a milestone. And it means that a young black woman knows she’ll get a fair shot when she applies for the job of her dreams.","New study shows sea level rise has been slow and a constant, pre-dating industrialization",partially false
beea9b95,"By Truth In Sentencing Project, Press Release LISTEN to the Radio Ad here Lake Oswego, Or (July 19, 2012) – The Truth in Sentencing Project, a foundation dedicated to educating and informing Oregon’s citizens about the state’s criminal justice, prison systems and sentencing laws is releasing its first ad today. The ad is intended to let Oregonians know who is in prison and why they are there. • It addresses Oregon’s low incarceration rate, 33rd out of 50 states. Nearly 2/3rds of states have higher incarceration rates. The ad also calls into question Oregon’s high cost per day to incarcerate compared to other states such as Idaho. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about Oregon’s sentencing laws and the criminal justice and prison systems and the Truth in Sentencing Project’s goal is to dispel those misconceptions,” said Steve Doell, Executive Director. For instance, many people believe that up to fifty percent of the prison population is incarcerated for possessing drugs. • In some states that may be true, however in Oregon less than one-half of one percent of Oregon’s 14,000 inmates is serving time for drug possession, and those were convicted for possession of substantial quantities of illegal drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine, according to the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC). Also according to the CJC: • Less than 1 in 4 of all convicted felons receive prison sentences in Oregon. • About 7 in 10 of Oregon’s inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses including felony assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, manslaughter, child molestation, rape, attempted murder, and murder. • Seventeen percent are repeat property criminals, burglary, identity theft, fraud and car theft. Most of the rest are repeat drug criminals, almost all convicted of manufacturing and/or dealing substantial quantities of illegal drugs. One of the main reasons for the high percentage of violent criminals in Oregon prisons is because the voters passed Measure 11 in 1994. “The voters were tired of the high violent crime rate in Oregon and violent criminals receiving short sentences so they put a high priority on violent crimes,” Doell stated. “And while Oregon’s violent crime rate increased nearly 700% from 1960 until 1985, then basically plateaued through 1995, the violent crime rate has decreased more than 50% since then. We believe one of the most significant reasons for this decrease is Measure 11,” Doell added.",Theresa May admits Government’s social security experts were not consulted about disability benefits cuts,TRUE
255cc8ca,"HOUSTON, TX— Rep. Robert “Beto” O’Rourke (D-Texas) continued today his reckless and radical Senate campaign based on impeaching Pres. Donald Trump. He is the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for impeachment. The most recent incident was at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. In response to a question by the Dallas Morning News, O’Rourke said: “…if I were asked to vote on this, I would vote to impeach the president.” O’Rourke explained that, “Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.” O’Rourke has been consistent throughout his campaign for U.S. Senate that he would vote to impeach Pres. Trump, such as on KFYO radio on April 10, on Showtime’s “The Circus” in May — and as far back as an interview with Reuters in November 2017. “Rep. Beto O’Rourke is so radical and reckless that he is unfit to serve in the U.S. Senate,” said Sen. Ted Cruz campaign spokesman Emily Miller. “O’Rourke’s extremist views on impeaching the President of the United States put him in the fringe of the liberal movement — even to the left of Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. His calls for impeachment may win him big donors in Hollywood, but it doesn’t reflect the reasonable views of the vast majority of Texans.” ###",Coronavirus: One in four Northern Ireland adults ‘now at risk of hunger and malnutrition’,FALSE

3963580,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating ‘global warming’ by fiddling with the raw temperature data. This time, that data concerns the recent record-breaking cold across the northeastern U.S. which NOAA is trying to erase from history. If you believe NOAA’s charts, there was nothing particularly unusual about this winter’s cold weather which caused sharks to freeze in the ocean and iguanas to drop out of trees. Here is NOAA’s January 2018 chart for Northeast U.S. – an area which includes New England along with NY, PA, NJ, DE and MD. You’d never guess from it that those regions had just experienced record-breaking cold, would you? That’s because, as Paul Homewood has discovered, NOAA has been cooking the books. Yet again – presumably for reasons more to do with ideology than meteorology – NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were. We’re not talking fractions of a degree, here. The adjustments amount to a whopping 3.1 degrees F. This takes us well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda. Homewood first smelt a rat when he examined the New York data sets. He was particularly puzzled at NOAA’s treatment of the especially cold winter that ravaged New York in 2013/14, which he describes here: The cold weather really began on Jan 2nd, when an Arctic front descended across much of the country, and extended well into March. The NWS wrote at the end of the winter: The winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal. This winter comes on the heels of two previous mild winters, making the cold and snow this winter feel that much harsher. Temperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York (Buffalo and Rochester)….. Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region. So why, he wondered, did NOAA have this marked down as only the 30th coldest winter (since 1895) on its New York State charts, with a mean temperature of 16.9F? Homewood compared the local records for January 1943 and January 2014 – months which, according to NOAA’s charts, had very similar average temperatures. What he found was that NOAA’s charts were deeply inaccurate. The 2014 local temperatures had been adjusted upwards by NOAA and the 1943 local temperatures downwards. He concludes: On average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7F less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9F. Somehow, NOAA has adjusted past temperatures down, relatively, by 1.8F. Now, Homewood has given the same treatment to the most recent Big Freeze – the winter of 2017/2018. Yet again, he has found that NOAA’s arbitrary adjustments tell a lie. They claim that January 2018 was warmer in the New York region than January 1943, when the raw data from local stations tells us this just isn’t true. So at the three sites of Ithaca, Auburn and Geneva, we find that January 2018 was colder than January 1943 by 1.0, 1.7 and 1.3F respectively. Yet NOAA say that the division was 2.1F warmer last month. NOAA’s figure makes last month at least 3.1F warmer in comparison with 1943 than the actual station data warrants. He concludes: Clearly NOAA’s highly homogenised and adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better? Well indeed. The key point here is that while NOAA frequently makes these adjustments to the raw data, it has never offered a convincing explanation as to why they are necessary. Nor yet, how exactly their adjusted data provides a more accurate version of the truth than the original data. One excuse NOAA’s apologists make is that weather stations are subject to changing environmental conditions. For example, when the station sited at Syracuse in 1929 was located at what was originally just a sparse aerodrome. Since then, however, as Homewood notes, it has grown into a large international airport with two runways servicing two million passengers a year. Its weather station readings therefore will certainly have been corrupted by the Urban Heat Island effect: that is, its temperature readings will have been artificially elevated by the warmth from the surrounding development and aircraft engines. So you’d think, wouldn’t you, that to compensate for this NOAA would adjust the recent temperatures downwards. Instead, for no obvious reasons, it has adjusted them upwards. This is a scandal. NOAA’s climate gatekeepers are political activists not honest scientists and the U.S. taxpayer has no business funding their propaganda.

bf9f2cd6,"Tony Abbott: Daring To Doubt 2017 Annual GWPF Lecture The Honourable Tony Abbott MP Former Prime Minister of Australia ‘Daring To Doubt’ London, 9 October 2017 Thank you for giving me the same platform that you’ve previously given to fellow Australians John Howard and George Pell. I will strive to be worthy of their example and their friendship; to offer a common sense way through the climate conflict; and, also, to place this particular issue in the broader struggle for practical wisdom now taking place across the Western world. It would be wrong to underestimate the strengths of the contemporary West. By objective standards, people have never had better lives. Yet our phenomenal wealth and our scientific and technological achievements rest on values and principles that have rarely been more widely challenged. To a greater or lesser extent, in most Western countries, we can’t keep our borders secure; we can’t keep our industries intact; and we can’t preserve a moral order once taken for granted. Eventually, something will crystalize out of this age of disruption but in the meantime we could be entering a period of national and even civilizational decline. In Australia, we’ve had ten years of disappointing government. It’s not just the churn of prime ministers that now rivals Italy’s, the internal divisions and the policy confusion that followed a quarter century of strong government under Bob Hawke and John Howard. It’s the institutional malaise. We have the world’s most powerful upper house: a Senate where good government can almost never secure a majority. Our businesses campaign for same sex marriage but not for economic reform. Our biggest company, BHP, the world’s premier miner, lives off the coal industry that it now wants to disown. And our oldest university, Sydney, now boasts that its mission is “unlearning”. Of course, to be an Australian is still to have won the lottery of life, and there’s yet no better place to live and work. But there’s a nagging sense that we’re letting ourselves down and failing to reach anything like our full potential. We are not alone in this. The Trump ascendancy, however it works out, was a popular revolt against politics-as-usual. Brexit was a rejection of the British as well as of the European establishments. Yes, the centrist, Macron, won in France but only by sidelining the parties that had ruled from the start of the Fifth Republic. And while the German chancellor was re-elected, seemingly it’s at the head of an unstable coalition after losing a quarter of her vote. Everywhere, there’s a breakdown of public trust between voters and their leaders for misdiagnosing problems, for making excuses about who’s to blame, and for denying the damage that’s been done. Since the Global Financial Crisis, at least in the West, growth has been slow, wages stagnant, opportunities limited, and economic and cultural disruption unprecedented. Within countries and between them, old pecking orders are changing. Civilizational self-doubt is everywhere; we believe in everyone but ourselves; and everything is taken seriously except that which used to be. Just a few years ago, history was supposed to have ended in the triumph of the Western liberal order. Yet far from becoming universal, Western values are less and less accepted even in the West itself. We still more or less accept that every human being is born with innate dignity; with rights, certainly, but we’re less sure about the corresponding duties. We still accept the golden rule of human conduct: to treat others as we would have them treat us – or to use the Gospel formula to “love your neighbour as you love yourself” – but we’re running on empty. In Britain and Australia, scarcely 50 per cent describe themselves as Christian, down from 90 per cent a generation back. For decades, we’ve been losing our religious faith but we’re fast losing our religious knowledge too. We’re less a post-Christian society than a non-Christian, or even an anti-Christian one. It hasn’t left us less susceptible to dogma, though, because we still need things to believe in and causes to fight for; it’s just that believers can now be found for almost anything and everything. Climate change is by no means the sole or even the most significant symptom of the changing interests and values of the West. Still, only societies with high levels of cultural amnesia – that have forgotten the scriptures about man created “in the image and likeness of God” and charged with “subduing the earth and all its creatures” – could have made such a religion out of it. There’s no certain way to regain cultural self-confidence. The heart of any recovery, though, has to be an honest facing of facts and an insistence upon intellectual rigour. More than ever, the challenge of leadership is to say what you mean and do what you say. The lesson I’ve taken from being in government, and then out of it, is simply to speak my mind. The risk, when people know where you stand, is losing their support. The certainty, when people don’t know where you stand, is losing their respect. Of course, we’re all nostalgic for the days when governments and oppositions could agree on the big issues; but pleading for bi-partisanship won’t create it. As my government showed on border protection policy, the only way to create a new consensus is to argue the case, to make a decision, and then to let the subsequent facts speak for themselves. The modern world, after all, is not the product of a successful search for consensus. It’s what’s emerged from centuries of critical enquiry and hard clash. Without the constant curiosity and endless questioning that has driven our scientists and engineers, and the constant striving for improvement that’s long guided our planners and policy makers, there’d be no cures for disease, no labour-saving appliances, no sanitation, no urban improvement, no votes for women, no respect for minorities; in other words, no modern world. That may not actually bother some green activists whose ideal is an Amish existence, only without reference to God. But it should bother anyone and everyone who wants longer, safer, more comfortable and more prosperous lives. Beware the pronouncement, “the science is settled”. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that “99 per cent of scientists believe” as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. There are laws of physics; there are objective facts; there are moral and ethical truths. But there is almost nothing important where no further enquiry is needed. What the “science is settled” brigade want is to close down investigation by equating questioning with superstition. It’s an aspect of the wider weakening of the Western mind which poses such dangers to the world’s future. Physics suggests, all other things being equal, that an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would indeed warm the planet. Even so, the atmosphere is an almost infinitely complex mechanism that’s far from fully understood. Palaeontology indicates that over millions of years there have been warmer periods and cooler periods that don’t correlate with carbon dioxide concentrations. The Jurassic warm period and the ice ages occurred without any human contribution at all. The medieval warm period when crops were grown in Greenland and the mini-ice age when the Thames froze over occurred well before industrial activities added to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Prudence and respect for the planet would suggest taking care not lightly to increase carbon dioxide emissions; but the evidence suggests that other factors such as sun spot cycles and oscillations in the Earth’s orbit are at least as important for climate change as this trace gas – which, far from being pollution, is actually essential for life to exist. Certainly, no big change has accompanied the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the past century from roughly 300 to roughly 400 parts per million or from 0.03 to 0.04 per cent. Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent. It may be that a tipping point will be reached soon and that the world might start to warm rapidly but so far reality has stubbornly refused to conform to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s computer modelling. Even the high-priests of climate change now seem to concede that there was a pause in warming between the 1990s and 2014. So far, though, there’s no concession that their models might require revision even though unadjusted data suggests that the 1930s were actually the warmest decade in the United States and that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed. The growing evidence that records have been adjusted, that the impact of urban heat islands has been downplayed, and that data sets have been slanted in order to fit the theory of dangerous anthropogenic global warming does not make it false; but it should produce much caution about basing drastic action upon it. Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heat waves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial. In what might be described as Ridley’s paradox, after the distinguished British commentator: at least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm; climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm. Australia, for instance, has the world’s largest readily available supplies of coal, gas and uranium, yet thanks to a decade of policy based more on green ideology than common sense, we can’t be sure of keeping the lights on this summer; and, in the policy-induced shift from having the world’s lowest power prices to amongst the highest, our manufacturing industry has lost its one, big comparative economic advantage. About 20 years ago, in Australia, limiting carbon dioxide emissions first became a goal of public policy. It was the Howard government, back in 1997, that originally introduced the Renewable Energy Target, a stealth carbon tax, requiring energy suppliers to source a percentage of their power from new renewable generation. But in those far off days, it was just 2 per cent. During the energy discussions around the Howard cabinet table, I recall thinking “why not encourage more solar hot water systems to reduce power use” and “why not incentivise the installation of solar panels to help power people’s homes”? Way back in the 1980s, in my final provost’s collection at The Queen’s College, Lord Blake had observed: “Mr Abbott needs to temper his robust common sense with a certain philosophic doubt”. If only more of us had realised sooner how easy it was with renewable power to have too much of a good thing! Unsurprisingly, a conservative cabinet did indeed respond to farmers’ worries about the drought then gripping eastern Australia; and the public’s then eagerness to support environmental gestures with other people’s money. We thought we could reduce emissions, or at least limit their increase, without much disruption to everyday life, hence these gestures to the zeitgeist. Where the subsidy was modest and the impact on the power system minimal, our thinking ran, why not accommodate the feel-good urge to be “responsible global citizens”? In its last few months, the Howard government even agreed in-principle to support an emissions trading scheme. But Howard was shrewd enough to know how the most important consequences of any policy were often the unintended ones. His government’s refusal to ratify the Kyoto climate change treaty, even though we’d secured a good deal for Australia, showed his caution about the impact of emissions reduction on power prices and the wider economy. For the incoming Labor Prime Minister after 2007, though, climate change was nothing less than the “greatest moral challenge of our time”. The Rudd-Gillard government believed in an emissions trading scheme, no ifs, no buts, and in a ten-fold increase in the mandatory use of renewables. For a while, the Liberal-National opposition was inclined to go along with it. My own leaning for the first year or so was not to oppose it; but my doubts about the theory of climate change were growing and my sense that an ETS would turn out to be a “great big new tax on everything” was hardening. To a party audience in country Victoria in October 2009, I observed that the so-called settled science of climate change was “absolute crap”; and after winning the opposition leadership had a secret party room ballot to oppose an ETS because it was not our job to enter into weak compromises with a bad government. As it happened, the 2010 election was more about power prices than about saving the planet. Under great political pressure, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard, declared “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”. But early in 2011, as part of her minority government’s deal with the Greens, she committed to a carbon tax that would put wholesale power prices up by 40 per cent. The 2013 election was a referendum on Labor’s carbon tax – as well as Labor’s complete loss of control over our maritime borders – with a thumping win to the Liberal-National Coalition. In July 2014, the Abbott government abolished the carbon tax, saving the average household about $500 a year. In early 2015, we reduced the Renewable Energy Target from 28 to 23 per cent. It wasn’t enough, but it was the best that we could get through the Senate. My cabinet always had some ministers focussed on jobs and cost of living; and others more concerned with emissions reduction, even though our contribution to global emissions was barely one per cent. Inevitably, our Paris agreement to a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction was a compromise based on the advice that we could achieve it largely through efficiencies, without additional environmental imposts, using the highly successful emissions reduction fund; because, as I said at the time, “the last thing we want to do is strengthen the environment (but) damage our economy”. At last year’s election, the government chose not to campaign on power prices even though Labor was promising a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target (requiring a $50 billion over-build of wind farms) and a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 (requiring a new carbon tax). After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties. Although manufacturing, agriculture and transport are also large carbon dioxide emitters, the politics of emissions reduction has always focussed on power generation because shifting to renewables has always been more saleable to voters than closing down industry, giving up cars and not eating beef. As a badge of environmental virtue, the South Australian state Labor government had been boasting that, on average, almost 50 per cent of its power was wind-generated – although at any moment it could vary from almost zero to almost 100 per cent. It had even ostentatiously blown up its one coal-fired power station. In September last year, though, the wind blew so hard that the turbines had to shut down – and the inter-connector with Victoria and its reliable coal-fired power failed too. For 24 hours, there was a state wide blackout. For nearly two million people, the lights were off, cash registers didn’t work, traffic lights went down, lifts stopped, and patients were sent home from hospitals. Throughout last summer, there were further blackouts and brownouts across eastern Australia requiring hundreds of millions in repairs to the plant of energy-intensive industries. Despite this, in a display of virtue signalling, to flaunt its environmental credentials (and to boost prices for its other coal-fired plants), last March the French-government part-owned multinational, Engie, closed down the giant Hazelwood coal-fired station that had supplied a quarter of Victoria’s power. The Australian Energy Market Operator is now sufficiently alarmed to have just issued an official warning of further blackouts this summer in Victoria and South Australia and severe medium term power shortfalls. But in yet more virtue-signalling, energy giant AGL is still threatening to close the massive Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW and replace it with a subsidised solar farm and a much smaller gas-fired power station relying on gas supplies that don’t currently exist. Were it not rational behaviour based on irrational government policy, this deliberate elimination of an essential service could only be described as a form of economic self-harm. Hydro aside, renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, the power doesn’t flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships; cheaper than powered boats, to be sure, but we’ve stopped using sail for transport because it couldn’t be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable, you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability, so in the absence of industrial scale batteries, it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal, gas, hydro, or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. Also now apparent is the system instability and the perverse economics that subsidised renewables on a large scale have injected into our power supply. Not only is demand variable but there’s a vast and unpredictable difference between potential and dispatch-able capacity at any one time. Having to turn coal fired power stations up or down as the wind changes makes them much less profitable even though coal remains by far the cheapest source of reliable power. A market that’s driven by subsidies rather than by economics always fails. Subsidy begets subsidy until the system collapses into absurdity. In Australia’s case, having subsidised renewables, allegedly to save the planet; we’re now faced with subsidising coal, just to keep the lights on. We have got ourselves into this mess because successive federal governments have tried to reduce emissions rather than to ensure reliable and affordable power; because, rather than give farmers a fairer return, state governments have given in to green lobbyists and banned or heavily restricted gas exploration and extraction; and because shareholder activists have scared power companies out of new investment in fossil fuel power generation, even though you can’t run a modern economy without it. In the short term, to avoid blackouts, we have to get mothballed or under-utilised gas back into the system. In the medium term, there must be – first – no subsidies, none, for new intermittent power (and a freeze on the RET should be no problem if renewables are as economic as the boosters claim); second, given the nervousness of private investors, there must be a government-built coal-fired power station to overcome political risk; third, the gas bans must go; and fourth, the ban on nuclear power must go too in case a dry country ever needs base load power with zero emissions. The government is now suggesting that there might not be a new Clean Energy Target after all. There must not be – and we still need to deal with what’s yet to come under the existing target. In the longer term, we need less theology and more common sense about emissions reduction. It matters but not more than everything else. As Clive James has suggested in a celebrated recent essay, we need to get back to evidence based policy rather than “policy based evidence”. Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s. There’s a veneer of rational calculation to emissions reduction but underneath it’s about “doing the right thing”. Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. So far, climate change policy has generated new taxes, new subsidies and new restrictions in rich countries; and new demands for more aid from poor countries. But for the really big emitters, China and India, it’s a first world problem. Between them, they’re building or planning more than 800 new coal-fired power stations – often using Australian coal – with emissions, on average, 30 per cent lower than from our own ageing generators. Unsurprisingly, the recipients of climate change subsidies and climate change research grants think action is very urgent indeed. As for the general public, of course saving the planet counts – until the bills come in and then the humbug detector is switched on. Should Australia close down its steel industry; watch passively while its aluminium industry moves offshore to places less concerned about emissions; export coal, but not use it ourselves; and deliberately increase power prices for people who can’t install their own solar panels and batteries? Of course not, but these are the inevitable consequences of continuing current policies. That’s the reality no one has wanted to face for a long time: that we couldn’t reduce emissions without also hurting the economy; that’s the inconvenient truth that can now no longer be avoided. The only rational choice is to put Australian jobs and Australia’s standard of living first; to get emissions down but only as far as we can without putting prices up. After two decades’ experience of the very modest reality of climate change but the increasingly dire consequences of the policy to deal with it, anything else would be a dereliction of duty as well as a political death wish. I congratulate the Global Warming Policy Foundation for your commitment to rational inquiry; your insistence that the theory must be made to fit the facts, rather than the other way round; your concern to do good, rather than just to seem good; and for the hope I share with you: that, in the end, the best policy will turn out to be the best politics. I’m reminded of the story of a man randomly throwing pieces of paper from the window of a train. Eventually his companion asked him why he did it. It keeps the elephants down, he said. “But there are no elephants here”, his companion replied. “Precisely; it’s a very successful method”. A tendency to fear catastrophe is ingrained in the human psyche. Looking at the climate record over millions of years, one day it will probably come; whatever we do today won’t stop it, and when it comes, it will have little to do with the carbon dioxide emissions of mankind.",Broward County Sheriff Fired For Lying About Parkland,FALSE

3a802a26,"ADVERTISEMENT The fire that gutted a flank of the Treasury House, office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, was caused by an electric spark at about 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, says. Mr Agba spoke with journalists after the fire was put out. He said the fire started in an office on the third floor of the building. He further explained that the fire occurred “after an officer came to the office. He said he put on the air conditioner and there was a spark and immediately he put it off.” Earlier, the Federal Fire Service announced in a tweet that its team had put out the fire, with combined efforts from sister-agencies. This was buttressed by Mr Agba who said the fire service initially had difficulty getting into the building, but after about 35 minutes the fire was contained. “They got inside and fought the fire. Five fire trucks were used within 35 minutes,” he said. Already, there are subtle innuendos on social media that the fire was staged to excuse the government of accounting for funds meant to fight COVID-19 in the country. But Mr Agba brushed this aside, saying that not only is its data intact, its operations are largely digital. “We have gone round the offices that were affected, our data centre where all our records are fully intact. There is no disruption. For a while now we have gone digital,” the minister added, a mask strapped around his mouth, himself and his audience violating the physical distancing directive. “Even if the data centre were to be affected, we have a backup centre that is outside Abuja, in the event we experience loss of any data. “The only thing that happened to the data centre is the cooling unit which is in the exterior at the back. The cooling unit will be put in order,” he noted, saying that the unit has been closed temporarily. Meanwhile the FCT police commissioner, Bala Ciroma, who also briefed journalists at the scene of the incident, said an investigation into the cause of the fire had commenced. The minister alluded to this, too. He said while “a few documents were burnt,” the extent of the damages is yet to be ascertained.”",How fire gutted Nigeria’s Treasury House — Minister,TRUE

Instead, the data suggests that the historic vote had no significant impact on growth at all.

92b942f7,"There has been a big increase in the number of people being referred to GP surgeries and A&E departments, analysis of the NHS 111 urgent care line in England shows. The figures were produced by the doctors' union the BMA, which has had long-standing concerns over NHS 111. Doctors' leaders say increased referrals mean more pressure on already overstretched GPs and hospitals. NHS England says the 111 service is meeting increasing demand. A spokesman said the proportion of referrals to GPs and emergency services had remained steady despite a surge in calls. But the BMA is concerned that the service is not delivering appropriate advice to some patients and this means some are being incorrectly directed to busy hospitals and GP surgeries. Rising demand NHS 111 signimage copyrightNHS The BMA looked at the outcomes of calls to NHS 111, which was rolled out in March 2013 to replace the old NHS Direct service. In its final full year of operation in 2011-12, NHS Direct received 4.4 million calls from patients. In comparison, calls to NHS 111 increased year-on-year and in 2014 up to November it received and responded to more than 15.4 million calls. Referrals from NHS 111 to A&E increased from just under 400,000 calls in 2013 to over a million in 2014. Similarly, referrals to GPs went up from just under 3 million to 8 million between 2013 and 2014. Non-emergency Dr Charlotte Jones, BMA's GP lead on NHS 111, is concerned that the service is not delivering appropriate advice for patients. There is no doubt that if a patient needs any form of medical care they should be referred through to an appropriate doctor or nurse, but there are serious doubts as to whether this huge increase in workload is clinically necessary. Anecdotally, GPs have reported to the BMA that patients have been referred to them with colds, sore thumbs or other conditions that could have been treated safely by sensible advice over the phone, advising a patient on how to self-care, such as picking up medication from a local pharmacist. And Dr Mark Porter, of the BMA, says there is an issue with staff who have little or no medical knowledge. A fundamental problem with NHS 111 is that it employs non-clinically trained staff who follow a formulaic script rather than using clinical judgement to assess how calls are dealt with. Understandably this is likely to lead the call handlers, with limited experience of medicine, to be cautious and refer patients to the NHS when a trained professional could have encouraged them to effectively self-care. Key NHS services cannot afford to be taking on unnecessary work when they are struggling to treat the number of patients who do need genuine care. It is also an enormous waste of patients' time if they are sent to a GP or A&E when they could have had their issue dealt with during a few minutes on the phone. An NHS England spokesman said the statistics show there is a massive demand from the public for the 111 service. To date, it has coped impressively with this pressure, with the proportion of referrals to GPs and emergency services remaining steady despite the surge in demand. Given this popularity, however, we are continuing to look at ways to make the service even more robust including asking GPs to help support call centres and provide patients with the ability to get high quality medical advice as quickly as possible. Janette Turner, a research fellow for the emergency and immediate care group at the University of Sheffield, said: We must remember NHS 111 is not the same as NHS Direct and of course call volumes are much higher because 111 has not only replaced NHS Direct, but also GP out of hours services. Today's BMA statements are anecdotal and what isn't known is if there was no 111, how many of those people would have actually gone in to their GP, A&E or Walk-In Centres.","Rubio Hails House Passage Of Bill To Defund ObamaCare, Keep Government Open",partially false

239983c1,"To mark one year to go until the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, the International Olympic Committee IOC has put athletes at the heart of this milestone by featuring their preparation and commitment to getting to the Games during these unprecedented times. Athletes narrate and feature in self-filmed content in a film released on this landmark date. They will also hold live chats and take over @Olympics social handles between 4 and 20 February, the period during which next year’s Games will take place. Welcoming athletes from around the world, IOC President Thomas Bach today formally invited the National Olympic Committees NOC of the world and their winter sports athletes to participate in next year’s Games. Respecting the spirit that the Games are a sporting event, it is the IOC President who invites the NOCs to the Olympic Games. Given the current circumstances, this was done today from Olympic House in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC President symbolically signed and sent invitations to eight NOCs, including the Chinese Olympic Committee. The other seven NOCs were the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which is located in the country in which the Olympic Games originated; the NOCs from future Olympic Games host cities – the Japanese Olympic Committee for Tokyo 2020; the Comité National Olympique et Sportif Français for Paris 2024; the Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano for Milano Cortina 2026, the successor of Beijing; and the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee for LA28 – as well as the Australian Olympic Committee and the Nigerian Olympic Committee, which sent the largest delegations from Oceania and Africa respectively to the last Olympic Winter Games. All eight NOCs accepted the invitation via a video message. Speaking about this milestone, Bach said: “One year from now, Beijing will write history as the first city ever to host both the summer and winter editions of the Olympic Games. These Games will connect the Chinese people with the world.” He continued: “Having seen how China is overcoming the coronavirus crisis, we are very confident that our Chinese hosts will ensure safe and secure Olympic Games in full cooperation with the IOC. Every time that I have visited China, I am so impressed by the enthusiasm and support for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. This is why, we can say already now with great confidence: China is ready. Ready to welcome the world’s best winter sports athletes for unforgettable Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. We all are looking forward to this global celebration of sport.” The digitally-led #StrongerTogether campaign focuses on athletes around the world and their solidarity and progress towards the Games. As part of this, the IOC has published the #StrongerTogether film, which showcases athletes’ preparations for next year’s Games, distributed globally across digital, social and partner media channels. Narrated by Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu, it features iconic moments of past Olympic Winter Games, a glimpse of Beijing 2022’s venues, and self-filmed content from athletes’ preparations, as they get ready to go to Beijing 2022. A number of digital partnerships will boost interest in this milestone. Twitter will run a unique emoji feature when users tweet @Olympics with #StrongerTogether and the ❄️ emoji; while a special Beijing 2022 filter will be available on Snapchat. Iconic winter Olympic moments will be released daily on the Olympic Channel and @Olympics Twitter, and there will be athlete takeovers and inspirational talks on the Olympics Instagram. The IOC’s Worldwide Olympic Partners and Rights-Holding Broadcasters will also be activating this landmark over the coming days. Some of the notable activities being organised include the unveiling of a physical countdown clock in Beijing by OMEGA, the Official Timekeeper of the Olympic Games. In addition, fans will be able to interact live with winter athletes, some on their road to Beijing 2022, through the Olympian and Paralympian Online Experiences launched with Worldwide Olympic and Paralympic Partner Airbnb. Omega In China, a One Year to Go celebration show was broadcast on national television. In addition to celebrating this special milestone with a cultural spectacular, the Beijing 2022 Organising Committee also unveiled the official Beijing 2022 torch design. The event was held in the Ice Cube formerly known as the Water Cube, which will host curling at next year’s Games.

All competition venues were completed by the end of 2020, with the remaining renovations and construction to be finished by the end of this year. With the aim of getting 300 million people engaged in winter sports and having received around one million applications for volunteer positions, the Beijing 2022 Games will be transformative for both China and the global winter sports scene. There will be winter sports before the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and a new era of winter sports afterwards. This can already be seen from the numbers. Five years ago, there were only 460 ski resorts in China. This number grew to 644 by the end of 2019. The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will also have a strong emphasis on sustainability. All venues will be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, while natural, low-carbon-emission CO 2 refrigeration systems will be used at most of the Beijing 2022 ice venues – the first time this low climate impact technology will be used in China and at the Olympic Winter Games. Furthermore, 7 out of the 12 competition and non-competition venues within the Beijing 2022 competition zone will be legacy venues from Beijing 2008. Beijing will host the XXIV Olympic Winter Games from 4 to 20 February 2022. ### The International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit, civil, non-governmental, international organisation made up of volunteers which is committed to building a better world through sport. It redistributes more than 90 per cent of its income to the wider sporting movement, which means that every day the equivalent of USD 3.4 million goes to help athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world. ### For more information, please contact the IOC Media Relations Team: Tel: +41 21 621 6000, email: pressoffice@olympic.org, or visit our web site at www.olympic.org.

897917f0,"Free schools are the ‘modern engines of social justice’ helping ‘break the cycle of disadvantage’, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says today 22 May 2015 as she affirms the government pledge to open 500 new free schools this parliament. Speaking on the day the latest application window for teachers, parents and education experts hoping to open a new school opens, Nicky Morgan said free schools are empowering parents to demand more for their children on a scale never seen before. The government has committed to opening 500 more free schools in this parliament, equating to 270,000 additional school places in communities across the country. The new schools, on top of the 254 already opened, will meet the growing demand of parents for more excellent local schools with high standards and strong discipline. Research has also shown they are helping to raise standards in neighbouring schools by introducing fresh ideas and competition to local communities. The government’s education reforms are helping more young people, regardless of their background, to achieve their potential and reach their high aspirations. In the past 2 years the gap in performance between disadvantaged schools and their peers has narrowed at both primary and secondary schools. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: Free schools are at the heart of the government’s commitment to deliver real social justice by ensuring all pupils have access to a world class education. This is at the core of our commitment to govern as one nation - creating a country where everyone, regardless of their background, can achieve their high aspirations. Half of all free schools are in the most deprived areas of the country, offering a fresh chance for families to break the cycle of disadvantage by providing a quality of schooling never before seen in many communities. It is free schools like Dixons Trinity Academy in Bradford, providing an outstanding and innovative education to some of the country’s most deprived children. Or schools like ARK Conway Primary Academy, giving children in Acton the best possible start to life. These are the modern engines of social justice. Parents want the best for their kids, and where they are unhappy with the schools on offer locally the free school programme empowers them to demand more and establish new, high performing, community-led new schools. So I’m calling on all high performing schools, sponsors, charities, community groups and parents to come forward with their proposals for new schools and join us in our shared mission of providing every child with a truly world class education. These brand new schools set up by parents, teachers, charities, academy sponsors and existing schools in response to demand from the local community, either where there is a shortage of places, or where the parents are not happy with the places on offer. So far the programme has resulted in 254 new schools, providing 125,000 places. 72% are located in areas with a shortage of places and half are in the most deprived communities in the country. They are more likely to be rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted than other schools. The free schools programme is also transforming the lives of many of society’s most disadvantaged and disaffected children. 17% of all free schools are dedicated to special needs or alternative provision, giving more help to those most in need. Through its school reforms the government is taking power away from politicians and bureaucrats and handing it to heads and teachers. More than two thirds of free school heads say they are having a positive impact on schools in their local area - driving up standards and ensuring more parents have a great school in their neighbourhood. Policy Exchange research has also shown that the opening of a free school is associated with improvements in local poorly-performing schools, at the same time as providing an excellent education to the pupils who attend the free schools themselves. The government’s plan for education includes introducing new powers to tackle failing schools and improve those that are coasting. Two new measures that will give heads the ability to make an immediate start on improving underperforming schools will be confirmed in the Queen’s Speech next week.

2e16ed0f,"By Tom Hughes Columnist Dave Lister recently suggested that one of our community's most important investment tools -- urban renewal -- was so outdated we should abandon it. Interestingly, he did so by linking it to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Ike was our president from 1953 until 1961. He understood the value of shared investments in important public structures and systems. Ike launched NASA to compete in the space race. The technological advances NASA created are the foundation of our ability to compete in today's technology-driven age. The private jobs created by our investments in NASA support middle-class families across our nation. Eisenhower also signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act, which literally paved the way for $25 billion of investment in 41,000 miles of interstate highways. Our highways support countless jobs and make it safer, faster and easier for all of us to travel. It's impossible to imagine how much poorer and less competitive we would be without our highways. Our nation's investments in roads, bridges, research and other public structures distinguish us from countries in the developing world. Similarly, investments in local communities throughout our own urban region help make the most of our cities, towns and neighborhoods and distinguish us from sprawling regions around the nation. In Portland, urban renewal-based investments in roads, parks, sidewalks and streetcars spurred $3 billion of investment in private projects that repaired dilapidated buildings and created new ones on vacant and underutilized land in the Pearl District. Today, the Pearl supports thousands of homes -- 20 percent affordable -- and many new middle-class jobs. And because people choose to live in the Pearl, we can protect the farms, forests and outdoor recreation opportunities we all enjoy, instead of sprawling like other communities. Public investments -- many funded by urban renewal -- also were essential to Intel's decision to locate in Hillsboro. Intel's facilities increased the community's tax base by $600 million. The company is a key reason our region is the second-fastest-growing exporter in the country. These examples of how our entire community benefits from strategic public investments that support and complement the private sector are no different from the benefits we all get from our highways and space program. And there are many more examples. At a time when federal and state money for the repair and replacement of aging pipes, sewers, potholed streets and schools is dwindling, it's more important than ever that we use every tool available -- including urban renewal -- to make the most of the public structures our parents and grandparents built to support our middle class. If we cast aside the important role of the public sector in creating great communities, it will cost us billions of dollars in lost jobs and productivity, and our children and grandchildren will be poorer as a result. We need more tools, not fewer, to ensure strategic public investments continue to pave the way to prosperity for everyone in our community.

7273a6ce,"Letter to the Editor of The Washington Post by Mr. Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” Dear Mr. Baron, I have to address you with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” by Mr. Philip Bump, published in “The Washington Post” on 25 July 2018, which mentions me personally in the context of a very sensible topic for us – investigation of 2014 Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash in Ukraine. I would like to stress that I am writing this letter in my personal capacity and I am not directly involved in relevant investigative efforts on our side. But even the information that is available in open sources which could be traced by any researcher allows me to make the conclusions that I make. I would not conceal that I was very much disappointed by this publication which clearly does not meet the standards of an unbiased journalist report. Its main message is to illustrate alleged “Russian efforts to undercut findings” of “independent investigators” and “propaganda efforts of Russian government” in general. Needless to say that the article proceeds from the assumption that Russia was behind the downing of MH17 and all our efforts are aimed just at covering up the culprits. I completely disagree with such a narrative and want to clarify several key points in this regard. Since the very beginning Russia was and continues to be genuinely interested in discovering the truth about this tragic event. We supported all the efforts to conduct full and transparent investigation, we exercised our influence on Donbass rebels who, despite very difficult combat situation caused by the Ukrainian authorities’ obsession to punish their own citizens by military force for their desire to preserve their language and culture, provided unhindered and full access to the crash site. All those who wanted to visit it had the opportunity to do so. Every material evidence was also gathered and transported to the Netherlands for the needs of investigation. We from our side provided a lot of information and material to the investigation team, in particular primary radar data. Upon its request Russia disclosed classified information on Buk missiles 9M38 and 9M38M1. Our producer of this ammunition “Almaz-Antey” also modeled the incident and widely shared technical data and the conclusions of this simulation. The Dutch side is also aware of a lot of witness accounts of people living in this area. We expressed and continue to express our readiness to join the group of investigators. Nevertheless, the Dutch investigators since the very beginning showed particular distrust to our findings and contribution. Russian experts were excluded from their work. Much of the data that we provided was ignored and disregarded in the reports. The trend was very clear – to ignore everything that exposed Ukrainian responsibility for the downing of MH17 and to encourage every claim, be it undocumented or even absurd, that Russia or “Russian-backed rebels” were behind it. It is enough to indicate that the investigators do not press the US to provide satellite data from the day and the site of the crush Americans publicly confirmed that they possess such data, but it is “classified” and accept the refusal of Ukraine to provide primary radar data under laughable pretext. Refusal of Ukrainian authorities to close the airspace over the Eastern part of the country at the day of the crash despite ongoing military operation of Ukrainian forces there which is hard to explain by any logic is also disregarded. In the absence of any trustworthy proofs that “Russians did it” the Dutch investigators started to rely more and more on social media and on the findings of investigator groups like Bellingcat which is in the center of the article. To us the whole idea to use social media accounts as a proof in any investigation is extremely bizarre and doubtful. In our days it is not a problem any more to fake any video or photo with easily available software. We also have a lot of reasons not to trust particularly Bellingcat which was repeatedly caught red-handed by Internet users by voicing anti-Russian or anti-Syrian allegations based on fakes. And these fakes are largely exposed in the Web. Internet users have a lot of questions about Bellingcat financing, important American and Western funds that traditionally support anti-Russian campaigns are said to be the main sponsors of these “investigators”, which casts obvious doubt on their impartiality. Besides, there are a lot of other Internet social-media investigators on the Web who claim things opposite to the “findings” of Bellingcat that clearly indicate that Ukraine is behind the downing of MH17. Why are they ignored while Bellingcat accounts are praised and unquestioned? I personally tried to engage with Bellingcat through my Twitter account @dpol_un. But the moment I doubted their impartiality and illustrated upon their request that they produce fakes I faced a vicious verbal attack from them, including their founder Elliot Higgins who, as was claimed in the article “earned international attention for his exhaustive – and accurate – analysis...”. First of all, they said that I do not exist and called me “Kremlin bot” – a usual tactics for those who disrespect the opinion of the others on the Web. I have to say that this “journalist hero” of yours disappointed me most of all sending personal insults through Twitter. I enclose some of the snapshots for your reference. After the bellingcats, their trolls and bots continued to insult me, I had to blacklist some of them, including Higgins. Of course, no apologies followed up to today which is very illustrative of quality of their “work”. How can “responsible investigators” behave like this? There are hundreds of Internet users who already exposed their lies and all the bellingcats do is attack and bully these users. They just do not have other arguments besides insults and pathetic lies. I believe that the fact that you praise their efforts and close the eyes on all the numerous substantiated claims that they produce fakes is not becoming to the reputation of your distinguished paper. Nor it gives any credit to the Dutch investigators. But let’s put aside the bellingcats, let their conscience judge them, they obviously do not deserve so much attention. What worries me most of all is that after four years of the MH17 tragic accident we are still very far from establishing the truth. Unfortunately, the recent push of the Joint Investigation Team to hold Russia responsible on the basis of bellingcats’ findings, inconclusive and missing data from Ukraine and US and with total disregard of our data and documents is another step in this totally wrong direction. And the attempts to exploit the feelings of the relatives of the victims, mobilize them in support of these unsubstantiated claims are absolutely immoral. My country remains ready to join international investigative efforts to find the truth about MH17 crash. We are also consistently supporting the efforts to find those responsible of this crime and bring them to justice. Russia must be part of the investigation team and not its object – nobody has cancelled the presumption of innocence principle. What we do not accept are ultimatums and fakes. Given the fact that my name was quoted in the abovementioned article in a very dubious context I respectfully ask you to publish my letter in your newspaper. I will also make it open and publish it on the website of our Permanent Mission. Sincerely yours, Dmitry Polyanskiy First Deputy Permanent Representative",Ives vs. Rauner: It's on.,FALSE
8fbb7177,"When Gov. Rick Scott addressed an elite group of Florida business leaders at the Willard Hotel in Washington a few nights ago, the doors were shut tight, ensuring that whatever Scott said would not be reported. That was bad. But here's the good news: We now know what Scott told the famously private Council of 100, thanks to Scott himself, and his newfound commitment to sunshine. The key points of Scott's speech and a ""survey"" he gave his guests can be found online as part of ""Project Sunburst,"" the new website that offers the public a glimpse of the massive daily email traffic in and out of the governor's office. ""Intro — priorities,"" reads the first page of Scott's Council of 100 speech, followed by the key points of jobs, education and keeping the cost of living low. The material was in the in-box of a press aide. The Council of 100 cares a lot about higher education, and the group clashed with Scott on two big issues in that policy area. The council favored a bill to let the University of Florida and Florida State University set market-rate tuition, which Scott vetoed, and the group opposed making Florida Polytechnic the state's 12th university, which Scott approved. After his speech, Scott gave the Council of 100 a nine-page survey of questions, many of which were framed so as to put the state's condition in a favorable light. Question No. 1: ""For the two years ending June 2011, what was the average annual change in the total budget of the 11 state universities?"" Five choices followed. The ""right"" answer was plus 9.85 percent, according to Scott. That's Scott spin. The figure is somewhat misleading because it includes universities' rents, concessions and donations. State support for universities, in fact, has been on a steady decline for years. Earlier in the day, university leaders had emphasized to the same Council of 100 that the state now provides 21 percent of the universities' budgets, down from 30 percent four years ago. Scott didn't tell the full story, which we wouldn't have known if the speaking materials weren't online. A lot of the online email is dry stuff, such as weekly reports from the bureaucratic trenches, forwarded copies of news stories. But when editors of most Florida newspapers gush with praise for one of the country's least popular governors, that's a significant development. The Florida Society of News Editors praised Scott for Sunburst, which displays emails to and from Scott and 11 staffers on flgov.com/sunburst (the username and password are both ""sunburst""). ""We want to commend you,"" the editors wrote Scott. ""Your efforts undoubtedly will inspire other public officials and local governments in Florida to follow your lead."" The system is flawed. For example, it would be better if email to and from the governor's budget office could be viewed. But Scott gets credit for improving transparency in government and for setting an example for the rest. The candidate who refused to meet with editorial boards in 2010 now does so often. The governor-elect whose emails were carelessly deleted during his transition to power now lets the public see email online. That's progress.

2855fe5a,"TIJUANA, Mexico — It’s the image from the unfolding crisis in Tijuana seen around the world: a migrant mom and her young children running away from a smoking tear gas canister with barbed wire and a forbidding metal wall in the background. Both children are clad only in T-shirts, and one appears to be wearing a pull-up diaper. One child is barefoot, another wears flip-flops. The woman clutching their arms and dragging them out of harm's way is wearing black leggings and a T-shirt emblazoned with the smiling cartoon faces of the Anna and Elsa from the Disney movie ""Frozen."" That jarring portrait was captured on camera Sunday by veteran Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon moments after a group of Central American migrants approached the border crossing into San Diego and were forced backwards by tear gas canisters hurled by U.S. border agents. ""When the tear gas started, some people were screaming and everybody started running away,” Kim told NBC News on Monday. ""I saw the woman and two children running away. One girl was barefoot from the beginning. The other was wearing beach sandals and lost them in the chaos."" NBC News also tracked down the woman, Maria Mesa, a 39-year-old mother of five from Honduras, inside a tent at the Benito Juarez Shelter in Tijuana. ""I grabbed my children and ran,"" Mesa said of her 5-year-old twin daughters Saira and Sheilly. Mesa said her 3-year-old son James, who does not appear in the picture, was also with them and fainted after getting a lung-full of gas. ""One of them could have died,"" she said. Kim said Mesa ""was travelling with five children."" ""Their father lives in Louisiana and they are trying to reach him,"" he said. Kim's photograph, which appeared on the NBC News website and on the front pages of numerous newspapers, provoked worldwide outrage and appeared to make a lie of President Donald Trump’s claim that the caravans were an invading force of ""criminals"" and ""gang members."" But Trump defended tear-gassing the migrants, calling them ""some very tough people."" Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries.

The wire fence was on the other side of the river about 20 meters away."" Kim said he watched as the mother and the twins started fording the shallow river at the border. Asked if that was why the girls were wearing next to nothing, the photographer said he believes that was all the clothing they had. For a few seconds, Kim said, he was distracted by two men who had already made it across and were using their bare hands and a bucket to dig a hole under a fence so they could crawl under. Then, suddenly, the air was filled with choking smoke. ""One canister fell by the family and they started running away,"" he said, referring to the mother and twins.

He said he stayed with them as they fled back to the migrant encampment. Asked if he was rattled by what he witnessed and the heartbreaking sounds of children crying, Kim said ""my job is to document what is happening."" ""I try not to let my emotions get involved in my work,"" he said. CORRECTION (Nov. 27, 2018, 7:50 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the children in the photograph. One child was wearing sandals; they were not both barefoot. Gabe Gutierrez reported from Tijuana, and Corky Siemaszko from New York City.","A discussion of ‘smokers’ black lungs’ started in the comments today. It’s the widespread belief that smokers’ lungs turn black. Rose pointed out that it all started with James I about four centuries ago. She also dug up some refutations: “Dr. Duane Carr – Professor of Surgery at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, said this: “Smoking does not discolor the lung.” (link) Dr. Victor Buhler, Pathologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Kansas City: “I have examined thousands of lungs both grossly and microscopically. I cannot tell you from examining a lung whether or not its former host had smoked.” (link) Dr. Sheldon Sommers, Pathologist and Director of Laboratories at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York: “…it is not possible grossly or microscopically, or in any other way known to me, to distinguish between the lung of a smoker or a nonsmoker. Blackening of lungs is from carbon particles, and smoking tobacco does not introduce carbon particles into the lung.” (link) And Brigitte even found a Youtube video: There is even this (in German) in which a forensic medic states that these “tar” lungs do not exist. Rich White’s Smoke Screens reports the same: This was confirmed by Dr Jan Zeldenrust, a Dutch pathologist for the Government of Holland from 1951 – 1984. In a television interview in the 1980’s he stated that, translated from Dutch, “I could never see on a pair of lungs if they belonged to a smoker or non-smoker. I can see clearly the difference between sick and healthy lungs. The only black lungs I’ve seen are from peat-workers and coal miners, never from smokers”. smokers-lungs1Nevertheless, the black lungs are all over cigarette packets these days. And black lung disease (or pneumoconiosis) is a real disease. Coal miners get it. So where does the smokers’ black lung idea come from? Part of the answer can be found in a photo-essay on Medicinenet: This photo essay will focus on smoker’s lung. The term “smoker’s lung” refers to the structural and functional abnormalities (diseases) in the lung caused by cigarette smoking. First, the normal structure and function of the lung will be described and illustrated. Then, the structural and functional abnormalities caused by smoking will be described and illustrated. A bit further on the effect of emphysema on lungs is described. emphysemaAs a result, emphysema also disrupts the normal blood supply. Figure 4 contrasts the nasty appearance of a smoker’s emphysematous lung with a normal lung. So it’s emphysema that causes the nasty appearance of a smoker’s emphysematous lung. It continues: As you can imagine, cigarette smoke contains many impurities that are inhaled in great numbers directly into the lung. For this reason, the alveolar spaces of the smoker contain numerous scavenger cells (macrophages) that are filled with engulfed (phagocytized) particles of impurities and debris, as illustrated in Figure 5. Under the microscope, with this high magnification, you can actually see the black and brown engulfed particles in the alveolar scavenger cells. Indeed, smoker’s lung may have so much of this particulate material that the lung looks gray-black to the naked eye. So, most of the time, you don’t need a microscope to tell if someone is or was a heavy smoker. A naked eye examination of a smoker’s lung usually will reveal an enlarged gray-black lung with enlarged air spaces (the emphysema, as you saw in Figure 4 and will see again in Figure 8). I’m not sure why people are asked to ‘imagine’ what’s in tobacco smoke. But since the emphysematous lung has simply been renamed the ‘smoker’s lung’, maybe it’s necessary to explain why it’s turned grey-black. And it’s that imaginary stuff in tobacco smoke that is conjured up to explain it. The lie hinges on first asserting that smoking causes emphysema (it may do, or it may not), and secondly asserting that emphysema turns lungs grey-black (it probably does), and then finally dropping the connecting middle term of ’emphysema’,  and asserting that smoking turns lungs grey-black. Or it’s just calling emphysematous lungs ‘smokers’ lungs’. A parallel false ascription might be found elsewhere. People who visit Delhi may get food poisoning from ingesting bacteria. The food poisoning may cause vomiting and so on. But if the ‘bacteria’ link is missed out, and the malady is just called ‘Delhi belly’ (as it often is), it may mislead people into believing that it’s visiting Delhi (or Indian restaurants) which is the root of the trouble – although in fact most visitors to Delhi (and Indian restaurants) don’t suffer such ill-effects, and there are lots of other places in the world other than Delhi where you can contract ‘Delhi belly’. It’s a thoroughly dishonest and disreputable mis-attribution of a disease. It pins the disease on a particular social group: smokers. And it makes it their disease, and nobody else’s – even though not everyone who gets emphysema is a smoker, and not all smokers get emphysema. But at least we may now see why pathologists aren’t finding grey-black smokers’ lungs: they didn’t have emphysema. But this doesn’t seem to be the only way the black lung lie is propagated. There are also the pigs’ lungs used in demonstrations. I even found an ad for one: The accompanying text helpfully explains: The inflatable swine lungs have been stained realistically and then specially preserved by the BioFlex odorless, nontoxic process that retains the texture and elasticity of fresh lungs. The lungs dramatically and unforgettably demonstrate the effects of prolonged smoking. A palpable simulated internal tumor and a physical simulated external tumor encourage students to feel the texture of the lungs, and to remember that smoking is a known cause of lung cancer. So firstly they’re pig lungs. And secondly they’ve been preserved and stained realistically. And simulated internal and external tumours have been added. And all to demonstrate the effects of prolonged smoking!  It beggars belief. No doubt the students aren’t told any of this, and are led to believe that they’re looking at real human ‘smokers’ lungs’. There are even discussions of the effectiveness of such imagery. Marketing researchers at the University of Arkansas, Villanova University and Marquette University surveyed more than 500 U.S. and Canadian smokers and found that the highly graphic images of the negative consequences of smoking have the greatest impact on smokers’ intentions to quit. The most graphic images, such as those showing severe mouth diseases, including disfigured, blackened and cancerous tissue, evoked fear about the consequences of smoking and thus influenced consumer intentions to quit. “These results suggest that there appears to be little downside on intentions to quit from using extremely graphic pictorial depictions of the negative health outcomes due to smoking,” said Scot Burton, co-author of the study and marketing professor in the Sam M. Walton College of Business. In fact, there may be a downside from using such graphic images, if they have been fraudulently obtained (a consideration which doesn’t appear to have crossed the minds of the marketing researchers). And we’ve just established two methods by which they are fraudulently obtained. And the downside is that, when it is shown that they’re fraudulent, the people who publish them will be accused of fraud, of twisting logic and manufacturing evidence. And when that happens, people will cease to believe not just the fraudulent evidence they have produced, but everything else that they assert too. They will lose all their credibility. Nobody will believe a word they say. That’s quite a big downside, I think. And it’s a downside that doesn’t even seem to have occurred to them. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to the mass media that help propagate these lies that people will cease to believe a word they say either. Nor does it seem to have occurred to the medical profession which allows these lies to be propagated unchallenged that people will cease to believe them too. There’s an awful lot of downside waiting to go down.",TRUE
95020291,"Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele high-fives supporters as he comes out to make a victory speech at Ugly’s Pub in Milwaukee. Credit: Kyle Bursaw / for the Journal Sentinel By of the Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele defeated state Sen. Chris Larson Tuesday, after spending $4 million of his own money since July and loading broadcast airwaves and mailboxes with messages in recent weeks. Abele, 49, was re-elected to a second full four-year term by a wide margin of 12 percentage points. Abele won 56% of the vote to Larson's 44%, according to incomplete results. Abele had placed a close second behind Larson in the four-way February primary. County Comptroller Scott Manske won re-election to a second four-year term. Manske, the former appointed county controller, was not opposed for the office. Abele supporters chanted ""four more years"" after results were announced during an election watch gathering at Ugly's Pub on Old World Third St. ""So what do I owe you for that?"" he said of the work that secured a second term. ""What I owe you is that we're going to think bigger and aim even higher."" Pointing to his administration's project to eliminate chronic homelessness in the county in the next three years, Abele pledged a similar effort to reduce racial disparities in incarceration, housing, employment and education. ""We're going to put a stake in the ground,"" he said. ""Hold me accountable for it."" Larson, 35, had expected to spend about $210,000 on his campaign — a figure dwarfed by Abele's multimillion-dollar campaign. Larson attempted to counter the large spending imbalance by greeting voters at community events and Friday fish fries. Late Tuesday, Larson thanked supporters at Garfield's 502 while jabbing his opponent's well-funded campaign. ""Big money may have won the battle, but they haven't won the war,"" he said. The challenge forced Abele to listen more attentively to the community, according to Larson. ""The Chris Abele that we ran against today is very different than the Chris Abele we were running against six months ago,"" he said. Larson promised to continue the pressure. ""This is a movement. And so, while we didn't win the battle today, we will the war,"" he said. ""We will continue to fight."" Abele pledged to complete the full term, dousing rumors of his interest in running for Wisconsin governor in 2018. Larson did not make the same pledge and had been expected to use this election as a springboard to run for governor in two years. One of Abele's consistent messages was that voters should rehire him based on a record of accomplishment during five years in the office. His list includes: reducing the projected county deficit and cutting annual debt payments; supporting bus transit services without increasing fares; boosting job training programs; adding more than 150 acres of parkland; and ending long-term institutional care of mental health patients at the troubled Mental Health Complex in Wauwatosa. Abele was first elected in 2011 in a special election to fill the final year in Scott Walker's term after Walker was elected governor. Abele was re-elected in 2012 to a full four-year term. As part of his campaign platform, Larson said he would push to add 1% to the sales tax collected here, to 6.6%, to provide dedicated funding for bus transit and parks maintenance, and reduce property taxes. The current 5.6% rate collected in the county is the maximum allowed under state law. With the extra revenue, Larson promised to lower bus fares and expand routes. Abele criticized Larson for promising such dedicated funding with a plan that could not be executed by a county executive without the backing of the Republican-controlled Legislature — an unlikely prospect at best. Rather than raising the sales tax, Abele suggested that the county ask the Legislature to restore state funding to Milwaukee County so that shared revenue and other payments are set at the same rate as other counties. Abele said he had not raised bus fares in his five years in office and had put more property tax dollars into the transit budget to replace cuts in state aid. Larson challenged Abele's collaboration with Republican lawmakers to add county executive authority while undercutting the County Board. His chief complaint of such collaboration is an amendment to the state budget law adopted in July by GOP lawmakers. The amendment gave the Milwaukee County executive authority to sell or lease county-owned land not zoned as a park without county board approval. Such a sale would need the approval of the comptroller or a municipal representative of the community where the land is located. Larson had been endorsed by the Wisconsin Working Families Party, which actively campaigned for him. County Supervisor Marina Dimitrijevic is state director of the group.

dd4501d6,"The rookie politician’s first month looks a lot like his campaign. Congressman Conor Lamb was an unknown quantity when he won a special election in March that he wasn’t supposed to win, having run as a Democrat even Reaganites could love and refusing to fully toe the partisan line. It was a question of how all that would translate in elected office. He had no political experience and no voting record to point to and only platform points and campaign vows to serve as reference material. A month later, and that has changed. In the first weeks of what is to be a very brief term representing the 18th Congressional District — portions of which belong to Allegheny, Westmoreland, Greene and Washington counties — Lamb has voted with his fellow Democrats in the House and at times with the Republican majority. He’s voted in favor of measures to extend hate crime protections to law enforcement officers and against a Farm Bill containing controversial new work requirements for food stamp recipients. He’s voted with Congressman Keith Rothfus, Lamb’s Republican opponent in the ongoing race for Pennsylvania’s newly drawn 17th Congressional District, and against him. So the question is: If Lamb was billed as a political maverick, a moderate in immoderate times, does his voting record reflect that? Here we look at the votes cast by Lamb in his first weeks in office and preview what his votes might look like as a more permanent member of the U.S. House if he’s elected to represent the 17th in November. Multiple requests for comment were not returned. Legislation U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb - Democrat U.S. Rep.

The Volcker Rule was passed as part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 under President Barack Obama and was meant to protect bank customers by preventing institutions from making certain types of speculative investments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. According to the New York Times, “the Volcker Rule, named for the former chairman of the Federal Reserve […] prohibited banks from making their own risky bets with their customers’ deposits. Banks loathed the rule and Republicans vowed to undo it.” The bill works by allowing thousands of small and midsize banks to avoid tougher oversight and, per the Washington Post, “also loosens rules aimed at protecting the biggest banks from sudden collapse.” The Post also reported that Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman for whom the rule is named, criticized a similar bill in the U.S. Senate, saying “plausibly small loopholes can be ‘gamed’ and exploited with unfortunate consequences.” In the end, congressional Republicans succeeded with the help of Democrats like Lamb who was one of 78 Democrats to vote for the rollback. One hundred and fifteen Democrats cast votes against the rule change or didn’t vote at all, according to govtrack.us. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted to rollback the rule and later said at a town hall that his vote was based on the burden the regulation presented for smaller banks that he said don’t engage in the type of risky trading that the big banks did before the financial crisis of 2008, TribLive reported. Under the bill, community banks are defined as those without a controlling entity with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and trading liability that are more than 5 percent of total consolidated assets. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the rollback. Where does it stand? The bill was passed by the House and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, according to congress.gov. S. 2155 – Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act What is it? The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is a more sweeping rollback of Dodd-Frank provisions. It aims to “ease the regulatory burden for small and midsize banks,” the same banks that argue the tougher regulations spurred by the 2008 financial crisis have unfairly made it more difficult for them to operate and compete. This includes community banks whose customers include small businesses, which critics of Dodd-Frank argue have been hurt by curtailed lending to small companies following the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010. Critics of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, meanwhile, argue that it could embolden some of the financial sector’s worst tendencies, the same that contributed to or caused the financial collapse of 2008. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining the vast majority of Democrats. In a press release, Lamb said of the bill: “With common-sense regulations in place to protect the money that consumers deposit, people can have more confidence that their bank will better protect their investments. Banks today are experiencing record-setting profits and it’s only fair that we continue to protect the interests of the taxpayers and avoid another bailout.” WESA described this as Lamb “straddling the partisan divide with two votes on bank rules.” How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining almost all of his fellow Republicans. In a statement, Rothfus said: “Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day. This has meant that consumers have faced higher costs and reduced access to vital financial products. By fixing misguided rules from Washington, this bill will help consumers and small businesses access the financial services they need to live their version of the American Dream.” Where does it stand? President Trump signed the bill into law Thursday. H.R. 5698 – Protect and Serve Act of 2018 What is it? The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 is modeled after a federal hate crime statute and would make it a crime to intentionally target a law enforcement officer based on his “actual or perceived status” as one, CNN reports. Supporters say the bill sends a clear signal that violence against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated. Critics say the language of the bill is too broad and effectively designates any violence against officers a federal hate crime. They also argue that it perpetuates a false narrative of a “war on police” and that police already have substantial protections under state and federal law and do not qualify as a historically persecuted group. How did Lamb vote? Lamb, whose background as a federal prosecutor and Marine Corps JAG officer were regular features of his campaign, voted in favor of the bill. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He was one of 162 Democrats to vote in favor of the bill, while 24 voted against it and seven didn’t vote, according to govtrack.us. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the measure. There were 220 Republicans who cast yes votes for the legislation, 11 who did not, and three who didn’t vote at all. All of the bill’s sponsors were Republicans. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2152 – Citizens’ Right to Know Act of 2018 What is it? This bill requires a state or local government that receives funds under a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and uses such funds for a pretrial services program to annually report to DOJ the amount of money allocated for the pretrial services program and certain information about participating defendants. DOJ must publish the information. Additionally, DOJ must reduce the grant allocation of a state or local government that fails to comply. Supporters argue the bill would provide greater transparency in how federal funds are used by local governments. Critics, including the ACLU, NAACP and Human Rights Watch, say the bill presents “serious privacy concerns” and also “undermines efforts to eliminate or reduce jurisdictions’ reliance on money bail systems.” How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining a majority of Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted yes, along with all but 8 Republican voters in the House. What happened? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 5645 – Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2018 What is it? According to Law 360: The SMARTER Act would eliminate differences between the DOJ and FTC’s approaches to merger challenges by requiring the FTC to litigate contested merger challenges in federal court, rather than through its administrative review process. Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that it provides greater certainty for companies by reconciling the disparate processes used by the FTC and DOJ. Opponents view the proposal as an attack on the FTC’s ability to properly carry out its duties, unnecessarily weakening the FTC by removing this enforcement tool from its powers. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining all but four Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted in favor of the measure in what amounted to a party-line vote. Where does it stand? H.R. 5645 passed the House and was referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2: Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (Farm Bill) What is it? The Farm Bill is a multi-year spending bill covering an array of agricultural and food programs — everything from farm commodity price and income supports, agricultural conservation, farm credit, trade, research, rural development, bioenergy, foreign food aid, and domestic nutrition assistance, the Congressional Research Service reports. This year’s proposal was controversial for its proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the proposed addition of work requirements for SNAP recipients. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure with all 183 Democrats who cast votes May 18. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted no, joining only 30 Republican lawmakers who opposed the measure. “While this bill began necessary reforms to agriculture and nutrition programs, in an era of a nearly $21 trillion national debt, more reforms are needed,” Rothfus said in a statement. “Congress needs to be very careful in how it spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill was a missed opportunity for serious reforms of agricultural subsidy programs.” Of the 30 Republicans to vote no on the Farm Bill proposal, NPR reports many are members of the House Freedom Caucus and that they voted no after failing to get concessions on spending and a future vote on immigration in exchange for their support. Rothfus was a member of the House Freedom Caucus until resigning in 2016. Where does the bill stand? The bill failed in the House in a 198-213 and has yet to be scheduled for further proceedings. H.R. 3053 – Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018 What is it? H.R. 3053 is a bill to authorize the Department of Energy to resume a plan — halted under the Obama administration — to build the Yucca Mountain facility to store radioactive nuclear waste. Supporters of H.R. 3053 say waste is piling up at power plants nationwide because Yucca Mountain is unavailable. Critics point to safety concerns and “government bullying” in explaining their opposition. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted for the bill to restart the program, joining 221 Republicans and 119 members of his own party. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the bill. Where does it stand? Referred to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. H.R. 3144 – To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes What is it? The bill, sponsored by U.S. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, would reverse a federal judge’s order calling for more springtime spill over on dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers in the Northwest to protect endangered salmon. The bill would lock in place management plans that the judge found violated federal environmental laws, according to High Country News. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against it along with 181 out of a total 189 voting Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining all but 8 Republican voters in the House. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.",Large proportion of those referred to UK deradicalisation scheme are under 18,partially false
10fae471,"Nearly 700 more deaths than average were recorded during the 15-day peak of the heatwave in June and July in England and Wales, according to official statistics. Experts said that an increase in deaths is fully expected during heatwaves, but they cautioned that the provisional data requires further analysis to determine if the higher mortality is statistically significant for the summer months. “The heatwave will have been associated with a number of excess deaths,” said Dr Adrian Boyle of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. “The people most at risk in a heatwave are the frail elderly with heart or kidney problems.” The UK is “woefully unprepared” for deadly heatwaves, a cross-party committee of MPs concluded in a report published on 27 July. The MPs said the government had ignored warnings from its official climate change adviser, and that without action heat-related deaths will triple to 7,000 a year by the 2040s. The height of the heatwave was from 25 June to 9 July, according to the Met Office, a run of 15 consecutive days with temperatures above 28C. The deaths registered during the weeks covering this period were 663 higher than the average for the same weeks over the previous five years, a Guardian analysis of data from the Office of National Statistics shows. ONS analysis for previous years indicate hundreds of additional deaths were associated with brief periods of heatwave conditions in July 2016 and June 2017. The full toll of the 2018 heatwave could reach 1,000, according to one prediction. “Although the 2018 data is only preliminary, there seems to have been a concerning increase in the number of deaths,” said Dr Isobel Braithwaite, of the public health charity, Medact. “This fits in with current scientific evidence, which clearly shows that long periods of very warm weather can harm people’s health, particularly at extremes of age and in people with other pre-existing health problems.” “While working in A&E this summer, I saw patients presenting with heatstroke and other conditions that were probably exacerbated by the hot weather, and this obviously places an additional strain on our already struggling health services,” she said. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “Some trusts have reported record numbers of people coming in to A&E, with increased emergency admissions, often for respiratory problems and conditions made worse by dehydration. We have heard concerns about large numbers of people from care homes requiring treatment.” Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents hospital doctors specialising in emergency care , said: “The pressure was real and felt at the frontline. I would not be surprised at all if an effect on mortality is shown. The figure of about 700 would seem very plausible.” He said dehydration can lead to many issues, from dizziness and falls, to an increased risk of infections, heart attacks and strokes. High temperatures can increase air pollution, and some urban areas including London saw alerts issued for ozone pollution. “That can really affect those with respiratory conditions,” Scriven said. The heat also puts NHS staff themselves under pressure, he said. “NHS staff are working in often intolerable conditions. Compounding the heat is the fact that this is prime holiday season and there is little slack in the system regarding staff numbers.” Braithwaite said the 2018 heatwave showed that hospitals and care homes must be made ready to cope with high temperatures. “We now know that the frequency and intensity of heatwaves is set to increase significantly over the coming decades because of climate change, so we have to heed this warning call in order to protect the public’s health,” she said. “We also need to treat the underlying cause of the problem by rapidly cutting emissions.” “The extreme heat has highlighted the shortcomings of ageing buildings, which are not designed or equipped to deal with these conditions,” said Cordery. “Staff and patients are paying the price now for past decisions to delay investment in the NHS estate.” The ONS data records when deaths are registered, not when they occurred, but 77% of deaths are recorded within five days. Even higher levels of excess deaths are seen in the colder months, but the year-to-year variation is lower in the summer months. “We cannot say whether any of these [663] deaths are due to the heatwave or from other causes,” said an ONS spokeswoman. “Causes of deaths data for 2018 will be published next summer and they may provide a better understanding.”",Grand Rapids woman raises money for heart surgery after Spectrum rejects her for transplant,TRUE

And one to which, you will not be surprised to hear, there is not a simple answer. There are no general age limits set for the Olympics across the board. However, different sports' governing bodies can impose age limits which are enforced by the International Sports Federation and approved by the International Olympic Committee. For example, gymnastics requires athletes to be at least 16 years of age. Who is the youngest athlete at this year's Games?

The Nepalese won her 100m backstroke heat, but did not achieve a fast enough time to progress further in the event. London-based Singh was not able to be accompanied by her regular coach Rhys Gormley at the Games, but still relied on his intuition via text message when she suffered a slight wardrobe malfunction before the biggest race of her life. Singh ripped her swimsuit in the minutes before her heat, and said: He's been texting me and sending me instructions. “I had to ask him whether or not I should change it [the suit]. I was trying to pull it up and my nail went through the suit.” On her first Olympic experience, she added: “It was amazing just looking up on that board and seeing my time.” Who is the youngest Olympian ever? Greek gymnast Dimitrios Loundras holds the official title of the youngest Olympian ever, having being among the first ever to compete at the inaugural modern Games in 1896. At 10 years old he won a bronze medal with his team in Athens. Can you be too old to compete at the Olympics?

In the end they won the vote by 319 votes to 303, much to the relief of Mrs May. MPs said they were disgusted by the disgraceful behaviour from the Government. Labour MP Rushanara Ali tweeted the Chief Whip Julian Smith to say: This is no way to treat seriously ill colleagues! And Conor McGinn MP said it was appalling to cancel the long-standing convention. Mrs May has such a slim majority in the House of Commons that any vote can be close. It was said today that Tory whips, who usually pair up people who can't vote because of illness so their absence doesn't affect crunch votes, were refusing to do today, meaning that sick people were forced to come in and be counted. Long-standing traditions usually allow sick MPs to be nodded through without them virtually having to walk through the lobbies physically. They can be driven into the grounds of Parliament and counted by whips without having to get out of the car. But a Labour spokesperson said their requests to do this today had been refused. Just one Labour MP was allowed to miss the vote, and was paired up with a Tory MP. Heavily pregnant Cat Smith MP, who was forced into hospital last night, was told she can't travel and was spared from voting today.

b9ccbcb4,"Though health officials have warned Americans to prepare for the spread of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., people shouldn’t wear face masks to prevent the spread of the infectious illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. surgeon general. But that’s not the only reason Americans may want to think twice about using masks, one expert told MarketWatch. Most people don’t know how to use face masks correctly, and a rush to buy masks could prevent the people who need them most — health care providers — from getting them, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In fact the U.S. surgeon general recently urged the public to “STOP BUYING MASKS!” “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!,” wrote Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Twitter US:TWTR The CDC said last month it doesn’t recommend people use face masks, making the announcement on the same day that first case of person-to-person transmission of coronavirus was reported in the U.S. The CDC recommendation on masks stands, a spokesman told MarketWatch Wednesday, even with the first reported case of a COVID-19 infection in an individual in California who had not been to China or been exposed to a person diagnosed with the virus. “The virus is not spreading in the general community,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Jan. 30 briefing. “We don’t routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness. And we certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus.” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday, “Our advice remains as it has been that the average American does not need a N95 mask. These are really more for health care providers.” N95 masks are tighter-fitting than surgical masks and protect against small particles and large droplets, according to the CDC. Azar said that there are only 30 million N95 masks in the national stockpile, adding that there are “as many as 300 million masks needed in the U.S. for health care workers.” There were 86 cases of COVID-19 and two reported deaths in the U.S., as of Monday. See also: Alpha Pro Tech’s stock rockets as coronavirus outbreak leads to a big spike in face mask orders Americans don't seem to be heeding health officials’ advice: Walgreens US:WBA and Duane Reade pharmacies have seen increased demand for face masks and hand sanitizer across the country, said Alexandra Brown, a spokeswoman for Walgreens, which owns both chains. “We continually and closely monitor these types of situations to ensure that we have sufficient supply of those products,” she said. Several sites have sold out of face masks entirely. Target’s US:TGT brand of face masks, priced at $5.99 for a 10-pack, were out of stock on its site as of Thursday. A Target spokeswoman declined to comment on when the face masks would be back in stock. There were still some face masks available on Amazon US:AMZN last Thursday, though many were quickly becoming out of stock. A pack of 20 3M US:MMM face masks was available for $129 on Thursday morning, but by midday it had sold out. In April last year the same pack of masks cost $9.99, according to camelcamelcamel.com, a site that tracks historic prices of goods sold on Amazon. Amazon and 3M did not respond to requests for comment on when customers could expect to purchase masks that are currently out of stock. To protect against a mask shortage, Home Depot US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD has “limited purchase quantity to 10 [masks] per person to best serve as many customers as possible,” said Margaret Smith, a Home Depot spokeswoman. “Our merchandising and supply chain teams are working hard to replenish these items as quickly as possible.” CVS US:CVS has also seen a surge in sales of face masks. The demand “may cause shortages at some store locations and we’ll re-supply those stores as quickly as possible,” Stephanie Cunha, a CVS spokeswoman, said last month. Adalja applauded the CDC’s recommendation on face masks. “Even during H1N1 [flu epidemic], there was no recommendation to wear face masks,” he said. They “end up creating a false sense of security and most people don’t wear them appropriately,” he said. People who are not in the medical field who wear the masks often come in contact with germs when they lift the mask up to eat or slip their fingers under the mask to blow their nose, he said. Panic-driven demand for face masks, Adalja said, is particularly worrisome because it could have “a negative supply shock” effect on hospital personnel who need these masks more than the general public. Like the surgeon general, Adalja said, “the best ways [for the general public] to protect themselves are the basic hygienic measures.” That includes washing your hands regularly and covering sneezes and coughs. But if you are “sick and need to go out you should wear a mask.” Instead of wearing face masks, the general public should “be vigilant to the symptoms and signs of this novel coronavirus, that is, a fever and cough, and if you have those symptoms, please call your health-care provider,” Messonnier said last month. “We want our actions to be evidence-based and appropriate to the current circumstance,” she said, which she said did not justify the use of face masks for people who have not been directly exposed to the virus. The CDC has said it expects to see more coronavirus cases in the U.S. “It’s not so much a question of if … but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness, Messonnier said on Feb. 25. There are still many unknowns about how this strain of coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, spreads, but when person-to-person spread has occurred in the past, “it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread,” the CDC said on its website. Like the CDC, the World Health Organization advises people to wear a mask only if they are displaying symptoms of coronavirus or “taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.” In a separate update last month, the WHO gave instructions for how to appropriately wear and dispose of face masks. WHO also noted, “However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted.” WHO advises people who wish to wear a mask to place the mask “carefully to cover mouth and nose and tie securely to minimise any gaps between the face and the mask,” avoid touching the mask while you’re wearing it, and dispose of masks as soon as they become damp or humid. When removing the face mask, WHO recommends that people “do not touch the front but remove the lace from behind.” Worldwide, 89,197 people have been infected with COVID-19, and at least 3,048 have died as of Monday.

bc965c6b,"Working with the Keystone State's conservatives in Congress, President Trump has signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history. Our administration has eliminated 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the books. Vice President Mike Pence addresses the crowd at the America First Policies event in Rosemont, Ill.Charles Rex Arbogast / AP Photographer, File by Mike Pence, For the Inquirer
Published Jul 22, 2018 When I visit Philadelphia on Monday, I will deliver an important message to the hardworking men and women of the Keystone State: Our agenda is delivering real results – and we're just getting started. Simply look at the historic tax cuts that President Trump signed last December. With the strong support of every Pennsylvania Republican in Congress, we enacted the largest tax cuts and reform in American history.
Under our tax cuts, the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is now 100 percent income-tax free, nearly double what it was before. We also increased the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. And we cut out the core of ObamaCare by eliminating the individual mandate tax, so Pennsylvanians will no longer be forced to buy government-mandated health insurance you don't want and can't afford. All told, the typical family of four in the Philadelphia area will save nearly $2,500 on their taxes every single year. This is a win for working families. It means a down payment on a car, a new refrigerator, or saving a little bit more for your kids' education. We also cut taxes on job creators of all sizes. Businesses across the Keystone State and around the nation have already responded with renewed investment in their workers. Nationwide, more than 6 million Americans — including at least 73,000 Pennsylvanians – have received bigger pay raises, better benefits, and cash bonuses because of our tax cuts.
But this is just the beginning. As businesses continue to invest their tax-cut savings in their workers, we estimate that annual wages for Pennsylvania families will rise by more than $4,200 in the years ahead. The Keystone State is represented by strong Republican leaders in our nation's capital who helped pass our tax cuts, including Congressman Lou Barletta. Rep. Barletta and his Republican colleagues stood with President Trump to put more money in the pockets of working families and job creators, and they deserve Pennsylvania's thanks. The same can't be said of Sen. Bob Casey. Sen. Casey voted against cutting your taxes – and time and again, he votes against the policies that Pennsylvania's working families need.
The evidence is clear: Our tax cuts are working for Pennsylvania, and so is the rest of our agenda. Working with the Keystone State's conservatives in Congress, President Trump has signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history. Our administration has eliminated 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the books. We've also unleashed affordable American energy to power our factories, farms, and homes. We're standing up to predatory trade practices from countries, such as China, and we're fighting tirelessly to break down trade barriers, so Pennsylvania farmers and manufacturers have new opportunities to expand and export and create more jobs right here in Philadelphia.
The results have been extraordinary. Since the Keystone State voted to send President Trump to the White House, America's job creators have added nearly 3.7 million new jobs. More than 115,000 have been created in Pennsylvania alone –including more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs. And the unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded. But for all we've done, there's still more work to do. The good people of Pennsylvania can be assured that we will continue to keep our promises to you. President Trump made that clear once again when he nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be the next justice on the Supreme Court. Like all the principled jurists who we've put on the federal courts, Judge Kavanaugh will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. Under President Trump, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. In the days ahead, with the continued support of the hardworking men and women of Pennsylvania, we'll finish what we've started, and we will Make America Great Again. Mike Pence is Vice President of the United States of America.","REVEALED: Britain's immigration crisis laid bare as 12,000 asylum seekers VANISH",partially false
dfb54ed9,"Muslim women are the most economically disadvantaged group in British society, according to a report by MPs. Ministers must introduce a plan to tackle the inequalities before the end of the year, the Women and Equalities Committee said. Figures suggest they are three times more likely to be unemployed jobseekers than women generally, and twice as likely to be economically inactive. The government said it was committed to making Britain work for everyone. Progress has been made, with 45% more Muslim women in work than in 2011, but ministers know there is much more to do, a government spokesman added. 'Discrimination' Many Muslim women in Britain face a triple penalty impacting on their job prospects - being women, being from an ethnic minority and being Muslim, the committee suggested. It cited Office for National Statistics ONS figures for 2015, which found 35% of all Muslim women from 16 to 64 were in employment. By contrast, 69% of all British working-age women were in employment between March and May this year. The starkest comparison was in the proportion of women who are classed as economically inactive - that is, unemployed and not seeking work. The 2015 ONS figures found that 58% of Muslim women were economically inactive. By contrast, 27% of all working-age women in the UK were economically inactive between March and May. The percentage of Muslim women unemployed and seeking work was 16%, the ONS found - compared with 5% of women nationally. The unemployment rate is calculated as a percentage of those who are economically active. The figures suggest Muslim women are the least economically successful group in British society, the report added. The report cited Demos's analysis of the 2011 Census which found that nearly half 44% of economically inactive Muslim women are inactive because they are looking after the home; this compares with a national average of 16% of women who are inactive for this reason. The report cited a number of contributing factors: Family pressures: There was a conventional cultural acknowledgement among Muslims that women are homemakers and men are breadwinners, academics told the committee Islamophobia: Evidence suggested the biggest cause of the acute disadvantage felt by Muslim women was their religion, and impact of Islamophobia on Muslim women should not be underestimated Recruitment discrimination: Muslim women can face discrimination based on their name, religious or cultural dress, and are more likely to be asked about marriage, childcare or family aspirations, the MPs suggest Role of mosques: Some mosques were failing to involve Muslin women in the way they were run, which could have a negative impact on attitudes and women's attempts to find work, the report said Poverty and language barriers: The committee heard evidence that English language skills continue to be a barrier for some, and poverty disproportionately affects the Muslim population line 'Not a nice feeling' media captionTwo British Muslim women have been talking about their experience of the workplace A 21-year-old Muslim graduate from Manchester has spoken to BBC News anonymously about what she believes was discrimination when she applied for a sales job. She said: There were two phone interviews... and I got brilliant feedback. They said 'You sound absolutely perfect for this role' and said I was very articulate - that kind of thing. But the 21-year-old said that when it came to a face-to-face group interview, during which she was the only person wearing a headscarf, there was a change in the tone. I felt they were strange, and there was a bit of a change in the atmosphere, and that was not a nice feeling for me, she said. She did not get the position. It has lessened my confidence a little bit when going for face-to face interviews, I definitely think I'm more confident over the phone, she added. line The report refers to a chill factor where the perception and fear of discrimination or hostile work colleagues puts Muslim women off applying for certain jobs. The MPs called on ministers to roll out name-blind recruitment to all employers, so that recruiters do not see applicants' names, following evidence that job applicants with white-sounding names are more likely to get an interview. Married women in Muslim communities are often expected to be home-makers while their husbands are the breadwinners, the committee heard from expert witnesses. The impact of the very real inequality, discrimination and Islamophobia that Muslim women experience is exacerbated by the pressures that some women feel from parts of their communities to fulfil a more traditional role, the committee said. But Faeeza Vaid from the Muslim Women's Network stressed that while family pressure may be an issue for a small proportion of Muslim women, many other women were breaking stereotypes in a wide range of roles from doctors to pilots. The committee said attitudes were changing, but not fast enough, saying the government must introduce a plan to tackle the inequalities faced by Muslims by the end of the year. We call on the government to introduce a role models and mentoring programme aimed at Muslim women to help them realise their potential in employment, the report said. Maria Miller, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, said: Muslim women particularly, face really unacceptable levels of discrimination and that discrimination comes from the workplace, from employers, but also from within communities as well.","While novel coronavirus cases have spiked across several parts of Europe, including Spain, France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, Sweden—where a countrywide lockdown was never issued—continues to report a downward trend in new cases and new deaths.

f0b542c4,"SHARE By of the Waukesha - Frustrated board members of the state's flagship jobs agency groped for solutions Wednesday to repeated criticism of their poor financial controls, while key lawmakers in the statehouse called for restricting $14 million in new money until the agency comes up with answers. In the morning, the board of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. met at a hastily called meeting in a state office building in Waukesha about a week after the Legislative Audit Bureau released a stinging report on the jobs agency, which was created in July 2011 by Gov. Scott Walker and lawmakers as a replacement for the Department of Commerce. After more than three hours of discussion, the board resolved to form three new committees to oversee policies, credit decisions and contracts. The existing compensation and benefits committee will review candidates for executive-level jobs, including the open chief financial officer position. WEDC has had abrupt and embarrassing turnover in both its CFO and spokesman positions in recent weeks. Walker, the board's chairman, directed Reed Hall, WEDC's top executive, to ask the Legislative Audit Bureau to meet with and provide guidance to the agency's board and key staff members. ""This board is going to play a much more active role,"" Walker said. The Legislature's Joint Finance Committee is slated to decide WEDC funding as part of the state budget on Thursday. Rep. John Nygren (R-Marinette), a co-chairman of Joint Finance, said Assembly Republicans want to restrict the $14 million in new state money from going to WEDC over the next two years until the agency can show it has a plan to overcome problems disclosed in the recent audit and other reviews. With that additional money, the WEDC would receive a total of $128 million over two years. The Assembly proposal still needs to be negotiated with Senate Republicans. But Nygren, co-chairman of the finance committee, said WEDC should continue getting its current funding levels, saying the agency is a ""proven job creator"" that has faced challenges because it just started up. However, Nygren wants to set any new money aside until the budget panel approves the agency's turnaround plan. ""It's on them,"" Nygren said of WEDC. Recent federal statistics have shown Wisconsin lagging behind most other states in the nation on job creation. Spokesman Tom Evenson said that Walker backed the Assembly Republican position. Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), a budget committee member, said the Nygren proposal was better than doing nothing but still wasn't enough to reform the WEDC. ""It is weak tea,"" Shilling said of Nygren's plan. Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) co-chairwoman said that she also backed withholding new money for the WEDC. ""They're going to have to prove to us that they've seriously reformed and addressed the issues that were raised,"" Darling said. At the WEDC board meeting, agency officials said newly hired vice president of risk and credit Jake Kuester is revamping procedures for contracts involving tax credits, loans, grants and other programs. The agency is also overhauling its reporting and information technology systems. Facing a line of TV cameras and reporters, WEDC had seven staff people and five vice presidents answering questions. The agency also provided a 22-page table with its responses to more than 100 of the audit findings. Several board members said that they haven't been getting enough timely information from agency staff to fulfill their duties to taxpayers and the public. Hall said in an interview following the meeting he is confident the agency has been fully complying with state laws during the last few months. ""There are already bills circulating in the Legislature to require an audit every year of WEDC,"" said Sen. Julie Lassa (D-Stevens Point), a WEDC board member. The Legislative Audit Bureau audit is the fourth report to evaluate WEDC since its problems began to surface a year ago. Walker said after the meeting there are a number of things he would have done differently on the administrative side when the agency formed, but that taking more time to get it going would not have helped with job creation. As frustrating as the problems and the scrutiny have been, Wisconsin companies say they are pleased when working with WEDC staff, Walker said. The situation also provides an opportunity to develop more transparency with ""clear expectations, clear policies and clear follow-up,"" he added.

238ef94f,"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead. Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House. “It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.” Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press. “It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.” Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder. “He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.” No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors. (Photo courtesy of Shelby Bell.)

c5a4ee2d,"If you needed any more proof that the migrant caravans at our Southern border are NOT what they appear to be, now these invaders are making a new demand. Now these “migrants” are saying “give us $50,000 each to return home, or else we’ll bust down your border,” as Fox News reports: Two groups of Central American migrants marched to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana on Tuesday with a list of demands, with one group delivering an ultimatum to the Trump administration: either let them in the U.S. or pay them $50,000 each to go home, a report said. Among other demands were that deportations be halted and that asylum seekers be processed faster and in greater numbers, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The first group of caravan members, that included about 100 migrants, arrived at the consulate around 11 a.m. Alfonso Guerreo Ulloa, an organizer from Honduras, said the $50,000 figure was chosen as a group. “It may seem like a lot of money to you,” Ulloa told the paper. “But it is a small sum compared to everything the United States has stolen from Honduras.” Now the solution is clear. Protect our border with deadly force, force these folks back home without a penny. Under no circumstances should these invaders be let in. A letter from the second group of about 50 migrants arrived at the consulate around 1:20 p.m. asking the U.S. to speed up the asylum process and to admit up to 300 asylum seekers each day at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego. Currently, around 40 to 100 are admitted. “In the meantime, families, women and children who have fled our countries continue to suffer and the civil society of Tijuana continue to be forced to confront this humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis caused in great part by decades of U.S. intervention in Central America,” the letter states. Of the roughly 6,000 migrants who’ve traveled from Central America to Tijuana, around 700 have returned home, 300 have been deported and 2,500 have applied for humanitarian visas in Mexico, according to Xochtil Castillo, a caravan member who met with Mexican officials Tuesday.

286dcb31,"The money that lawyers make has shot up by nearly a quarter in just five years, it was revealed yesterday. Despite strikes by barristers over their pay levels and protests from senior lawyers who demand greater taxpayer subsidies, the legal profession has been booming, according to official figures. They show that last year lawyers across Britain achieved a turnover of £32.2 billion – almost 24 per cent more than the £26.0 billion they earned in 2011. Last year lawyers across Britain achieved a turnover of £32.2 billion – a huge rise in five years The disclosure of the scale and speed at which lawyers have been increasing income drew scathing criticism from some critics of the exploitation of ‘no win no fee’ deals and other new means by which lawyers earn their fees. One said the legal profession has ‘lost its way morally.’ But bodies representing solicitors and barristers said their earnings were vital to the UK economy. The cash rolling in to law firms and chambers means that the earnings of the legal profession are now higher than last year’s £27 billion Ministry of Defence budget for running the army, navy and air force. At the same time numbers of lawyers working in England and Wales have been rising fast. Figures provided by a legal watchdog say that in April 2015 there were 142,109 solicitors and 15,237 barristers. Together with paralegals and auxiliaries, the count shows there were 171,198 people working in the legal profession. They far outnumber regular police officers – 126,818 last spring – or regular service personnel, 153,720 in April last year. Just a decade ago, in 2004, there were 96,757 solicitors and 11,564 barristers, according to Whitehall figures. This means that over the 10-year period – during which legal chiefs regularly complained about the financial pressures on their profession and the difficulties for young people in making careers in the law – the number of solicitors rose by 47 per cent, and the number of barristers by 32 per cent. The figures on legal turnover and numbers were released by the Legal Services Board, which oversees legal regulation in England and Wales. Its turnover numbers were taken from figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics. They were made public following years of protest from leaders of the legal profession over cuts to the taxpayer-funded legal aid budget, which were accused of impoverishing criminal lawyers and preventing the public from getting ‘access to justice’. Former Justice Secretary Michael Gove abandoned the attempt to save £100 million from the £1.6 billion legal aid total at the beginning of this year. The plans would have meant reducing fees for lawyers representing suspects in police stations and slashing numbers of contracts for duty solicitors. Lawyers’ campaigning against legal aid cuts included a series of strikes by barristers who protested that some of their number earned as little as £13,000 a year – although one picket line protest outside the Old Bailey was marred when one barrister joined in carrying a £1,100 Mulberry handbag. Dr David Green, director of the Civitas think tank and author of a recent book on the direction of the legal profession, said that the spread of no win no fee deals and, more recently, ‘damages-based agreements’, had undermined the ethos of the legal profession. The figures on legal turnover and numbers were released by the Legal Services Board ‘It was never the case in the past that lawyers could do what they do now, take a percentage of the damages,’ Dr Green said. ‘It used to be considered wrong and barristers used to fight against the idea that they would be paid a share of the spoils rather than a straightforward fee. ‘The law has become a massive gravy train, and disputes are now regarded by lawyers not as an occasion for the application of justice but as an opportunity to make money. The legal profession has lost its way morally.’ However the Law Society, the professional body for solicitors, said: ‘The legal profession makes a vital contribution to UK PLC – the legal sector grew at 3.3 per cent every year for the last decade compared with 1.2 per cent in the wider economy. ‘An estimated 370,000 people are employed in legal services in the UK. Every 100 extra jobs in legal services supports a further 67 jobs to the wider economy.’ A spokesman added: ‘This healthy growth was influenced by a number of factors between 2012 and 2015. The main drivers include the increase in business transactions which often require expert legal advice. There has also been a significant hike in house sales which has boosted the amount of conveyancing work undertaken by law firms in a highly competitive market.’ Chantal-Aimée Doerries, chairman of the Bar Council which represents barristers, said: ‘It is important to recognise that whereas the overall income of the legal profession has risen, largely due to increasing demand for international legal services, there are sectors of the profession that are suffering, notably those that are committed to providing services to the economically weakest in our society. ‘As a result of successive governments making substantial cuts to legal aid for criminal cases, and the complete removal of legal aid in many social welfare and family areas, many citizens have been deprived of legal representation, and of meaningful access to justice. A further impact of the radical cuts to legal aid is that the professions are doing more than ever pro bono.",Casey Anthony Pregnant With Twins,partially false
142069c9,"One in four women develop mental health problems while pregnant, a study has found. Awareness is growing about post-natal depression – but few people know problems can arrive before the baby is born. Researchers at King’s College London diagnosed mental health problems among 27 per cent of pregnant women. Using a gold-standard psychological screening technique at midwife appointments, they found 11 per cent of women had depression, 15 per cent had anxiety, 2 per cent had eating disorders and 2 per cent obsessive-compulsive disorders, with many women having combinations of different problems. These are usually missed because people wrongly believe women always suffer a feel-good ‘glow’ when they become pregnant. One in four women develop mental health problems while pregnant, a study has found. Awareness is growing about post-natal depression – but few people know problems can arrive before the baby is born ‘This is a myth,’ said researcher Professor Louise Howard, of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King’s. ‘People think that pregnancy is protective of mental health, and then the post-natal period is a trigger for problems. But in reality problems start during pregnancy or even earlier – it is very common.’ She said rare and serious forms of mental disorders – such as severe post-natal psychosis – may be triggered by childbirth. But less severe depression and anxiety are likely to start during pregnancy itself. Clinical psychologist Dr Camilla Rosan of the Mental Health Foundation, an expert in maternity, said pregnancy was a huge transformation in a woman’s life. ‘It’s a time of lots of changes,’ she said. ‘There is a major renegotiation of a woman’s identity, anxiety about what kind of mother she might be, and it sometimes reactivates problems from her own childhood. These are all potential triggers – and old traumas and pre-existing problems can also return.’ Crucially, she said, women are at a vulnerable point in their lives. And the impacts of depression or anxiety can have lasting effects on women and babies. ‘When you experience stress when you are pregnant it leads to changes in levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Studies show these can have an impact on the development of the growing baby' She said: ‘When you experience stress when you are pregnant it leads to changes in levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Studies show these can have an impact on the development of the growing baby – it can affect their later academic achievements and cause problems with the development of emotional relationships.’ The study, funded by the research arm of the NHS and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, involved 545 pregnant women in South London. Professor Howard said women are seen so often by medical professionals during pregnancy they should never slip through the net. Her study showed using proper psychological screening tools, based on simple questions about mood, could pick up problems. ‘In clinical practice, maternity professionals need to identify whether or not a woman has any mental disorder, not only mood disorders which until recently have been the main focus of concern. ‘Women should be asked, by a non-judgemental and supportive health professional, at all contacts in pregnancy and after birth about their emotional wellbeing.’",Poll: Sanders edging Clinton out in California,partially false
43174fe2,"What is occurring on Wall Street right now is truly remarkable. For over 10 days, in the sanctum of the great cathedral of global capitalism, the dispossessed have liberated territory from the financial overlords and their police army. They have created a unique opportunity to shift the tides of history in the tradition of other great peaceful occupations from the sit-down strikes of the 1930s to the lunch-counter sit-ins of the 1960s to the democratic uprisings across the Arab world and Europe today. While the Wall Street occupation is growing, it needs an all-out commitment from everyone who cheered the Egyptians in Tahrir Square, said “We are all Wisconsin,” and stood in solidarity with the Greeks and Spaniards. This is a movement for anyone who lacks a job, housing or healthcare, or thinks they have no future. Our system is broken at every level. More than 25 million Americans are unemployed. More than 50 million live without health insurance. And perhaps 100 million Americans are mired in poverty, using realistic measures. Yet the fat cats continue to get tax breaks and reap billions while politicians compete to turn the austerity screws on all of us. At some point the number of people occupying Wall Street — whether that’s 5,000, 10,000 or 50,000 — will force the powers that be to offer concessions. No one can say how many people it will take or even how things will change exactly, but there is a real potential for bypassing a corrupt political process and to begin realizing a society based on human needs — not hedge fund profits. After all, who would have imagined a year ago that Tunisians and Egyptians would oust their dictators? At Liberty Plaza, the nerve center of the occupation, more than 1,000 people gather every day to debate, discuss and organize what to do about our failed system that has allowed the 400 richest Americans at the top to amass more wealth than the 180 million Americans at the bottom. It’s astonishing that this self-organized festival of democracy has sprouted on the turf of the masters of the universe, the men who play the tune that both political parties and the media dance to. The New York Police Department, which has deployed hundreds of officers at a time to surround and intimidate protesters, is capable of arresting everyone and clearing Liberty Plaza in minutes. But they haven’t, which is also astonishing. That’s because assaulting peaceful crowds in a public square demanding real democracy — economic and not just political — would remind the world of the brittle autocrats who brutalized their people demanding justice before they were swept away by the Arab Spring. And the state violence has already backfired. After police attacked a Saturday afternoon march that started from Liberty Plaza the crowds only got bigger and media interest grew. The Wall Street occupation has already succeeded in revealing the bankruptcy of the dominant powers — the economic, the political, media and security forces. They have nothing positive to offer humanity, not that they ever did for the Global South, but now their quest for endless profits means deepening the misery with a thousand austerity cuts. Even their solutions are cruel jokes. They tell us that the “Buffett Rule” would spread the pain by asking the penthouse set to sacrifice a tin of caviar, which is what the proposed tax increase would amount to. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have to sacrifice healthcare, food, education, housing, jobs and perhaps our lives to sate the ferocious appetite of capital. That’s why more and more people are joining the Wall Street occupation. They can tell you about their homes being foreclosed upon, months of grinding unemployment or minimum-wage dead-end jobs, staggering student debt loads, or trying to live without decent healthcare. It’s a whole generation of Americans with no prospects, but who are told to believe in a system that can only offer them Dancing With The Stars and pepper spray to the face. Yet against every description of a generation derided as narcissistic, apathetic and hopeless they are staking a claim to a better future for all of us. That’s why we all need to join in. Not just by liking it on Facebook, signing a petition at change.org or retweeting protest photos, but by going down to the occupation itself. There is great potential here. Sure, it’s a far cry from Tahrir Square or even Wisconsin. But there is the nucleus of a revolt that could shake America’s power structure as much as the Arab world has been upended. Instead of 1,000 to 2,000 people a day joining in the occupation there needs to be tens of thousands of people protesting the fat cats driving Bentleys and drinking $1,000 bottles of champagne with money they looted from the financial crisis and then from the bailouts while Americans literally die on the streets. To be fair, the scene in Liberty Plaza seems messy and chaotic. But it’s also a laboratory of possibility, and that’s the beauty of democracy. As opposed to our monoculture world, where political life is flipping a lever every four years, social life is being a consumer and economic life is being a timid cog, the Wall Street occupation is creating a polyculture of ideas, expression and art. Yet while many people support the occupation, they hesitate to fully join in and are quick to offer criticism. It’s clear that the biggest obstacles to building a powerful movement are not the police or capital — it’s our own cynicism and despair. Perhaps their views were colored by The New York Times article deriding protestors for wishing to “pantomime progressivism” and “gunning for Wall Street with faulty aim.” Many of the criticisms boil down to “a lack of clear messaging.” But what’s wrong with that? A fully formed movement is not going to spring from the ground. It has to be created. And who can say what exactly needs to be done? We are not talking about ousting a dictator; though some say we want to oust the dictatorship of capital. There are plenty of sophisticated ideas out there: end corporate personhood; institute a “Tobin Tax” on stock purchases and currency trading; nationalize banks; socialize medicine; fully fund government jobs and genuine Keynesian stimulus; lift restrictions on labor organizing; allow cities to turn foreclosed homes into public housing; build a green energy infrastructure. But how can we get broad agreement on any of these? If the protesters came into the square with a pre-determined set of demands it would have only limited their potential. They would have either been dismissed as pie in the sky — such as socialized medicine or nationalize banks — or if they went for weak demands such as the Buffett Rule their efforts would immediately be absorbed by a failed political system, thus undermining the movement. That’s why the building of the movement has to go hand in hand with common struggle, debate and radical democracy. It’s how we will create genuine solutions that have legitimacy. And that is what is occurring down at Wall Street. Now, there are endless objections one can make. But if we focus on the possibilities, and shed our despair, our hesitancy and our cynicism, and collectively come to Wall Street with critical thinking, ideas and solidarity we can change the world. How many times in your life do you get a chance to watch history unfold, to actively participate in building a better society, to come together with thousands of people where genuine democracy is the reality and not a fantasy? For too long our minds have been chained by fear, by division, by impotence. The one thing the elite fear most is a great awakening. That day is here. Together we can seize it.",Recent $2M Jackpot Winner Leroy Fick Still Uses Equivalent of Food Stamps for Groceries; Some Aim to Disqualify Him,partially false

BYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Email * Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said. The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources. And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server. And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed. FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly. And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election. Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed. Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued. That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election. We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask. Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratory?,FALSE

Addressing those allegations, Moscow stated that it fully complied with its obligations under the agreement. The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and became one of the measures to build confidence in post-Cold War Europe. It has been operating since 2002 and allows participating countries to openly collect information on each other's military forces and activities.

The Russian side has repeatedly provided the United States with evidence that these weapons in no way violate the New START treaty. They do not want to accept this evidence.

f9d098d6,"It heralds a rare success in the reversal of environmental damage and shows that global action can make a difference. The ozone layer is continuing to heal and has the potential to fully recover, according to a new study. A scientific paper, published in Nature, heralds a rare success in the reversal of environmental damage and shows that orchestrated global action can make a difference. The ozone layer is a protective shield in the Earth’s stratosphere which absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation reaching us from the sun. Without the ozone layer it would be nearly impossible for anything to survive on the planet. In the past, human use of substances – chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) – caused such life-threatening damage to the ozone layer that in 1987, an international treaty called the “Montreal Protocol” was adopted to ban them. Antara Banerjee, a CIRES Visiting Fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder who also works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is lead author of the study. She told The Independent: “We found signs of climate changes in the southern hemisphere, specifically in the air circulation patterns. “The challenge was showing that these changing air circulation patterns were due to the shrinking ozone hole following the implementation of the Montreal Protocol. “The jet stream in the southern hemisphere was gradually shifting towards the south pole in the last decades of the 20th century due to ozone depletion. “Our study found that movement has stopped since 2000 and might even be reversing. The pause in movement began around the same time that the ozone hole started to recover. “The emissions of ozone-depleting substances that were responsible for the ozone hole - the CFCs from spray cans and refrigerants – started to decline around 2000, thanks to the Montreal Protocol.” She added: “It’s not just ozone that affects the jet stream – CO2 also has an effect. What we are seeing is that there is a ‘tug-of-war’ between ozone recovery, which pulls the jet stream one way (to the North), and rising CO2, which pulls the other way (to the South). “We are seeing the pause in the shifting jet stream because these two forces are currently in balance. That might change in the future when ozone has fully recovered and CO2 carries on pushing it south.”
The impacts of this “pause” in shifting wind patterns varies, meaning parts of the world will be affected differently. She said: “In Australia, for example, before 2000 in the ozone-depletion era, it was suggested that winters were drying because the jet stream was moving further south and taking rain-bearing storms away from that region. Those changes might now stabilise which could be good news for Australia. “For other regions like South America, ozone-depletion had caused an expansion of the tropics and led to more rainfall. Bands of agricultural production widened which was good for them but might now stabilise. That has implications for their economies and food security.” Overall, it is good news for the fight against climate change. She added: “The second most important point of the study, which I would say is a very good finding, is further evidence that the ozone hole is shrinking and that is thanks to the Montreal Protocol. “It shows that this international treaty has worked and we can reverse the damage that we’ve already done to our planet. That’s a lesson to us all that can hopefully be applied to our greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change. “If we keep adhering to this protocol then the ozone hole is projected to recover – at different times, in different parts of the atmosphere. In some regions, we think it might happen in the next couple of decades and in others much later in the century.”","UK exit from European Union on a knife edge, as poll shows British public are now 50/50 over leaving",partially false
8a2e3fdd,"By Guest Columnist MATTHEW CHARLES CARDINALE, CEO and news editor of Atlanta Progressive News As Atlanta’s City Council considers its next big moves on affordable housing and community development, decision-makers and stakeholders alike have the opportunity to benefit from a bold, cutting-edge policy tool: Affordable Housing Impact Statements. Much like an environmental impact statement or a fiscal impact statement, an Affordable Housing Impact Statement would specify the estimated impact of certain public policy decisions of the City Council on Atlanta’s affordable housing stock. The statement would be prepared by the Office of Housing and would look like this: ***** This legislation, if enacted, is estimated to have a projected impact upon the affordable housing stock of the City of Atlanta by: Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at 30 or below percent of the City of Atlanta Area Median Income (AMI); and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable between 30.01 and 50 percent of AMI; and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at between 50.01 and 80 percent of AMI; and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at over 80 percent of AMI. ****** The statements would be presented to Councilmembers before they vote on impacted legislation so that they are empowered with meaningful information about the consequences of their decisions as they’re making them. And the statements would be kept in a repository by the Municipal Clerk so that stakeholders can review the statements over time to see the trend of public policy and whether Atlanta is getting closer to, or further away, from, its goals. After my nearly 10 years of citizen advocacy before Atlanta’s Community Development/Human Resources Committee (CD/HR) on issues of affordable housing, I have become very familiar with the concerns of Councilmembers and the needs of Atlanta’s working families in connection with this issue. So, as a law student at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, currently in my third year, I took the idea of Affordable Housing Impact Statements – an idea of Ben Howard, senior advocate, that was adopted by Georgia Stand Up’s policy platform in 2009 – and drafted a proposed ordinance for the City of Atlanta, implementing the idea. Due to the leadership of Chairman Andre Dickens and Councilman Michael Julian Bond, the draft ordinance was introduced at CD/HR in November 2014, and is pending there as a held paper: Atlanta has an affordable housing crisis that is getting worse every year. The cost of rental housing is getting higher and higher, and it is making it burdensome, if not impossible, for working class people–including those who work in Atlanta – to live in Atlanta. Tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent, according to a recent report by HR&A Advisors and Enterprise, Inc., on behalf of the City of Atlanta. This includes more than 25,000 cost-burdened renter households subsisting on $20,000 or less per year; and about 13,000 cost-burdened renter households making between $20,000 and $34,999 per year. People tend to think of the availability or lack of affordable housing as a product of market forces only, but public policy also plays a huge role. For example, routine decisions by the Atlanta City Council include land-use decisions that result in the loss of affordable units and replacing them with market-rate units, for example when a developer submits a proposal that clearly presumes the demolition of existing affordable units, like the San Lucia apartments by the Lindbergh Target. Other routine decisions that affect the housing stock include the acceptance of federal grant dollars like Community Development Block Grants for the production or rehabilitation of affordable housing. These grants can help meet the greatest unmet needs among Atlanta’s working families, if the units are appropriately targeted at 30 percent AMI. Impact statements would document the positive impact in terms of numbers of units and the income brackets of the households who will benefit. There are also bigger proposals already introduced or in the works, including: mandatory inclusionary zoning; land banks and land trusts; policies to deal with abandoned, foreclosed properties; and more. That is why this is an ideal time to enact Affordable Housing Impact Statements now, rather than later. That way we can have a meaningful, consistent way to document positive or negative impacts across a range of income brackets, as we consider each of these diverse proposals. Late last year, I had the opportunity to meet with Terri Lee, deputy commissioner of Planning and Community Development; and Derrick Jordan, interim director of the Office of Housing, to discuss their thoughts and concerns, which they also expressed to the CD/HR Committee. Since then, I have drafted an administrative memo, providing additional guidance on how such an impact statement could be composed; and proposed amendments to reduce the administrative burden on the Office of Housing. Also, the Council increased the Office of Housing’s staff in the most recent fiscal year budget, which is already in effect, so preparing these Impact Statements would be a funded mandate. We have a lot of work to do in terms of substantive policy making; and I think mandatory inclusionary upzoning, with a component for units at 30 percent AMI, and appropriate unit bonuses for developers, will be critical. I just think adopting an Affordable Housing Impact Statement reporting policy is a common sense next step, a step that is focused on process, to make sure that we are collecting information in a pro-active and consistent way. It can help us monitor and gauge the potential impacts of policy decisions as we make them. I think adoption of this policy would show the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that Atlanta is serious about addressing structural barriers to fair housing in an affirmative way. It also will show the world we are serious about leading the way on this important issue. If you agree that Affordable Housing Impact Statements are a good idea, please contact members the Atlanta City Council’s CD/HR Committee, including Chairman Dickens as well as Councilmembers Bond, Kwanza Hall, Ivory Young, Cleta Winslow, Keisha Lance Bottoms, and Joyce Sheperd.",Energy Secretary Rick Perry says CO2 is not the main driver of climate change,TRUE
6b94e779,"Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan. Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state’s Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K.; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated. In California, suffering from its worst drought in a millennium, a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours, jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic. Then, a few days later, the region was pounded by intense, virtually unheard-of summer rains. Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean, shifting weather patterns worldwide. On July 20th, James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public’s attention in the summer of 1988, issued a bombshell: He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted: 10 feet by 2065. The authors included this chilling warning: If emissions aren’t cut, “We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.” Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen’s study, said their new research doesn’t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise, it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss, especially among world leaders. In particular, says Rignot, the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “safe” level of climate change — “would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise.” Hansen’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be. Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history, some parts of the ocean, near where ice is melting exceptionally fast, are actually cooling, slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy. Sure enough, a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland, exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown, “This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding.” Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures, the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound. Storms will get stronger, and sea-level rise will accelerate. Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come, though Mann said it was still “unclear” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon. And yet, these aren’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year. For that, you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves. Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life. Related: Apocalypse Soon: 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom Eighty-year-old Roger Thomas runs whale-watching trips out of San Francisco. On an excursion earlier this year, Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales. During a survey on July 4th, federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning. Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California, but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers. Why are they coming so close to shore? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water. The whales are having a heyday. “It’s unbelievable,” Thomas told a local paper. “Whales are all over the place.” Last fall, in northern Alaska, in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil, federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach. It was the largest-ever documented “haul out” of walruses, and a sign that sea ice, their favored habitat, is becoming harder and harder to find. Marine life is moving north, adapting in real time to the warming ocean. Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay, California, the farthest north that’s ever been known to occur. A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range. Across California, there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north, such as Mexican red crabs. No species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest, the salmon. Every two weeks, Bill Peterson, an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon, takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon. What he’s been seeing this year is deeply troubling. Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet. A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon, which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs. The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn’t exist without salmon. But their situation is precarious. This year, officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks, because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving. One species, the winter-run Chinook salmon, is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years, should the warm water persist offshore. “You talk to fishermen, and they all say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before,’ ” says Peterson. “So when you have no experience with something like this, it gets like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ “ Atmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century. Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years, during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO. It also makes big El Niños, like this year’s, more likely. The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven’t yet figured out precisely what’s behind them and why they happen when they do. It’s not a permanent change — the ocean’s temperature will likely drop from these record highs, at least temporarily, some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting, and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview. “The climate [change] models predict this gentle, slow increase in temperature,” says Peterson, “but the main problem we’ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high. As scientists, we can’t keep up with it, and neither can the animals.” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round: “At some point, you knock them down, and the fight is over.” Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean’s food chain. In July, another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “quite traumatic” impact on plankton diversity, with some species dying out while others flourish. As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it’s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines. According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT, that trend means “the whole food chain is going to be different.” The Hansen study may have gotten more attention, but the Dutkiewicz study, and others like it, could have even more dire implications for our future. The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes, actually, we’re heading toward the worst-case scenario. Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away, the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale. Jacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. She knows a lot about extinction, and her work is more relevant than ever. Essentially, she’s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren’t. The ancient data she studies shows “really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans. We’re talking less than a decade.” For the past year or two, a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “the blob” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii, Alaska and Baja California that’s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin. Amid warmer temperatures, plankton numbers have plummeted, and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle. Significant northward surges of warm water have happened before, even frequently. El Niño, for example, does this on a predictable basis. But what’s happening this year appears to be something new. Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years, which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck. A similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years. An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that’s persisted for most of the past 18 months. Daniel Swain, a Stanford University meteorologist, has called it the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” — weather patterns just aren’t supposed to last this long. What’s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems, the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years, or longer. The largest ocean on Earth, the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins. While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world’s oceans, it’s not alone: Globally, 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures, and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly, boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific. Six percent of the world’s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade, perhaps permanently, thanks to warming waters. Since warmer oceans expand in volume, it’s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise. One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents, perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland, that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years, from 2009 to 2010. To be sure, it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary, but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event, and it’s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “almost as significant as some hurricane events.” Possibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters. Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies: A striking study last year showed that, along the West Coast, the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving, with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem. One of the study’s authors, Nina Bednaršek, told Science magazine that the snails’ shells, pitted by the acidifying ocean, resembled “cauliflower” or “sandpaper.” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world’s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “effectively irreversible” change on ocean ecosystems during this century. In as little as a decade, the study suggested, chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world’s oceans. “I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct,” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013. “But this change we’re seeing is happening so fast it’s almost instantaneous.” Thanks to the pressure we’re putting on the planet’s ecosystem — warming, acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change. Here’s what could happen next. The combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff, abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen. The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate. So far, dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts, but in the 21st century, deep-ocean dead zones could become common. These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish, whales, pretty much everything upward. If this were to occur, large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies, pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich deeper water. Enhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours, perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests, and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas, further enhancing dead zones. In the past year, downpours have broken records in Long Island, Phoenix, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston and Pensacola, Florida. Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the “Great Dying,” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered “Great Dying” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start. With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. “Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today,” Moffitt said. As you might expect, having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists, and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy. Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece, virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point. For Simone Alin, an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, the changes she’s seeing hit close to home. The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world’s marine ecosystems. The local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse. Alin calls oysters, which are non-native, the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound: “A canary is also not native to a coal mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good indicator of change.” Though she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day, the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard: “This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes, then . . . everything could change, right?” Alin’s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day. But four years ago, the birth of her twins “heightened the whole issue,” she says. “I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea. Now, it just makes me feel crushed.” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, moved from Canada to Texas with her husband, a pastor, precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change. There, she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would. But she’s already planning her exit strategy: “If we continue on our current pathway, Canada will be home for us long term. But the majority of people don’t have an exit strategy. . . . So that’s who I’m here trying to help.” James Hansen, the dean of climate scientists, retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist. But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to, Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful. That’s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution: End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible. If tomorrow, the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong, coordinated carbon tax that’s also applied to imports, the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up. This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times, with tepid bipartisan support. Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot, for Hansen, even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it. On a conference call with reporters in July, Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris. One group Hansen is helping is Our Children’s Trust, a legal advocacy organization that’s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children, the group argues, are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet. A separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant (which, under the Clean Air Act, can dissipate on its own), it’s also a toxic substance. In general, these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment, cause an unreasonable risk, and therefore require remediation. In this case, remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground. Even if these novel challenges succeed, it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable. But maybe that’s enough. When all feels lost, saving a few species will feel like a triumph. Odds are good that the worst wildfire disaster in U.S. history might not happen in the West – but in New Jersey. Find out why.",,other
42b5592a,"Proctor, VT — According to NBC News, a pastor at the Christian Proctor Church in Vermont, has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. This comes shortly after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decisionruling that states must allow gay marriage. The Christian Pastor, 56-year-old Paul Horner, had his lawyer speak to reporters on his behalf. “We are currently disputing the guilty verdict and I am confident my client will be a free man here shortly,” said attorney Tom Downey. “Horner was just using his best judgement according to his rights and religious freedom in this country.” The Honorable Myron Danus handed down the harsh sentence. “Religious freedom goes both ways, Mr. Horner,” Danus told a packed courtroom. “It is not your place to deny individuals the same rights that everyone else has, rights that were passed down and agreed upon in a court of law, the ultimate court, the Supreme Court. It is not your decision whether or not you agree with the law but more importantly that you follow it and enforce it.” According to the criminal investigation, the Christian Proctor Church is registered with the state as a “religious corporation” limited to performing “one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.” But the church is also registered as a for-profit business and city officials said that means the owners must comply with state and federal regulations. Steve Shand president of the Vermont Family Research Committee, said it is “open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government’s redefinition of marriage.” “Homosexuals are gay,” Shand told reporters. “Why should Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs? It’s a slippery slope my friend. Pretty soon these same pastors will be forced to wed animals or kitchen appliances. This is not my America!” Gwen Hawkins who is president of the LGBT Pride Center in Vermont said she is happy with the guilty verdict. “We just want the same rights as everyone else and this guilty verdict sets a great precedent,” Hawkins said. “These fanatical Christians base their life on one verse in the Bible but they seem to forget the other 99% of the verses in the book. For example, why can’t we stone to death Bristol Palin for having a baby out of wedlock? And what about her mother, Sarah Palin, breaking the rules of Corinthians 14:34 which clearly state that as a woman, she is not allowed to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. But no, they like to pick the one verse in the Bible about gay people and build their camp around it.” Proctor is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States.

054fefab,"January 11, 2017 WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) today urged Senate Democrats to work with Republicans to repeal Obamacare and clear the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. A vote on legislation that provides Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare is expected in the Senate later today. “Democrats have failed to live up to nearly every promise they made when they forced Obamacare through Congress without a single Republican vote,” Blunt said. “Despite all of their claims to the contrary, this law has forced millions of Americans off the plans and doctors they liked and could afford, drastically driven up premiums and deductibles, and slashed the number of health plan options available to families.” This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent. Blunt continued, “Now is the time for Senate Democrats to start making things right. They’ll have that opportunity today when the Senate considers a resolution that gives Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare and pave the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care. By taking this first step toward repealing Obamacare, Republicans are keeping the promises we made to the American people. I urge all of my Democrat colleagues to do the same.”","SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 18A335 RICHARD BRAKEBILL, ET AL. v.

ad18dc46,"Friends, The North Carolina Republican Party was pleased yesterday when, in conjunction with the Wake County GOP, we were able to force the resignation of State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement Chairman - Democrat Andy Penry, one of Gov. Roy Cooper's handpicked hyper-partisans - for gross violations concerning the code of conduct for Board members, and whose inexcusable lack of transparency dealing with rumors about unproven voting irregularities in the 9th Congressional District. Here are some news/video clips from the NCGOP & Wake County GOP Press Conference on Saturday: WTVD, WRAL, WSOC To view the full press conference, go to the link below: WRAL Here are our thoughts on the 9th Congressional District: Our longstanding position is that every lawful vote should be counted. We are glad to see that Democrats in North Carolina are FINALLY concerned about integrity at the ballot box. They certainly haven’t been in the past and have spent almost a decade arguing against any effort to shore up our election system. We obviously support an investigation into allegations of irregularities fraud as long as it is fair and includes the investigations of irregularities committed by both sides. T he reality is that there aren’t enough ballots in question to change the outcome of this election. Certifying the race has nothing to do with punishing any lawbreakers. Certifying the race has nothing to do with punishing any lawbreakers. To date, there has been no evidence made public that any illegal conduct actually occurred. The Democrats’ affidavits published in media reports do not give any indication as to which side the actions described may have benefited, and based on Democrats’ alleged past actions in Bladen County, these activities could easily be attributed to Democrat efforts. Further, nothing indicates any amount of votes that would affect the outcome of this election. Board of Elections needs to immediately certify this race while continuing their investigation. That is the ONLY appropriate step for the voters of the Ninth District as we prepare to convene a new Congress. The State Board needs to be stop acting in secret. They’ve provided no information to the media or the public. They refuse to discuss this race in public, doing all their work in closed session. What are they hiding? Are they hiding they have no evidence to justify delaying certification and simply want leverage in negotiations over new election rules, or do they simply want to try and steal a GOP Congressional Seat won fair and square? By statute, election protests must be filed within 2 business days following the County canvass. There were no protests filed within that time frame. We are pleased by Friday’s court ruling in our favor, extending the current SBOE until Dec 12. It’s unfortunate that this step had to be taken by our candidate but the ruling shows that the Board will have to perform its duties and certify our election in an expedient manner. That’s exactly what the voters of this district deserve. Governor Cooper sued to have total control over the elections process; he won. He helped defeat the Bipartisan Board of Elections Amendment. He wanted total control of elections and currently has it. He is responsible for this horrific process and the lack of transparency. If this election is stolen, Roy Cooper will have stolen it. Should a special election in NC09 occur, we predict well over 200,000 people who cast legal ballots would be disenfranchised and their legal votes erased. Only a fraction of the nearly 290,000 people who voted in NC09 would be able to vote again. Any new election or long delay in certification would result in 750,000 citizens in NC09 not being represented in Congress for an extended period of time. This is unacceptable. As to the number of non-returned absentee mail ballots, a significant number of these people voted instead by casting a ballot in-person early absentee or Election Day. It’s not uncommon for that to happen, e.g. a person is able to make it to their polling place in lieu of casting an absentee ballot. This is also explained in part due to problems with local boards sending absentee ballots in a timely matter. This reduces the percentage of non-returned ballots in each county in some cases by 10%-20%. It is also very reasonable to assume that a number of these ballots simply went non-returned. This is not discounting any potential wrongdoing but the full story needs to be told. a significant number of these people voted instead by casting a ballot in-person early absentee or Election Day.

83ac5f2a,"Mike Bloomberg has been plunged into fresh controversy over his comments on race and transgender people, as scrutiny intensifies over the presidential candidate’s past remarks ahead of his Democratic debate debut. On Tuesday, a 2011 PBS interview resurfaced in which Bloomberg stated that there was an “enormous cohort of black and Latino males” who “don’t know how to behave in the workplace”. And separately, a newly uncovered video from March 2019 showed Bloomberg describing trans rights as being about “some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter”. The comments re-emerged as the multibillionaire media mogul faces questions over his other past remarks on race and women, and as he secured a presence in the televised Democratic debates for the first time. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published on Tuesday shows Bloomberg with 19% support among Democrats for the presidential nomination, enough to join the debate stage alongside other leading contenders in Las Vegas on Wednesday. In the PBS interview, Bloomberg, who was then mayor of New York City, said he supported a program to boost employment prospects for minorities and lamented that “blacks and Latinos score terribly in school testing compared to whites and Asians. If you look at our jails, it’s predominantly minorities.” Bloomberg said some progress had been made but “nevertheless, there’s this enormous cohort of black and Latino males, age, let’s say, 16 to 25, that don’t have jobs, don’t have any prospects, don’t know how to find jobs, don’t know what their skillsets are, don’t know how to behave in the workplace where they have to work collaboratively and collectively”. The former mayor added that crime in New York City takes place in “minority neighborhoods”, with victims and perpetrators of crime “virtually all minorities”. In a March 2019 video, first reported by BuzzFeed News, Bloomberg criticized Democrats for focusing on transgender rights, saying it was “not a winning formula for most people”. “If your conversation during a presidential election is about some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that’s not a winning formula for most people. They care about healthcare, they care about education, they care about safety, and all of those kinds of things.” The revelation comes on the same day Bloomberg’s campaign released a video touting the former New York mayor’s record on LGBTQ issues, BuzzFeed notes. Bloomberg has achieved solid polling numbers despite several previous interviews and comments coming to light that have been viewed as highly problematic. An audio clip of Bloomberg defending his “stop-and-frisk” approach to policing in New York from 2015 featured the former mayor attributing 95% of murders to “male minorities, 16 to 25”. He added: “You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops.” Bloomberg has previously apologized for the use of stop-and-frisk, saying it was “overused” in New York. His rivals for the Democratic nomination, in particular the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, have accused Bloomberg of being out of step with voters and guilty of attempting to buy the nomination via his vast wealth. Bloomberg will appear on stage in Wednesday’s debate in Las Vegas alongside former vice-president Joe Biden, Sanders, senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg. Fellow billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer is still hoping to qualify. The Democratic National Committee recently changed its rules for how a candidate qualifies for the debate, opening the door for Bloomberg to be on stage and drawing the ire of some candidates who dropped out of the race for failing to make prior stages. The candidates were previously required to receive a certain number of campaign contributions to qualify, but Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $60bn, is not taking donations. The primetime event will be a stark departure from Bloomberg’s highly choreographed campaign. He has poured more than $300m into television advertising, a way to define himself for voters without facing criticism. Bloomberg has barely crossed paths on the trail with his fellow Democrats. He decided to skip the first four voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in favor of focusing on the 14 states that vote on 3 March and the contests that come afterward. He rarely mentions his rivals by name, though his campaign is centered on the idea that none of them can beat Donald Trump.

People who are infected with this were diagnosed to have Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS). Experts said that this could also be transmitted from human to human. Based on previous cases, the transmission can hapoen from an infected animals or people through blood, respiratory tract and wounds.The expert who has been handling this cases said that the person who was infected three years ago, passed away and had affected 16 more people. Because of this, all the medical staffs and family members of the patient’s family must take an extra precaution about the infection. He also told everyone to avoid jungles and bushes. On the other hand, ticks don’t fly so it wouldn’t spread that fast. Actually, they rapidly breed in summer but there is still no medicine or vaccine for this. The expert is only considering this as an epidemic in the province of China where patients were diagnosed with this sickness.","A report in the British Medical Journal illustrates how a woman has beaten blood cancer with the help of turmeric. In 2007, 67-year-old Dieneke Ferguson was diagnosed with myeloma and she progressed to stage three within 15 months. Three failed rounds of chemotherapy and four failed stem cell transplants later, doctors told her she had very little hope. She told the U.K.’s Daily Mail: “I have been on all sorts of toxic drugs and the side-effects were terrifying.” She once lost her memory for three days, and two vertebrae in her spine collapsed and had to be injected with a type of concrete for stability. Four years after her initial diagnosis, she took matters into her own hands and started taking a daily dose of curcumin, the key component of turmeric. She took eight grams every evening on an empty stomach. Since then, her cancer has stabilized and her blood counts have returned to normal. She has also enjoyed a good quality of life. When she told her oncologist she was taking turmeric, she reports that he was very interested after seeing what a big difference it made. Myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer, and it begins in plasma cells in the bone marrow. When these cells become abnormal and begin to multiply, it becomes myeloma and causes severe pain, nerve damage, fatigue and bone damage. Treatment is generally geared toward controlling its symptoms because there is no cure, and people typically don’t live beyond five years of being diagnosed. The BMJ report says that Ferguson’s results suggest that turmeric could be used to help myeloma patients in the future, adding: “The fact that our patient, who had advanced stage disease and was effectively salvaged while exclusively on curcumin, suggests a potential antimyeloma effect of curcumin.” No other possible explanation for her recovery The report’s co-author, Jamie Cavenagh, said that there is no other possible explanation for her remarkable recovery beyond the curcumin. She continues to take the tablets to this day. The scientists are recommending further evaluation in clinical trials to pursue the possibility of using it as an official treatment. This could prove difficult, however, because doctors cannot prescribe it until it has been tested in wide-scale trials that cost millions. Natural compounds cannot be patented, so finding an investor would be extremely difficult. Turmeric benefits a wide range of ailments Turmeric is a perennial herb that contains the natural antioxidant polyphenol curcumin, which also has analgesic properties. It has been shown to inhibit the growth of myelomaand several other types of tumor cells. Some of the other illnesses that can benefit from curcumin include infections, dementia, depression and heart disease. A 2016 review in the Journal of Medicinal Food highlighted its potential for arthritis treatment, and doctors have also applauded its anti-inflammatory effects. A recent study found that it can help destroy neuroblastoma tumor cells, showing promise as a way to treat the most common type of cancer in infants. Another study is expected to be published soon showing its positive effects on bowel cancer. Although Ferguson said she took turmeric on an empty stomach, it is usually recommended that people take it with a fat or oil to help boost its absorption because it is a fat-soluble compound. Many people enjoy turmeric with yogurt or warm milk. In addition, studies have shown that taking it with black pepper boosts absorption significantly; many supplements also contain a small amount of black pepper for this reason. It’s wonderful to hear that people are successfully treating problems that doctors cannot conquer using nothing more than what nature has provided us. Not everyone will have the same success that Ferguson did, but the fact that natural solutions can help people turn around “hopeless” situations deserves further exploration, profit possibilities or not.",other
e8ac7372,"“Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017. In other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true. By “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that. Rather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown. What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact. That is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story. Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it. Büntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today Abrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era. Here’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries: And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it. The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda. Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing. Not that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.” Still, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too.

The proposed Trans-Pecos Pipeline (""TPP"")being developed by Energy Transfer Partners (""ETP"")would be the first natural gas pipeline project to cut thmugh parts ofthe 23 District, like the communities ofGreater Alpine and Greater Marfa,
on its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. This region, known as ""The Last Frontier"" is widely regarded as a Texas treasure —home to the McDonald Observatory, Big Bend National Park and numerous State Parks. I understand the importance ofinfrastructure projects to our energy security, but also recognize the need for federal agencies to fulfill their regulatory obligations in an efficient, thorough and thoughtful manner. As you are aware, ETP has petitioned FERC for a Presidential Permit to import and export natural gas across the U.S.-Mexico border near the City of Presidio. Before issuing a Presidential Permit, FERC has an obligation to determine that the proposal is in the public interest. Given serious concerns about thc proposed Pipeline that have been raised by my constituents, I believe it is appropriate and necessary for FERC to thoroughly review ETP's assertion that the proposed
Pipeline is in the public interest before making its final determination. To help address the legitimate and thoughtful concerns presented by my constituents, I submitted a series of questions to ETP about the extent to which ETP intended to take health, safety and environmental factors into account as they determined the TPP route. In reply, I received cursory responses and I am concerned that my constituents are not being treated in an open, transparent and respectful manner. Please assist my constituents by answering the following questions: 1. ETp claims that the Tpp should bc classifie as an ""intrastate"" pipeline subject to regulation by the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC). It is my understanding that there is significant controversy over whether the joining ofinterstate and intrastate pipelines falls gAz ~ 00I'f~ 20150702-0014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/19/2015 under state or federal jurisdiction. ETP confirmed in its Presidential Permit application that the proposed Pipeline will carry some gas not sourced from Texas. Since the Waha hub connects both types of pipelines, I am interested in any clarity FERC can provide regarding how ""intrastate"" and ""interstate"" natural gas pipeline determinations are made. I request that FERC take a close look at assigning the proper classification to the proposed Pipeline. 2. In 2013, the U.S. Government Accountability Office warned that the public may face great difficulty if pipeline developers utilize processes that ""are not transparent"" or if the public is denied adequate information ""about pipelines until after they have been approved."" Does FFNC agree with that assessment? Ifa pipeline developer fails to act in a transparent and open way with the public, is that developer departing I'rom the nouns
FERC expects? Does a lack oftransparency make it more diAicult for FERC to assess public interest? The oil and gas industry is of critical importance to Texas, and building and properly maintaining the infrastructure that supports this industry is paramount. However, infrastructure projects must
appropriately address the questions and concerns of affected communities and stakeholders. FERC should ensure the process surrounding consideration ofthe proposed Pipeline is open and fair before making a determination about whether the proposed project furthers the public interest.

d5f5108b,"A prominent member of the British parliament, Mr. Andrew Rosindell (pictured), has questioned the UK foreign secretary, Mr. William Hague, on the country’s engagement with Nigeria’s leading opposition party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), over the Boko Haram menace. Advertisement This came after a debate in parliament in which Labour MP Sandra Osborne sought to examine allegations of links between APC and the insurgents. The increasing questioning of the UK government by MPs on the issue may force an enquiry into the allegations. However, APC spokesman, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told TheCable on Friday that he was not aware of any meeting between the leadership of APC and Hague. Advertisement Rosindell, a conservative who represents Romford and is a member of the influential foreign affairs committee, sent in his written questions ─ called “notices” ─ on Tuesday, July 8. Hague is mandated to formally respond to Rosindell’s questions in the coming weeks on behalf of the British government. The questions, listed under “notices for written answer”, were published on the website of the UK parliament. Advertisement Rosindell’s queries relating to Boko Haram, as listed, are: To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, if he will commission an inquiry into the international support network for Boko Haram in Nigeria and Cameroon; and if he will make a statement. (Notice no. 204402) To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what discussions (a) he and (b) other Ministers in his Department have had with leading members of the Nigerian opposition party, the All Progressive Congress; and if he will make a statement. (204401) To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what assessment he has made of the rise in Islamic terrorism in Nigeria. (204387) To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what support his Department plans to offer to Nigeria in tackling the threat of Boko Haram. (204388) To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, what assessment he has made of links between Boko Haram and other Islamic extremist groups in Africa. (204389) To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, if he will discuss with his counterpart in Cameroon the need for constructive dialogue between that country and Nigeria in tackling Boko Haram; and if he will make a statement. (204390) Also at a recent meeting in parliament, led by Henry Jackson Society and chaired by an MP, John Glen, who is a close adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, similar allegations were raised that key APC members are supporters and financiers of Boko Haram “for ideological and political means”. The UK is now showing more than a passing interest in the Boko Haram threat after the kidnap of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok, Borno State, in April. Advertisement Hague, at an international summit on rape in warzones held in London in June, reaffirmed the UK’s “strong and united commitment to defeat Boko Haram [and] to end the scourge of terrorism in Nigeria”. President Goodluck Jonathan recently launched the Safe School Initiative with the support of the British government. Although Jonathan has not directly accused APC of having links with Boko Haram, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to which he belongs has constantly tied the opposition to the insurgents. Recently, an APC member, Mr. Femi Fani-Kayode, defected to the PDP, accusing some top members of the opposition party of having sympathy for Boko Haram.

37766490,"PM to set out his vision for a “truly twenty-first century” prison system, while calling for prison reform to be one of the “great progressive causes” of British politics Six new ‘reform prisons’ to be created this year, with full autonomy over how they operate and spend their budget Prison education system will also be completely transformed with full control being given to ‘reform prison’ governors, while protecting the £130m per year budget The Prime Minister is expected to slam the ‘scandalous failure’ of the prisons sector later today as he outlines his vision for a modern, more effective, truly twenty-first century prison system. Giving the first speech purely focused on prisons by a British PM in more than 2 decades, he will outline plans to give prison governors complete control over the way they run their prisons, which will empower staff, drive up standards and cut reoffending. He will promise 6 of these new ‘reform prisons’ by the end of the year and through a new Prisons Bill in the next session, has vowed to unleash these principles across the prisons system. The Prime Minister is expected to say: It can be easy for us all – when prisons are closed off by high walls and barbed wire – to adopt an “out of sight, out of mind” attitude. I want this government to be different. When I say we will tackle our deepest social problems and extend life chances, I want there to be no no-go areas. And that includes the 121 prisons in our country, where our social problems are most acute and people’s life chances are most absent. So I want to explain why I believe prison reform should be a great progressive cause in British politics and to set out my vision for a modern, more effective, truly twenty-first century prison system. My starting point is this: we need prisons. Some people – including, of course, rapists, murderers, child abusers, gang leaders – belong in them. For me, punishment – that deprivation of liberty – is not a dirty word. I never want us to forget that it is the victims of crime who should always be our principal priority. And I am not unrealistic or starry-eyed about what prisons can achieve. Not everyone shows remorse and not everyone seeks redemption. But I also strongly believe that we must offer chances to change; that for those trying hard to turn themselves around, we should offer hope; that in a compassionate country, we should help those who’ve made mistakes to find their way back onto the right path. In short: we need a prison system that doesn’t see prisoners as simply liabilities to be managed, but instead as potential assets to be harnessed. But the failure of our system today is scandalous. 46% of all prisoners will re-offend within a year of release. 60% of short-sentenced prisoners will reoffend within the same period. And current levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm should shame us all. In a typical week, there will be almost 600 incidents of self-harm; at least one suicide; and 350 assaults, including 90 on staff. This failure really matters. It matters to the public purse: this cycle of reoffending costs up to £13 billion a year. It matters to you: because in the end, who are the victims of this re-offending? It’s the mother who gets burgled or the young boy who gets mugged. It matters to the prison staff – some of the most deeply committed public servants in our country – who have to work in dangerous and intimidating conditions. And yes, it matters to the prisoners themselves, who mustn’t feel like society has totally given up on them. I’m clear: we need wholesale reform. And I am convinced that with the right agenda, we can be world leaders in change just like we have been in welfare, just like in education we can demonstrate that with the right reforms, we can make a lasting difference to people in our society. The PM will also announce a drive to make our prisons more transparent in terms of how they operate, by developing proper data and meaningful metrics so we can easily compare prison performance. This could include measuring individual institutions’ reoffending levels, employment outcomes after release, place of residence following release and progress made on basic literacy and key skills. Alongside this, the PM will also confirm that the government will soon be publishing Dame Sally Coates’ review of prison education, where she will recommend the end to regional contracts and instead advises giving much greater control of education to prison governors. The recommendation, which has been accepted in full by the government, will be backed further by the government promising to protect prison education budgets in cash terms, with £130 million per year. And David Laws has agreed to chair a new social enterprise and work with Dame Sally Coates and organisations such as Teach First to develop a new scheme that will recruit high quality graduates who will transform prisons into places of rehabilitation and learning. David Laws said: I am a firm believer in the power of education and have seen first-hand the difference great teachers can make. I look forward to working with Dame Sally Coates to establish a graduate scheme that will help to support our vision of placing high quality education at the heart of the prison regime. Brett Wigdortz OBE, Founder & CEO of Teach First said: Over the last 13 years Teach First has, with our school and university partners, developed expertise in attracting and mobilising talented leaders to support and inspire the least advantaged in society. Like so many, we know that too often there is a link between low achievement at school and the prison population. I am therefore delighted to be able to share our knowledge of attracting talented individuals to key professions that transform the lives of those facing the greatest barriers.

8fc3a3a1,"The application to vacate the stay entered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on September 24, 2018, presented to JUSTICE GORSUCH and by him referred to the Court, is denied. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH took no part in the consideration or decision of this application.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins, dissenting from denial of the application to vacate stay. I would grant the application to vacate the Eighth Circuit’s stay because last-minute “[c]ourt orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4–5 (2006) (per curiam). The risk of voter confusion appears severe here because the injunction against requiring residential-address identification was in force during the primary election and because the Secretary of State’s website announced for months the ID requirements as they existed under that injunction. Reasonable voters may well assume that the IDs allowing them to vote in the primary election would remain valid in the general election. If the Eighth Circuit’s stay is not vacated, the
risk of disfranchisement is large. The Eighth Circuit observed that voters have a month to “adapt” to the new regime. But that observation overlooks specific factfindings by the District Court: (1) 70,000 North Dakota resi- 2 BRAKEBILL v. JAEGER GINSBURG, J., dissenting dents—almost 20% of the turnout in a regular quadrennial election—lack a qualifying ID; and (2) approximately 18,000 North Dakota residents also lack supplemental
documentation sufficient to permit them to vote without a qualifying ID. Although the unchallenged portion of the injunction permitting the use of more informal supplemental documents somewhat lessens this concern, that relief, by itself, scarcely cures the problem given the all too real risk of grand-scale voter confusion. True, an order by this Court vacating the stay would be yet another decision that disrupts the status quo as the election draws ever closer. But the confusion arising from vacating the stay would at most lead to voters securing an additional form of ID. That inconvenience pales in comparison to the confusion caused by the Eighth Circuit’s order, which may lead to voters finding out at the polling place that they cannot vote because their formerly valid ID is now insufficient.","Migrants DEMAND $50,000 Each to go Home, Or Else…",TRUE
a8efb35c,"Parents living in some parts of the country are 50 times more likely to have their term-time holidays approved than those in others, statistics show. Government figures reveal a postcode lottery in terms of a family's chances of taking their child out of classes without being fined. Torbay in Devon is the best place to live if you want to take secondary school children away during the term, with 51 per cent of all term time holidays given official approval. For primary age children, North Yorkshire gets the best deal – with 51 per cent of holidays given the green light there. The worst place for granting trips to secondary age children is Redbridge in London, where less than 1 per cent are granted, while for primary age it is Southampton, where 3 per cent are granted. For primary age children, North Yorkshire gets the best deal – with 51 per cent of holidays given the green light there file photo of primary school children above The data suggests a wide disparity in how schools and councils have been interpreting government rules which ban parents from taking their children out of school for holidays. A separate investigation for the BBC yesterday showed that 35 councils have changed their stance on term time fines since the case of Isle of Wight father Jon Platt. He overturned his fine in the High Court after arguing that his children had otherwise excellent attendance. Of 108 councils where data was available, 35 have altered their stance on the fines – with 28 no longer issuing them altogether. A further five councils are currently reviewing the policy. Term-time holiday campaigner David Hedley said: 'There is very little clarity on what is allowed. 'So many people struggle to get time off during the school holidays – especially those who work shift work in public services. 'It's not fair to continue to impose these very strict rules, the circumstances of the family should be taken into account. 'Families across the country are being penalised and it is ridiculous.' The figures for 2014-15 reveal the local authorities where the largest percentage of holidays were approved also include Shropshire and Herefordshire for both secondary and primary age children. Meanwhile, only a small percentage of holidays were approved for older children in Bracknell Forest, Leicester and Barnsley or for younger children in Luton, Rochdale and Bexley, London. Going on holiday outside of peak season can knock thousands off the price for a family, as travel companies force people to pay a premium during the school break. However, taking children on holiday during the term time has been banned since 2013 following new guidelines introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove. It has meant flouting parents have been slapped with fines of £60 per child, and many have been taken to court when they have refused to pay. The 2014-15 statistics appear to show many head teachers have been ignoring the rules and allowing parents to take their children away anyway. And this trend sped up in May 2016, when Isle of Wight father Jon Platt overturned his fine in the High Court, arguing that taking children away was legal as long as their overall attendance was excellent across the year. Councils and head teachers are now reluctant to enforce the ban because they know magistrates' courts will be unable to uphold the fines following the landmark case. The 2014-15 statistics from school registers also showed a record number of parents taking their children out of classes for holidays without approval of the head teacher. A total of 3.2million school days were lost – compared with just 2.6million two years previously. Over the same time period the number of days of authorised holiday had fallen from 4.1million to just under 900,000. The Department for Education is supporting an appeal by Mr Platt's council against the High Court's decision, and the case will go before the Supreme Court later this year. A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'Children should not be taken out of school without good reason. 'The evidence shows every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chances of achieving good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their future, vindicating our strong stance on attendance. 'Local authorities and schools are taking tough action on addressing absence, as has been seen in the downward trend in overall absence figures in recent years.' A spokesman for Redbridge Council said: 'We are very proud of our high performing schools and students. Our most recent GCSE results were excellent. 'One of the reasons our students are able to achieve such results is because they attend school regularly and we discourage holidays during term time so that that are taken only when absolutely necessary.' Darren Paffey, cabinet member for education at Southampton Council, said: 'We want all children in Southampton to get a good education and the first step to achieving this is ensuring excellent school attendance.

2aac10a5,"After three decades on the bench, Sarah Parker soon will find herself in an unfamiliar role: No cases to hear, no opinions to write, no court system to run.
This week Parker, chief justice of North Carolina’s Supreme Court for eight years, steps down after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 72 Saturday.
“There may be something to be said for statutory senility,” she says. A former Charlotte lawyer, Parker will leave with a reputation as a respected if unassuming jurist who guided the court through choppy waters with a steady hand and even temperament.
“Sarah is a quintessential professional,” says Republican Bob Orr, a former associate justice. “She has a sense of the history and tradition of the court as well as the system. She’s been a good chief justice in difficult times.” Gov. Pat McCrory named Associate Justice Mark Martin, 51, to succeed her. Martin is running against Ola Mae Lewis, a Superior Court judge from Brunswick County. Both are Republicans, though the November race is nonpartisan.
Parker, a Democrat, is stepping down after 21 years on the high court, where she heard 2,397 cases and wrote 153 opinions. In many ways it was a pioneering career.
She was one of a handful of women in law school. When she joined a Charlotte firm in 1969, she was the first woman in its century-old history. And for much of her judicial tenure, she was the only woman on either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.
The winner of November’s contest will inherit what Parker leaves behind: a court system hit hard by budget cuts and one increasingly buffeted by partisan politics.
Budget cuts strain operations The General Assembly’s final budget included $3.5 million in cuts to state courts, which the chief justice oversees. This hits a system that already has lost over 600 positions.
“This level of cut places a real strain on court operations and will require some difficult decisions to achieve,” Parker says. “We’re down really to bare bones.”
Budget pressures were a big part of Parker’s speech this summer to the North Carolina Bar Association in Wilmington. But Parker also spoke about a different kind of pressure.
Her speech came weeks after a group called Justice For All NC, funded by the Republican State Leadership Committee, spent $899,000 on TV ads against Justice Robin Hudson who, like all judges, runs in nonpartisan races.
In 2012, outside groups spent $2.3 million to re-elect incumbent Justice Paul Newby, far more than the $300,000 in outside money behind his opponent, Sam Ervin IV. “(I)f people perceive that our courts are for sale, they will lose confidence in the ability of courts to be fair and impartial,” she told the bar. “…We must have judges committed to the rule of law … without regard to politics, special interests or personal agenda.”
Former Chief Justice James Exum called it “one of her finest hours.” “She was keen to call the attention of lawyers to the ever-increasing politicization of our judiciary,” he says, “and how concerned she was and they should be.”
Parker says public financing for nonpartisan judicial races helped relieve the pressure of reliance on outside money. Last year the General Assembly ended public financing.
“The danger is people will begin to believe that seats on the high court are for sale to the highest bidder,” says Bob Hall, director of Democracy North Carolina and advocate of public financing. “And, unfortunately, some wealthy special interests seem happy to see that happen.” From Garinger to high court Orr once called Parker “one of the more conservative justices that has been on the court in a good long while.” But she has generally avoided partisan politics.
“I’ve never heard a bad word about her … because she’s been very professional … and just trying to keep the court out of politics and just doing its job,” says Michael Gerhardt, who teaches at the University of North Carolina law school. “Sometimes people want to draw the court into political conflicts.” A Charlotte native, Parker was in Garinger High’s first graduating class in 1960. After two years at Raleigh’s Meredith College, she transferred to UNC Chapel Hill, a school women generally could not attend until their junior year.
After graduation she joined the Peace Corps and spent two years teaching English in Ankara, Turkey. It was there she firmed up her decision to go into law. She returned to Chapel Hill for law school. Gov. Jim Hunt appointed her to the Court of Appeals in 1984. She was first elected to the Supreme Court in 1992 (“the first Garinger graduate to become a member of the Supreme Court,” she once joked).
Now Parker is looking forward to travel and free time. She’s not sure whether she’ll return to her Eastover home in Charlotte or move permanently to Raleigh.
“There’s a touch of sadness as you leave because of the association with my colleagues on the court,” she says. “The one thing that’s reassuring is you know the institution is larger than any of us.…
“It’s been a great journey. I’ve enjoyed it. It’s been rewarding and satisfying and I’m deeply grateful to the people of North Carolina for giving me the honor of being the chief justice. I still pinch myself to believe it’s real.”",Sarah Parker leaves legacy on Supreme Court,TRUE
a79dcc18,"Image captured by drone of fire damage near Graham, Washington A Level 3 evacuation was announced for this area of Bonney Lake a few days ago. Fire suppression efforts are still ongoing **Updated to include photo of SR 167 arsonist, and additional articles on this topic – see end of article**Read the article – Obviously not all fires are arson. Not all arsonists are part of the Antifa gang (although a distressingly large number of them seem to like burning things down). Recently, there have been a rash of rural brush fires in Washington State, including some significant fires in the Bonney Lake area, forcing mass evacuations in the local neighborhoods and rural communities in that area. The volume of these fires is not typical for Western Washington. Unlike California and Eastern Washington, Western Washington tends to be blessed with ample rain, lower average temperatures, fewer lightning strikes (see map here), and fewer widespread forest fires which tend to be more common in arid parts of the Western United States. However, it appears that a distressing number of these fires are not accidents, and willful arson is the cause. Who are these arsonists, and is it an organized effort? Plenty of damage has already been inflicted by rural brush fires in Pierce County, Washington. Mr. Jeffrey Acord, arrested for the SR 167 arson For example, earlier on Thursday, September 10th, the State Patrol arrested a Puyallup man who had started a fire along State Route 167 at North Meridian. Apparently, according to this story, this genius was livestreaming on Facebook the fire he had just started, and apparently he had been reported earlier in the day walking along the highway with a lighter. Ok, there are weirdos out there, and there always have been, so one firebug doesn’t mean we have a rash of arsonists patrolling rural areas (although some law enforcement sources are warning about coordinated attacks as reported here). However, according to one report (linked here), it looks like this guy was associated with Antifa (see here as well). He might already be out on a $1,000 bail (although some are reporting this is from an earlier arrest, and he was also arrested for another crime and is currently detained by Pierce County). He may not be alone in his pursuit of the “mostly peaceful” revolution, which seems obsessed with arson as a “mostly peaceful” tactic of their movement. Now a recent report, from the Graham area in Pierce County where a local rural resident captured on his surveillance camera, a vehicle driving by his field, stopping the car, a fire starting in the field, and then the car driving off. Fortunately, the fire died out before it could cause any serious damage, but that really looks like arson. There are also reports to watch out for homemade time delay arson devices (which look pretty questionable, crude and marginal to me). The alibi benefit for those who set them (assuming this is true) is even if they are caught they will just claim they were littering rather than trying to burn the area up. While fire investigations tend to take a back seat to suppressing the fires, and there are a lot of random fires throughout southwest rural Washington right now, this raises some questions. Just how many of these fires are being started willfully? For those paying attention (which admittedly, excludes most of the corporate media), we’ve been watching nightly attacks on buildings in urban centers in both Seattle and Portland where “mostly peaceful” arson is being committed repeatedly using Molotov cocktails and other devices as our friendly BLM/Antifa hone their arsonist skillsets. Just another night of mug shots from “mostly peaceful” Portland protestors arrested for arson, assault, and other peaceful activities…why wouldn’t they burn rural Washington for the “Revolution?” Antifa likes to play with fireworks, but who knows? Looking at who these folk actually are when they actually get arrested (see here), does anyone really believe they wouldn’t start rural fires just for fun, practice, and the joy of burning up rural Washington? If these types of “mostly peaceful” Antifa types believe it is smart and revolutionary to burn cars, buildings, and toss Molotov cocktails in our cities, why wouldn’t they try burning down rural Washington (and Oregon)? They probably believe it would be easy to get away with the crime, and other than the recent idiot arrested by the State Patrol yesterday, most of them probably can do this with far less chance of arrest than in downtown Seattle or Portland. What can you do about it? Rural residents of Western Washington tend not to worry about outdoor fires that much because they are not so common. However, forest and brush fires can become conflagrations if the conditions are right (and they are dangerous right now for a few more weeks). Some common sense things you should do on your property (and help your neighbors as well): Clean up flammable debris on your property – branches, etc. At least get them a distance away from your buildings Mow your fields. Tall, dead grass and weeds are perfect tinder. Make it harder for a fire to gain purchase. That might include mowing the right of way along the county roads next to your property Water your landscape around your home. I watched several brush fires spread and stop when they hit the well-watered and green landscape around homes a few years back in Rochester. This won’t always happen, but it can help make a more defensible space around your home. Pay attention to shady people driving around your community, get their license plates and vehicle descriptions and if you see them attempting to start fires, make sure you report this to the police. Stay in touch with your neighbors and compare notes. Surveillance cameras and rural game cameras are a good idea. Longer term, when the weather is back to its usual wet self in the fall and winter – take advantage of that time to limb those trees higher, clean up those weeds, brush, and try to plan for less fuel in your immediate area. If you have pastures that can be grazed by livestock, try to keep it grazed or mowed. Metal roofs and other construction plans can reduce some fire hazard. Rural forest fires are a hazard by themselves, and between accidents and lightning, they can happen. However, it could get far worse than normal when there are people running around for whatever deranged cause they support who also believe that burning your home and property will help with their Revolution or their “wokeness” or whatever. These are strange days. The Left might call it the “Poetry of Arson,” but for those who suffer the consequences, there is nothing poetic about the fire they inflict on us.

c9656175,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Tuesday that Democrats are living in a ""fantasy world"" when it comes to their climate change rhetoric and accused them of twisting the truth to help bolster their political talking points. Perry was responding on ""America's Newsroom"" to 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said climate change was a bigger threat to national security than ISIS or Al Qaeda while campaigning in Iowa on Sunday. ""I think they live in a fantasy world. The reality is that the United States is lowering emissions -- one of the only countries in the world,"" the former Texas governor said. ""I think about all the 194 [countries] that signed onto the Paris accord, the U.S. is the one that's leading the world in reducing emissions... America [is] transitioning away from old inefficient power plants to natural gas plants."" Perry added, ""Maybe they think, they being the Democrats that are running for president, that China would be a better place for all of this manufacturing to occur.

""We are addressing it. I think that's one of the things that the... media needs to take a second look at, what's going on. I'm leaving here from Pittsburgh headed to... our national energy technology lab, where we're seeing that type of technology being developed to reduce emissions -- to come up with the technologies and innovation,"" he said. ""Fifteen years ago people told us that we'd found all the oil and gas that there was. There was no more. Innovation changed that -- whether it's hydraulic fracturing, directional drilling. And now natural gas is replacing a lot of those old inefficient plants and we're driving down emissions.

I don't think the American people are going to be fooled by that rhetoric."" Perry spoke ahead of his visit with President Trump to Shell’s soon-to-be-completed Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, which critics have said will be a major air polluter.

96b47cba,"White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday repeatedly deflected reporters’ questions about gun control, saying “there will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that’s not the place that we’re in at this moment.” During the same media briefing, however, Sanders weighed in on the exact “policy discussion” that she said the White House would not engage in on “a day of mourning.” “I think one of the things that we don’t want to do is try to create laws that won’t create — or stop these types of things from happening,” Sanders said. “I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there. So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact.” This is the White House not talking about gun control. Here’s how frustrated Democrats have responded to Las Vegas As fact checkers have consistently pointed out, the claim that Chicago has “the strictest gun laws in the country” — one that Trump himself used in a presidential debate last fall — is outdated and has not been true since 2013. It is true, however, that the city’s gun-control regulations remain among the strictest in the nation, yet there were 4,368 shooting victims in Chicago last year, and there have been 2,877 this year. Later, Sanders responded to Hillary Clinton’s suggestion that a House bill that would ease restrictions on gun silencers could make attacks like the one Stephen Paddock carried out in Las Vegas even more deadly by dampening an audible cue that alerts potential targets. “I haven’t spoken with the president about that specific issue, but I don’t think that that is something that would have changed” the outcome, Sanders said. (An expert The Washington Post’s Philip Bump consulted suggests Sanders is probably right on this point.) “Again, I think before we start trying to talk about the preventions of what took place last night we need to know more facts,” Sanders continued. “And right now, we’re simply not at that point. It’s very easy for Mrs. Clinton to criticize and to come out, but I think we need to remember the only person with blood on their hands is that of the shooter.” During the briefing, NBC’s Hallie Jackson noted that “after the Orlando shooting, the president that day was out on Twitter talking about policy; he was talking about his travel ban.” Jackson was right: It is hard for the White House to say the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting is not the time to talk about policy because of the precedent set by Trump. Apparently it also is hard for Trump’s team to resist talking about policy, even when it insists that “today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost.” There is nothing inherently wrong with Sanders stating the president’s positions on gun control. Democrats are certainly declaring their own.

80ce6667,"Global Hot Air: Here's a United Nations climate report that environmentalists probably don't want anybody to read. It says that even if every country abides by the grand promises they made last year in Paris to reduce greenhouse gases, the planet would still be ""doomed."" X When President Obama hitched America to the Paris accords in 2016, he declared that it was ""the moment that we finally decided to save our planet."" And when Trump pulled out of the deal this year, he was berated by legions of environmentalists for killing it. But it turns out that the Paris accord was little more than a sham that will do nothing to ""save the planet."" According to the latest annual UN report on the ""emissions gap,"" the Paris agreement will provide only a third of the cuts in greenhouse gas that environmentalists claim is needed to prevent catastrophic warming. If every country involved in those accords abides by their pledges between now and 2030 — which is a dubious proposition — temperatures will still rise by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. The goal of the Paris agreement was to keep the global temperature increase to under 2 degrees. Eric Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment Program, which produces the annual report, said this week that ""One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future. Governments, the private sector and civil society must bridge this catastrophic climate gap."" The report says unless global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020, the CO2 levels will be way above the goal set for 2030, which, it goes on, will make it ""extremely unlikely that the goal of holding global warming to well below 2 degrees C can still be reached."" Not to worry. The UN claims that closing this gap will be easy enough, if nations set their collective minds to it. But this is a fantasy. The list of what would need to be done by 2020 — a little over two years from now — includes: Boosting renewable energy's share to 30%. Pushing electric cars to 15% of new car sales, up from less than 1% today. Doubling mass transit use. Cutting air travel CO2 emissions by 20%. And coming up with $1 trillion for ""climate action."" Oh, and coal-fired power plants would have to be phased out worldwide, starting now. According to the report, ""phasing out coal consumption … is an indispensable condition for achieving international climate change targets."" That means putting a halt to any new coal plants while starting to phase out the ones currently in use. Good luck with that. There are currently 273 gigawatts of coal capacity under construction around the world, and another 570 gigawatts in the pipeline, the UN says. That would represent a 42% increase in global energy production from coal. Does anyone really think developing countries who need coal as a cheap source of fuel to grow their economies will suddenly call it quits? So, does this mean the planet is doomed? Hardly. As we have noted in this space many times, all those forecasts of global catastrophe are based on computer models that have been unreliable predictors of warming. And all of the horror stories assume the worst. What the report does make clear, however, is that all the posturing by government leaders in Paris was just that. Posturing. None of these countries intended to take the drastic and economically catastrophic steps environmentalist claim are needed to prevent a climate change doomsday. As such, Trump was right to stop pretending. Whether you believe in climate change or not, the Paris climate accord amounted to nothing, or pretty close to it. Even the UN admits that now.

7d5ccffa,"Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record. The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end. The fall, revealed by Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere, has been caused by the end of El Nino – the warming of surface waters in a vast area of the Pacific west of Central America. Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record Some scientists, including Dr Gavin Schmidt, head of Nasa’s climate division, have claimed that the recent highs were mainly the result of long-term global warming. Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino, a complex natural phenomenon that takes place every few years, and has nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions by humans. The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right. Big El Ninos always have an immense impact on world weather, triggering higher than normal temperatures over huge swathes of the world. The 2015-16 El Nino was probably the strongest since accurate measurements began, with the water up to 3C warmer than usual. It has now been replaced by a La Nina event – when the water in the same Pacific region turns colder than normal. Last week, Mr Trump’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa’s $1.9 billion (about £1.4 billion) climate research budget This also has worldwide impacts, driving temperatures down rather than up. The satellite measurements over land respond quickly to El Nino and La Nina. Temperatures over the sea are also falling, but not as fast, because the sea retains heat for longer. This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year. But it is almost certain that next year, large falls will also be measured over the oceans, and by weather station thermometers on the surface of the planet – exactly as happened after the end of the last very strong El Nino in 1998. If so, some experts will be forced to eat their words. Last year, Dr Schmidt said 2015 would have been a record hot year even without El Nino. ‘The reason why this is such a warm record year is because of the long-term underlying trend, the cumulative effect of the long-term warming trend of our Earth,’ he said. This was ‘mainly caused’ by the emission of greenhouse gases by humans. Dr Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos. But on its website home page yesterday, Nasa featured a new study which said there was a hiatus in global warming before the recent El Nino, and discussed why this was so. Last night Dr Schmidt had not returned a request for comment. However, both his own position, and his Nasa division, may be in jeopardy. US President-elect Donald Trump is an avowed climate change sceptic, who once claimed it was a hoax invented by China. Last week, Mr Trump’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa’s $1.9 billion (about £1.4 billion) climate research budget. The Pacific warming can trigger floods, such as those in Peru, pictured above Other experts have also disputed Dr Schmidt’s claims. Professor Judith Curry, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said yesterday: ‘I disagree with Gavin. The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’ The slowdown in warming was, she added, real, and all the evidence suggested that since 1998, the rate of global warming has been much slower than predicted by computer models – about 1C per century. David Whitehouse, a scientist who works with Lord Lawson’s sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the massive fall in temperatures following the end of El Nino meant the warming hiatus or slowdown may be coming back. ‘According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino.",Hawking says Trump's climate stance could damage Earth,partially false
46479a5c,"A West Michigan woman says she raised more than $11,000 this past weekend to afford a heart transplant after Spectrum Health rejected her from its transplant list. 60-year-old Hedda Martin says Spectrum Health sent her a letter last week recommending she fundraise $10,000 for immunosuppressive drugs. Martin’s son started a GoFundMe campaign, and the campaign went viral after newly elected Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York tweeted about it over the holiday weekend. According to a Facebook post from Martin that has since been removed, she has raised enough money for the surgery. “I was given a challenge and I met it, so now there should be no reason to keep me off of the heart transplant list,” Martin wrote. Spectrum Health sent this statement to Michigan Radio: While we do not comment on specific patient situations to protect their privacy, Spectrum Health cares deeply about every patient that enters its doors and provides each of them the highest quality of care possible. While it is always upsetting when we cannot provide a transplant, we have an obligation to ensure that transplants are successful and that donor organs will remain viable. We thoughtfully review candidates for heart and lung transplant procedures with care and compassion, and these are often highly complex, difficult decisions. While our primary focus is the medical needs of the patient, the fact is that transplants require lifelong care and immunosuppression drugs, and therefore costs are sometimes a regrettable and unavoidable factor in the decision making process. We partner with our patients throughout their care and work closely with them to identify opportunities for financial assistance. Our clinical team has an ongoing dialogue with patients about their eligibility, holding frequent in-person meetings and informing patients in person to ensure they fully understand their specific situation. The hospital has not said how often it recommends that patients fundraise in order to receive transplants.

57eba0b9,"According to NOAA’s own historical data, of the 50 U.S. state all-time record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960 — climate change proponents are feeding us a fairy tale, and I’m sick of it… The maniacal sociopaths of the world may have won control of the narrative, but they seemingly have little sway over the will of the people. You need only browse the comment section below any “climate change” article or social media post to see the wave of folks resoundingly rejecting the scam-of-a-world-view assembled before them (one of the few positives of SM). The man-made global warming rejection is likely down to two things: the first being that the so called “scientific consensus” has been failing for far too long — you can’t start warning people in the 1980s that we have 10 years left to save the planet, only to keep repeating that prophecy for the next 4 decades. This is probably the reason our youth have become the new target — kids don’t have this history of failure to draw-upon when browsing the bullet points of the latest IPCC report -for example- meaning they’re far easier to manipulate. The second reason is likely the availability of climate information these days–namely historical data. Thanks to the internet, researching past climate catastrophes and comparing them to what’s happening today is a simple task. I’m talking about raw historical data, such as the number of deaths caused by a certain natural disaster, or the year and decade of the highest U.S. state temperature records: The raw data ALWAYS speaks for itself — out of the 50 U.S. state record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960. But the powers that be have constructed a rather tenacious, loud, and bullish narrative–as on top of the world burning to a crisp, the story also warns that droughts and floods are becoming more extreme. Comfortably crushing that assertion, however, is another NOAA nugget named the Palmer Drought Index — a century+ dataset plotting the portion of the continental U.S. that is either very wet or very dry. What the index reveals is that there is no significant trend of increasing drought or flood: An uptick in hurricanes is another li(n)e we’re fed, it’s actually listed as one of the main results of human-caused global warming. But again, there is no dataset out there that supports either an increase or an intensification of severe storms. In fact, quite the opposite is true, with 9 of the 13 strongest hurricanes to make U.S. landfall occurring prior to 1965. NOAA data shows both the number of hurricanes and the number of “strong” hurricanes making U.S. landfall declining since 1900. NOAA data also reveals that the number of strong tornadoes has been declining since the 1970s. When folks are permitted to look at climate data prior to 1980, natural cycles ALWAYS reveal themselves. There are ups & there are downs, and there are ups & downs within the ups & downs — and not a single scientist on the planet fully understands the mechanisms involved, no matter what you’re told. Saying that, however, sensible and tested “guesswork” is the basis of science. Recognizing the climate works in cycles means certain things can be predicted — the Grand Solar Minimum is one such cycle. Warmth is good for life on Earth, for biodiversity — the peaks of past human civilizations have ALWAYS coincided with Grand Solar Maximums (Minoans & Romans, for example), while their downfalls have ALWAYS been marked by Minimums and the coinciding temperature drops low solar activity brings. We humans should only ever be concerned with the COLD. If only man-made global warming was real… but as with ALL OTHER fairy tales to have ever done the rounds, these fabricated worries are put in place to control you, to have you lose sleep over something you can’t quite understand, and to have you pay, in one way or another, for your sins… Social Media channels are restricting Electroverse’s reach — be sure to subscribe to receive new post notifications by email (the box is located in the sidebar >>> or scroll down if on mobile).

58b372a7,"Bois State University told The Daily Wire Thursday that despite Wilson identifying himself as a student and an associate professor at the school, he is “not a current student nor employee of the university.” Original story: A Black Lives Matter activist in Boise, Idaho, has been arrested in connection to a vandalized statue of former President Abraham Lincoln. Terry Joe Wilson, 37, was arrested late Tuesday night after a warrant was issued for his arrest last week, The Idaho Statesman reported. Wilson has identified himself online as an associate professor at Boise State University and has been described by the press as the Boise Black Lives Matter chapter spokesman. Both physical and electronic evidence were reportedly used to identify suspects in the vandalism incident, which occurred in February. “[T]he bronze statue of Lincoln in Julia Davis Park — known as ‘Seated Lincoln’ — vandalized with feces, paint and signs,” The Idaho Statesman reported. “Parks and recreation staff were able to clean the statue, which was not permanently damaged.” The suspect fled from officers when he was first approached for his arrest, the Boise Police Department said. When he was tracked down, Wilson was found in possession of a firearm, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. “Officers chased after Wilson and were able to stop him and take him into custody, at which time Wilson was found to be in possession of a firearm, marijuana and drug paraphernalia,” said a press release from the department. “Wilson was taken to the hospital and was medically cleared before being booked into the Ada County Jail.” “Wilson was charged with several misdemeanor counts, including injuring monuments, ornaments and public improvements, resisting and obstructing officers, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia,” The Idaho Statesman reported. An account for Wilson describes himself as an associate professor at Boise State University.On Wilson’s Instagram page, one captioned photo from November railing against “fascist Donald Tump and neoliberal Joe Biden” identifies himself as “a student & faculty” at the university. The post, which also includes support for Black Lives Matter, reads as follows: Like the fascist @realdonaldtrump, the neoliberal @joebiden wants to increase police funding despite decades of research to support the position that police do not prevent crime. In-fact policing perpetuates crime & criminality with the support of the courts and corrections. As a student & faculty, I take matters on campus very seriously, not only for the safety of our students, but staff and faculty. The discussion around contemporary policing needs endless improvement, b/c the decision not to impeach current ASBSU President over concerns of anti-blackness under the guise of public safety is an absolute travesty. This is not over, as this should be taken very seriously b/c contemporary policing is a matter of public health.

Black Lives Matter❗️ #fuck12 #ACAB #ASBSU#fuckwhitesupremacy#fuckbigcitycoffee @astridwilde#blacklivesmatter #blmboise #blm#blacktranslivesmatter In an August 2020 report on a protest at the home of Council President Elaine Clegg, The Idaho Statesman described Wilson as the Boise Black Lives Matter chapter spokesperson. “Activists with the Boise chapter of Black Lives Matter drew chalk figures with chalk blood on the sidewalk while demonstrating in front of Council President Elaine Clegg’s North End home,” the report said. “… They also drew what appeared to be chalk outlines generally associated with homicide investigations on the sidewalk in front of her house. The outlines had red smears over where the hearts would be.” The report added: “Terry Wilson II, the spokesperson for the Boise chapter, said in a phone call the demonstration at Clegg’s home was because she was one of the four council members who voted to approve Mayor Lauren McLean’s 2021 budget. The 2021 budget allocates more money for the Boise Police Department, even though the overall budget decreased from 2020. … Wilson said the chapter wanted to hold Clegg accountable for her vote, which he called ‘bad policy.'” More arrests in connection to the vandalism incident are expected to be forthcoming.","Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein arrested and accused of sex trafficking minors, sources say",other
ac492afa,"Its researchers crunched the numbers on where public spending on transport across the country was going, and found a gap big enough you could lose a whole fleet of trains down there. Some key points: Yesterday, IPPR North, the arm of the centre left think tank concerned with, well, you can guess, put out a rather depressing report about the north-south divide in England’s transport funding. Click to expand. I have some quibbles about this. Crossrail will actually extend outside London into the East of England two stops in Essex and South East eight stops in Berkshire and Buckinghamshire which are, confusingly, given the region’s name, to the west of London; I don’t make the rules. It’s not clear the IPPR figures have accounted for this: Crossrail is mostly an investment in the London region, but it isn’t that entirely. Nonetheless, it’s very clear that London is swallowing a massively disproportionate share of Britain’s transport funding. This is clearly unfair. Yet it’s also, I fear, very unlikely to change. The concentration of transport funding in London is politically inevitable, and for at least four different reasons. Poll Privacy Policy 1 Population London is big: nearly 9m people live in the capital proper, and a few million more in the commuter towns beyond. It’s probably the most populous of England’s eight official regions we’re between censuses so we’re not sure, but in 2011 it was only half a million behind the South East, and has almost certainly overtaken it by now. More to the point, thanks to its extensive public transport network, London is integrated, in a way none of the others are: an investment in the centre will have benefits for the whole. That isn’t true of the other regions. A new branch of Manchester’s Metrolink, say, will be great for the bit of suburban Manchester that gets to join the network, but won’t be of direct use to much of the North West. That makes it harder to sell to the voters. Crossrail, though, can be sold as project that’ll benefit all Londoners – not to mention those who commute in from the counties surrounding it. It’s not an exaggeration to say that a fifth of the British population live somewhere in the project’s orbit. Result: politicians are more likely to prioritise another Crossrail than they are incremental improvements elsewhere. And yes, this does mean that London’s existing transport network gets it to the front of the queue for more transport investments. More on this below. 2 Economics The UK economy is ludicrously over-centralised. London generates a disproportionate share of UK GDP; London generates a disproportionate share of UK tax. All of which, one suspects, makes it easier for projects in London to get the green light from the the cost-benefit analysis which the Treasury uses to make spending decisions. Okay, the project costs a bomb… but, wow, look at the benefits! It’d be difficult to make the same case for, say, a metro in Bradford. There’s more: 3 Funding The government also tends to smile on projects where it doesn’t have to pay the entire cost. Businesses in London were so desperate for Crossrail that they were happy – at least, after a fashion – to contribute to it through the business rate supplement. Couldn’t northern businesses do the same, to show support for transport elsewhere? Well, yes – but there are fewer of them, and they’re not as rich. And most importantly of all… 4 It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy …they’re not dependent on an over-crowded public transport system to get their staff to work – because there isn’t one – so they’re less likely to feel the need to stump up. London businesses, though, are dependent on a decent public transport network. Those elsewhere are not. In other words, this whole disparity in funding is self-perpetuating. If London transport breaks, then it will genuinely hit London’s businesses, and that in turn will hit the national economy and the national Treasury. The capital is addicted to transport spending, and the country needs the capital. Oh, and: 5 Bubble The people who make the decisions are almost entirely based in London. So yes, that’s probably a factor too. I’m not saying this is good. It’s very, very un-good. It’s deeply, ludicrously unfair that, because London is richer and more dependent on public transport, that means it gets the lion’s share of funding forever more. It’s crazy. But it’s also really difficult to see how we get out of this. If we don’t invest in public transport in Leeds, well, sucks to be Leeds, but the rest of us will just get on with our day. If we don’t invest in public transport in London, then the country might actually start to break. And so, we’re stuck. For what it’s worth, this is one of the reasons I’m in favour of devolution. Those theoretical Bradford and Leeds metros might never rise up the national agenda. But they’d be pretty important to any West Yorkshire city region that may one day emerge. Many of the extensions of Manchester Metrolink have come about precisely because the 10 boroughs worked together to push for them. Until then, though, you can expect to see more graphs like the one the IPPR produced above, basically forever more. I’m not saying it’s good. I’m just saying it is. Sorry.

8c4367cb,"As the world ponders the fate of Egypt after Hosni Mubarak, Americans should ponder this: It’s quite possible that if Mubarak had not ruled Egypt as a dictator for the last 30 years, the World Trade Center would still be standing. This is true even though Mubarak’s regime has been a steadfast U.S. ally, a partner in our counterterrorism efforts and a foe of Islamic radicalism. Or, more aptly, it’s true because his regime has been all of these things. In “The Looming Tower,” his history of Al Qaeda, Lawrence Wright raises the possibility that “America’s tragedy on September 11 was born in the prisons of Egypt.” By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country’s Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri  Osama bin Laden’s chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda  out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad. At the same time, Mubarak’s relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview. Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it’s been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States. One of the men who made this leap was an architecture student named Mohamed Atta, who was at the cockpit when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the World Trade Center.",Weighing the Unknowns in Egypt - The New York Times,TRUE
2eb62dc6,"ADVERTISEMENT Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, EFCC, on Thursday at its Abuja office quizzed a senator and former governor of Abia State, Theodore Orji, over an allegation that he diverted N521 billion from the state to his personal use. Mr Orji’s son, Chinedum, who is the Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, was also quizzed alongside his father. The investigation followed a petition dated March 17, 2017, filed by a group, Fight Corruption: Save Nigeria Group. The petitioner accused Mr Orji, who served two terms as governor between 2007 and 2011, of withdrawing N500 million monthly as security vote from the state’s treasury during his eight years in office. Mr Orji, since leaving office as governor, has been serving as a senator. The petition accused him of diverting ”N383 billion revenue from the Federation Account, N55 billion Excess Crude revenue, N2.3 billion Sure-P revenue, N1.8 billion ecological funds, N10.5 billion loan, N12 billion Paris Club refund, N2 billion agricultural loan, and N55 billion ASOPADEC money while in office.” According to the petition, the N500million the former governor allegedly withdrew monthly was “not part of the security funds expended on the Nigerian Police, the Nigerian Army, DSS, Navy anti-Kidnapping Squad, anti-robbery Squad, purchase of Security equipment and vehicles for the security agencies.” The petitioner also accused Mr Orji’s son, Chinedum Orji, who is currently the Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly, of owning about 100 accounts in different banks. It added that the accounts which run both as corporate and Individual received ”so much deposit in cash without evidence of job or services rendered.” His investigations come months after the EFCC secured the conviction of his former boss and predecessor, Orji Kalu, on December 5. Orji Kalu was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment after being found guilty on 39 counts of fraud to the tune of N7.65 billion. Mr Orji currently represents Abia Central Senatorial District in the Senate. He served Mr Kalu as Chief of Staff before succeeding him as Abia governor. Mr Kalu is also a senator representing Abia North in the Red Chamber. The EFCC acting spokesperson, Tony Orilade, in a telephone interview with PREMIUM TIMES on Monday, confirmed that the commission was investigating the Orji family members accused in the petition. Mr Orilade said, ”Operatives of the Commission on Thursday, February 5, 2020, invited both Orji and his son in continuation of the investigation.” He said the two politicians were released on administrative bail but did not state when they are expected back at the commission. On why it took the EFFC over three years to begin investigations over the petition, Mr Orilade said the commission only followed its procedure for the exercise, saying investigations do not always begin immediately upon receipt of petitions.",Number of people with diabetes reaches over 4 million,TRUE
c94b8dc2,"Jeb Bush Really Is His Own Man By Stephanie Schriock, president, EMILY’s List Jeb Bush spent a lot of time this week trying to convince us that he’s different than his brother. His amateurish efforts to set himself apart on Iraq are cringeworthy and incoherent. And it’s painfully obvious that his campaign won’t be getting by without a little help from his big brother’s billionaire friends. But for all the bungled attempts to resolve his ever-present identity crisis, Jeb is right about one thing: When it comes to choice, he is “his own man.” The truth is that when George W. was president a little over a decade ago, we were living in a different time for the Republican Party. In that pre-transvaginal ultrasound, pre-“legimate rape” GOP era, someone like Olympia Snowe could be elected to the Senate and someone like George W. Bush could run for president without declaring himself to be anti-choice even in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman’s life is at stake. As president, he could even get away without cutting funding to Planned Parenthood! A few decades before that, Jeb’s father, George H. W. Bush, actually helped introduce family planning legislation in Congress — only moving his position on abortion and birth control to the right when he was nominated for vice president. And in his grandfather’s generation, Prescott Bush not only raised money for Planned Parenthood, but actually held a leadership position in the organization. So with all of Jeb’s bragging about being the most anti-choice candidate “in modern times,” he might finally have succeeded in getting his political apple to fall to the right of the family tree. But the reality is that what Jeb says doesn’t really matter all that much. Actions will always speak louder than words. And Jeb’s actions speak volumes about the kind of candidate — and the kind of president — he’s trying to become. After all, we’re talking about a man who once put the life of a disabled woman who’d been raped at risk by intervening legally to force her to carry her child to term — a move a Florida court later found illegal. We’re talking about a man who, as governor, signed a controversial abortion ban into law — and praised a similar measure passed by the House on Wednesday as “humane and compassionate.” We’re talking about a man who likes to defend his anti-choice record by saying “the most vulnerable in our society need to be protected” — even though he’s shown he’s not above playing politics with a child’s body, once going so far as governor as appealing the decision of a court that ruled a 13-year-old girl could have an abortion when her pregnancy posed an extreme risk to her health. We’re talking about someone who likes to talk a big game about how taxpayer dollars should never be used to fund abortions — even though he slipped millions in taxpayer dollars to Florida “crisis pregnancy centers” notorious for lying to and misleading women about their reproductive health choices. (This, in a state where 73 percent of counties have no abortion providers and crisis centers may be the only places women have to turn for the medical care they desperately need.) And let’s not forget that Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all. This is a candidate who will stop at nothing to win. And at the end of the day, while Jeb’s right-wing rhetoric might make him stand out from his family, in 2016’s ultra-conservative GOP presidential field, Jeb’s positions will just make him blend in. And if his struggle to define his position on Iraq this week is any indication, you never know where a desperate Jeb is going to go. EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics, has raised over $400 million to support pro-choice Democratic women candidates — making it one of the most successful political organizations ever. We recruit and train candidates, support strong campaigns, research women’s issues, and turn out women voters. We’ve trained over 9,000 women to run and helped elect over 100 women to the House, 19 to the Senate, 11 governors, and over 700 to state and local office. Since its founding in 1985, almost one-third of the candidates EMILY’s List has helped elect to Congress have been women of color — including every single Latina, African American, and Asian American Democratic Congresswoman currently serving.","Putin oversees hypersonic weapon test, says it’s ‘invulnerable’",partially false

According to the reports, the girl was taken to the hospital after she complained about stomach pains, couldn’t eat, and had been constipated for five days. The doctor performed a CT scan and reportedly found “unusual spherical shadows,” AKA undigested boba, dotting her colon all the way down her digestive system. According to EBC Dongsen News, the patient reluctantly admitted she had drank a bubble tea five days earlier; however, the doctor who treated her said it would have taken a lot more boba to get to this point. The doctor prescribed laxatives for the girl to get the undigested pearls out of her system. As EBC Dongsen News reports, the director of Zhuji People’s Hospital’s emergency department said that boba, being made of tapioca starch, are already difficult to digest, but some makers also use thickeners and preservatives, the significant consumption of which may lead to gastrointestinal problems.

a4246369,"The father of the Honduran girl who became the face of the family separation crisis has revealed that he still has not been in touch with his wife or daughter but was happy to learn they are safe. Denis Javier Varela Hernandez, 32, said that he had not heard from his wife Sandra, 32, who was with his two-year-old daughter Yanela Denise, for nearly three weeks until he saw the image of them being apprehended in Texas. In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Hernandez, who lives in Puerto Cortes, Honduras, says that he was told on Wednesday by a Honduran official in the US that his wife and child are being detained at a family residential center in Texas but are together and are doing 'fine.' 'You can imagine how I felt when I saw that photo of my daughter. It broke my heart. It's difficult as a father to see that, but I know now that they are not in danger. They are safer now than when they were making that journey to the border,' he said. Denis said his wife and daughter were never separated by border control agents and remain together. Denis Javier Varela Hernandez (far right) spoke out about his wife Sandra and daughter, Yanela Two-year-old Yanela, a Honduran asylum seeker, has become the face of the child separation crisis after she was photographed crying in McAllen, Texas, as Border Control agents searched her mother A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has told DailyMail.com that Sandra had been previously been deported from the US in 2013. The spokeswoman said that she was 'encountered by immigration officials in Hebbronville, Texas' in and sent back to Honduras 15 days later under 'expedited removal.' Sandra current immigration proceedings are 'ongoing' and she is being housed at a family detention center in Texas. Denis said that his wife had previously mentioned her wish to go to the United States for a 'better future' but did not tell him nor any of their family members that she was planning to make the trek. 'I didn't support it. I asked her, why? Why would she want to put our little girl through that? But it was her decision at the end of the day.' He said that Sandra had always wanted to experience 'the American dream' and hoped to find a good job in the States. Denis, who works as a captain at a port on the coast of Puerto Cortes, explained that things back home were fine but not great, and that his wife was seeking political asylum. He said that Sandra set out on the 1,800-mile journey with the baby girl on June 3, at 6am, and he has not heard from her since. 'I never got the chance to say goodbye to my daughter and now all I can do is wait', he said, adding that he hopes they are either granted political asylum or are sent back home. Yanela's father, Denis Javier Varela Hernandez (left), said that he had not heard from his daughter Yanela, one year and 11 months, and his wife for a month until he saw the image of them being apprehended Denis says that he has not spoken to his wife or daughter since they left for their journey from Puerto Cortes, Honduras, to the US on June 3 Above Sandra and little Yanela are seen being detained by US Border Patrol agents 'I don't have any resentment for my wife, but I do think it was irresponsible of her to take the baby with her in her arms because we don't know what could happen.' The couple has three other children, son Wesly, 14, and daughters Cindy, 11, and Brianna, six. 'The kids see what's happening. They're a little worried but I don't try to bring it up that much. They know their mother and sister are safe now.' Denis said that he believes the journey across the border is only worth it to some degree, and admits that it's not something he would ever consider. He said he heard from friends that his wife paid $6,000 for a coyote - a term for someone who smuggles people across the border. 'I wouldn't risk my life for it. It's hard to find a good job here and that's why many people choose to leave. But I thank God that I have a good job here. And I would never risk my life making that journey.' The heart-breaking photo was taken by Getty photographer John Moore close to midnight on the night of June 12 near McAllen, Texas, as the row over Donald Trump's separation of migrant parents and children escalated. Denis said that he hopes to use the photo and his family's situation to help him reunite with his daughter. 'I don't want money, what I want is someone to tell me that my daughter is going to be OK.' When asked about his views on Trump's border policy, Denis said: 'I've never seen it in a positive light the way others do. It violates human rights and children's rights. Separating children from their parents is just wrong. They are suffering and are traumatized. 'The laws need to be modified and we need to have a conversation. It's just not right. '[Illegal] Immigration and drug smuggling across the United States border is never gonna stop. They can build a wall and it's never going to stop,' he said. Sandra was part of a group that were caught by Border Patrol agents after making their way across the Rio Grande river on a raft. Hernandez's wife was part of a group that were caught by Border Patrol agents after making their way across the Rio Grande river on a raft. Hernandez said that he had heard through family members that his wife and daughter had not actually been separated Hernandez's daughters, Cindy, Yanela, and Brianna Moore's photo showed Yanela crying on a dirt track as her mother is patted down by a Border Patrol agent. For many the photo summed up the cruelty of Trump's 'zero tolerance' policy towards migrants which has caused 2,300 children to be separated from their mothers and fathers. A photo of Yanela was used on the front cover of TIME magazine to show the devastating effect of the policy, which was brought in in April. TIME magazine's July 2 cover features Yanela crying and looking up at President Donald Trump. The cover reads: 'Welcome to America' But actually Yanela remained with her mother after she arrived in the US after making the perilous 1,800 mile journey North through Central America and Mexico, TIME magazine later issued a clarification saying that the original version of its story accompanying the cover was wrong because Yanela ‘was not carried away screaming by Border Patrol Agents’. TIME’s editor in chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement that it stood behind the wider point which is that Yanela was ‘the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate’ Among those who have Tweeted DailyMail.com’s story have been White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She wrote: ‘It’s shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda. She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts’. Moore, who has worked on the border with Mexico for years and has won a Pulitzer for his photography, has said the the image of Yanela was the last one he took that night. Speaking to People magazine he said that the girl's mother was the last to be searched and a female agent asked her to put Yanela down so she could pat her down. Hernandez said that he wanted his wife and daughter to come home and that he would welcome them when they return Hernandez said that Yanela (center in her mother's arms) is the youngest of four children and she was the only one that traveled with her mother, a decision that surprised him Moore said: 'The mother hesitated and then set down the little girl and the child immediately started crying. ‘As a father, it was very emotional for me just to hear those cries. When I saw this little girl break down in tears I wanted to comfort this child. 'But as a photojournalist we sometimes have to keep photographing when things are hard. And tell a story that people would never see.' Moore crouched 6ft from the girl as she looked up at her mother and took seven shots, Yanela's mother's hands spread out on the Border Patrol truck. The image was a major factor in pressuring Trump to do a U-turn on his immigration policy and sign an executive order allowing families to stay together. The President said that he wanted to look strong but admitted that the 'zero tolerance' policy made him look like he had 'no heart'. Trump's climb down came after worldwide outrage including British Prime Minister Theresa May who called his policy 'deeply disturbing' while Pope Francis said it was 'immoral'. The climb down was a rare one from Trump, who almost never apologizes and rarely backs down. But he had not choice when his policy created a wall of opposition between him and others, including his own wife Melania, Democrats, Republicans, every living former First Lady, Amnesty International and the United Nations.

31d75b45,"Bernie Sanders, an independent, represents Vermont in the Senate and is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. Americans owe many of our freedoms to those who put their lives on the line for racial equality: people like Fannie Lou Hamer, Medgar Evers and Daisy Bates. But a racial wealth gap of 10 to 1 exists between white and black Americans, and that gap, along with the effects of racism, fuels disparities in areas ranging from health care to housing and from college debt to criminal sentencing. Many black Americans are disillusioned about politicians who champion the organizing power of black women when it’s time to turn out the vote but neglect their needs between election cycles. They are tired of politicians offering meaningful yet inadequate reforms — kicking the can of progress down the road instead of using their political capital to fight for reforms that current generations desperately need. They’re tired of coming in second to groups that hold the power of the purse or the might of demographic majority. And they’ve said enough is enough: The status quo is simply insufficient. I couldn’t agree more. Structural problems require structural solutions, and promises of mere “access” have never guaranteed black Americans equality in this country. Sixty-five years after Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, education has remained separate and unequal. “Access” to health care is an empty promise when you can’t afford high premiums, co-pays or deductibles. And an “opportunity” for an equal education is an opportunity in name only when you can’t afford to live in a good school district or to pay college tuition. Jobs, health care, criminal justice and education are linked, and progress will not be made unless we address the economic systems that oppress Americans at their root. As Princeton’s Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor recently argued, “There is no race without class in this country.” Yet most politicians won’t acknowledge the role that our economic system plays in maintaining racial inequality. Example after example shows that corporate exploitation disproportionately affects black people. Black Americans lost 40 percent of their wealth in the 2009 housing crisis, and were the target of predatory lenders. Black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be paid a minimum wage salary, and black Americans stand to benefit disproportionately from a $15 an hour federal minimum wage. Walmart is the largest private employer of African Americans in the country — 42 percent of its associates are black. And it pays its employees below a living wage — even while the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans. Former vice president Joe Biden recently said, “I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble.” I respectfully disagree. It is my view that any presidential candidate who claims to believe that black lives matter has to take on the institutions that have continually exploited black lives. The racial wealth gap lingers in part because the politicians who could close it are funded by the very corporate donors who continue to benefit from it. Gross inequality persists largely unchallenged despite the United States’ massive wealth because myths about racial inferiority and the “undeserving poor” justify the worst effects of unfettered capitalism. As long as corporations can rely on the indifference to black lives as a cover for their exploitation, they will continue to do so. Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, argues powerfully that corporations play a central role in “sustaining, or worsening, the forces of racism in America,” whether by advancing racist stereotypes, sponsoring voter suppression or exploiting low-wage workers who are disproportionately black and brown. And he’s right. The unfortunate truth is that politicians who take checks from millionaires and billionaires owe their corporate constituents first, and everyday Americans last. The black-white wealth gap could be closed by targeting the extreme wealth at the very top. Instead, politicians beholden to the one percent ask the black middle class and the white middle class to fight over scraps. I’m proud that our campaign is fueled by more small-dollar donations than any other — more of our donors work at Walmart than any other company. Our willingness to take on powerful special interests as we fight for universal health care and a living wage — instead of the private prison industry and tax breaks for the rich — is a direct consequence of my campaign’s financial independence. The straightest path to racial equality is through the one percent. A system where we don’t address both racial and economic disparity is a system in which some people, especially African Americans, are going to be left behind. We should not be swayed by those who would try to force us to choose one over the other.","Neil Mackay's Big Read: Inside Scotland’s education wars where parents, teachers and government are at daggers drawn",FALSE
9e8e9ddd,"ROME (Reuters) - It’s hard being a Catholic in Italy these days. St. Mark's Square is virtually deserted after a decree orders for the whole of Italy to be on lockdown in an unprecedented clampdown aimed at beating the coronavirus, in Venice, Italy, March 10, 2020. REUTERS/Manuel Silvestri You can walk into a church but you can’t cross yourself with holy water because the font is dry. You can’t get baptized or married in a church and you can’t even have a funeral. Just about the only thing a person can do in a church in Italy is pray - but at least a pew away from someone else. Overwhelmingly Catholic Italy is adapting to religion in a time of coronavirus after a clampdown across the entire country was imposed to slow Europe’s worst outbreak. Last Saturday, the Italian government issued a decree locking down much of the north, where the virus first broke out, and severely restricted indoor activities in the rest of the country. So on Sunday, Father Riccardo Lamba of the parish of San Ponziano, in a modern Rome neighborhood, took matters into his own hands. He moved the Mass outdoors and said it from the steps of his modern church. About 70 parishioners sat on plastic chairs with space between them and those who stood did so in formation as if they were about to take a gym class. Slideshow ( 2 images ) The government later took measures restricting outdoor gatherings. Lamba said he has not decided what he will do this Sunday. “We are praying. Many people are entering the church to pray during the day but trying to keep apart,” he said on Tuesday. His parish is not alone. Even St. Peter’s Basilica was eerily almost empty on Tuesday after the Vatican said only faithful who wanted to pray would be allowed in. Tourists and guided groups would not be allowed until at least April 3. “We are living day to day to see what happens. Sometimes the government changes its mind in a matter of hours,” Lamba said. “Thank God the hard-core faithful can watch a Mass on TV.” Church weddings have been blocked until at least April 3. The trickle down effect has hit the wedding planner industry on the cusp of spring, its high season. “We have closed the office for now and have to wait and see how things develop,” said Sabrina Bucci, head of Esclusivevent, which organizes weddings in Rome’s churches and receptions in an ancient villa with a view of the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica. She said five weddings had been postponed indefinitely. The coronavirus crisis has also changed the way Catholics say farewell to their dearly departed. Since funerals in churches have been banned, bodies are being taken directly to cemeteries either from hospitals or homes, denying families a traditional rite of passage that brings people together. “This morning’s funeral could not be held. A priest came to the home to bless the body and we took it directly to the cemetery,” said Stefano Chiericoni, head of one of Rome’s best-known undertakers. “We are doing what the health authorities are telling us to do and, in any case, we are wearing masks and protective gowns,” he said.",Steube Introduces Valid Benefits Act to Verify Eligibility for Federal Benefits,FALSE

Ehanire said: “I want to repeat that every person, including each of you here, has a right to privacy.

All lines of evidence point to the virus coming from an animal. That's consistent with what scientists have learned about the ecology of coronaviruses in the last 20 years,"" according to Timothy Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It fits with the fact that the virus shares 96% of its genome with a bat virus. ""The genetic data is pointing to this virus coming from a bat reservoir,"" he said, ""not a lab."" TRENDING: Question of election fraud will not go away ORIGINAL STORY: China, the World Health Organization and the U.S. National Institutes of Health have dimissed the theory that the virus causing the global pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people and devastated economies worldwide escaped from the Wuhan, China, lab funded by the United States. Advertisement - story continues below But there's no disputing the fact, as Newsweek reported in April 2020, that NIH executive Dr. Anthony Fauci promoted a highly controversial type of research involving the manipulation of viruses to explore their potential for infecting humans. And it's known that more than 200 scientists pressured the Obama administration in 2014 to temporarily halt U.S. funding for that research because of the risk of a manipulated virus accidentally escaping a lab and igniting a pandemic. Nevertheless, under Fauci's direction, the dangerous virus engineering resumed in 2017 and continued until April 2020. Now, documentary evidence makes it a ""near certainty"" that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, where so-called ""gain-of-function"" research was funded by Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, according to Steve Hilton, who is leading a special investigation for his Fox News show ""The Next Revolution."" Significantly, his investigation found a direct link between a bat coronavirus discovered a decade ago in a mine in Yunnan province and one that had been engineered in the Wuhan lab, 1,000 miles away. Hilton noted on his show Sunday night that scientists at the Wuhan lab published a paper in February 2020 stating they had recently discovered a virus in Yunnan province that ""showed high sequence identity"" to COVID-19. However, Hilton discovered after running the virus's genome sequence through the NIH's GenBank database that only one virus was an exact match to COVID-19. It wasn't the virus discovered recently. It was the once discovered a decade ago in Yunnan province that killed miners who had stirred up bat feces. Advertisement - story continues below Hilton found it curious that the Wuhan researchers not only didn't reveal that fact, they changed the name of the Yunnan virus, as indicated by GenBank. As evidence that the Yunnan virus was manipulated in the Wuhan lab, Hilton pointed out that the two viruses are the same, except for two key elements: The COVID-19 virus is more infectious and can enter human cells in the respiratory system. ""Those are the exact places in the viral sequence where gain-of-function techniques would be applied, if ... you were funded by the NAID to research bat coronaviruses to explore emergences or spillover potential,"" he said. ""Spillover potential"" refers to the ability of a virus to jump from animals to humans. That exact gain-of-function research, he pointed out, was touted in a Nov. 30, 2017, progress report tied to an NAID grant. The crucial question, Hilton said, was whether the virus at the center of that U.S.-funded work was the one that was discovered in the mine a decade ago. ""The match between that virus and the work commissioned by NAID is so perfect, it's impossible to believe they weren't,"" he said. He noted that workers in the Wuhan lab were the first identified cases of COVID-19 in the fall of 2019.",FALSE
92e17268,"Western media recently launched a new round of attacks on China's religious freedom. The country's major religious associations on Tuesday proposed an initiative demanding that all religious venues raise China's national flag to strengthen awareness of respect for the flag and preserve the flag's dignity. This move, however, was interpreted by some Western media outlets as an attempt to expand the country's ideological control over religious life. Over two months ago when the China Islamic Association urged mosques in China to fly national flags to promote patriotism among Muslims, the West also accused China of tightening its grip on religion and intervening in religious freedom. A national flag is a symbol of the country that should be respected by all citizens. The display of national flags is not only recognition of national sovereignty, but also a manifestation of love for the country. Hanging a flag at religious sites is meant to enhance the concept of nation and civic consciousness among religious people. Promoting patriotism isn't at odds with protecting freedom of religion, Islam, for instance, emphasizes patriotism as a part of faith. For multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries like China, strengthening people's national and civic consciousness is of particular importance. Colonialists divided national borders according to nationality and religion, which led to serious conflicts to Asian countries, as is the case with India and Pakistan. China must draw lessons from this and ratchet up efforts to build religious people's national and civic consciousness. Religions are exclusive. The key to make them live in harmony is to sustain their national identity. If the shared sense of national identity collapsed, the country would be divided or even lurch toward war. Thanks to China's effective religious governance, religions have developed rapidly in China over the years. The Chinese government adopts the principle of separating religion from politics and respects freedom of religion. Legal religious activities are not only allowed in any region of China, but also well protected. However in an attempt to divide China's national unity, many Western forces have repeatedly made an issue of the country's religious freedom, making groundless claims that religious groups are suppressed in China. When the American flag is raised, all Americans, regardless of race or religion, stand up to show their respect. China has every reason to strengthen national identity and civic consciousness among religious people. Flying the national flag at religious sites is a good way to do so. Without a stable country as the foundation of religious belief, religion will only cause division.","THIS IS AMAZING: In 1984, the New York Times said Trump would be our BEST president…They forgot…..",FALSE
024c4379,"A new study by researchers at Turku University in Finland found that the human contribution to a rise of 0.1°C in global temperatures over the last century is just 0.01°C. The paper, titled ‘No experimental evidence for the significant anthropogenic climate change’ was published by Jyrki Kauppinen and Pekka Malmi. The study found that, “During the last hundred years the temperature is increased about 0.1°C because of carbon dioxide. The human contribution was about 0.01°C.” Kauppinen and Malmi conclude that global temperatures are controlled primarily by cloud cover and that “only a small part” of the increased carbon dioxide concentration is anthropogenic. The study also calls into question the claims of the UN IPCC, which concluded that global temperatures are largely driven by human activity. While the methods and results of the study can be debated, this once again illustrates how there is no overwhelming consensus on man-made global warming as the media often claims. In reality, there are dozens of prominent scientists who believe that climate change is driven by natural forces or that the United Nations’ climate projections are unreliable.

The director of the CDC would be one, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics probably another. Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, the former director of medical research at the prestigious Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins University, would be the third. For years Dr. Zimmerman served as a go-to expert in “vaccine court” to dispute parental claims that vaccines caused their children’s autism. And as the reigning national expert on the topic of autism in the scientific community, Dr. Zimmerman’s opinions held tremendous weight: His written testimony helped deny the claims of the families of more than five thousand children with autism during an Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2009 in vaccine court, as I will explain in a moment. In the late 1990s a young doctor fresh out of medical school joined the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore as a resident and worked closely with Dr. Zimmerman. His name was Jon Poling. In 2000 Dr. Poling’s nineteen-month-old daughter, Hannah, experienced a massive regression into autism after her vaccinations, much as happened to my son. Unlike my son, Hannah’s parents had access to the most sophisticated autism research center in the world, and Dr. Zimmerman and several of his colleagues, including Dr. Richard Kelley, who was serving as director of Kennedy Krieger’s laboratory, tried to figure out what had happened to her, and why. Of course, everyone at Kennedy Krieger initially approached the idea that vaccines had played a role in Hannah’s regression skeptically, including Dr. Poling himself. He was a decidedly mainstream neurologist, having attended Georgetown to get both his MD and PhD. He and his wife Teri had fully vaccinated Hannah, and he’d explain many times over the next few years that he wouldn’t have believed it if he hadn’t seen it himself. Through an unexpected series of events, Dr. Poling and Dr. Zimmerman, colleagues at the most prestigious autism research facility in the world, nearly ended the autism epidemic in 2008. Because of Hannah Poling, Dr. Zimmerman became convinced that vaccines are indeed capable of causing autism under certain circumstances, representing a change in his previously held positions. Like any good scientist, Dr. Zimmerman appeared willing to go where the evidence took him, even toward something as inconvenient as a vaccine-autism connection. Dr. Zimmerman’s professional opinion about what caused Hannah’s autism, given the tremendous weight he carried within the scientific c community and his long-time role as an expert witness, triggered a panic at both the CDC and the Department of Justice. It led to a quick twenty-million-dollar settlement with the Polings in 2010, but not before Hannah’s story became worldwide news.2 I’ve always had so many questions about the Hannah Poling case, Dr. Zimmerman, Dr. Kelley, and Dr. Poling. Soon after the news spectacle, the Polings disappeared from the public, never to be heard from again. Sources have told me that the Department of Justice made it clear to the Polings that if they wanted to receive their vaccine court compensation, they needed to keep quiet. They appear to have complied. Very recently, however, Drs. Zimmerman and Kelley privately agreed to serve as expert witnesses in the first vaccine injury trial of any kind in a regular courtroom in more than thirty years. The trial is a medical negligence case in Tennessee, alleging that a pediatrician allowed a child to develop autism by vaccinating him when there was clearly excessive risk, based on previous reactions he’d had to vaccines. The boy’s name is Yates Hazlehurst, and he was one of three “test cases” in the aforementioned Omnibus Autism Proceeding back in 2009—only a year prior to the DOJ’s settlement with the Poling family—a case that was lost partially based on the written testimony of Dr. Zimmerman.3 Drs. Zimmerman and Kelley, under oath, provided depositions for the trial as expert witnesses. What’s significant is that in the future they would be testifying on behalf of the Hazlehurst family, confirming that in Yates’s case, vaccines caused his autism. Yes, you read that right. In 2009 the Omnibus Autism Proceeding concluded that Yates Hazlehurst’s autism was not caused by vaccination, a decision based partially on Dr. Zimmerman’s testimony—and a decision that, significantly, served as the basis for denying claims to more than five thousand other children. Fast forward to 2017, and Drs. Kelley and Zimmerman are expert witnesses for the same child, and they are both saying, “with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty,” that vaccines caused Yates’s autism. Confused yet? I know I was. Let’s start at the beginning. The “Vaccine Court” If vaccines cause autism, you’d think “vaccine court” would be a great place to find the evidence for it. Compensated claims typically include extensive details about timelines, medical tests, and doctors’ opinions. They read more like case reports in medical journals than legal settlements. Established through the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, the original purpose of the vaccine court (officially called the United States Court of Federal Claims special masters) was to quickly and expeditiously pay any claims made by American citizens for vaccine injury. The vaccine court is buried within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and when you petition the vaccine court because of a vaccine injury, you’re actually suing the federal government, and the lawyer representing the government (and therefore opposing your claim) will be a Department of Justice lawyer. Due process in vaccine court is nonexistent. there’s no jury, just a single court-appointed “special master” who hears your case and makes a decision. Since 1989, when the vaccine court began to operate, these special masters have awarded more than $3.8 billion to vaccine-injured Americans (children and adults).4 Of the total cases filed since the court came into existence in 1998, there have been twelve hundred claims filed for death and eighteen thousand filed for injury. The DTP vaccine is the most common vaccine for claims to be filed against, with MMR in second place. Of the people who file claims with the court, approximately 34 percent end up receiving compensation; 2017 was actually the single biggest year for claims paid, with just over $282 million. Rolf Hazlehurst, an assistant attorney general from Tennessee, has been an outspoken critic of the vaccine court, particularly since he had to fight his way through it as a claimant on behalf of his son Yates, who he believes developed autism as a result of his vaccinations. In a memorandum to the US Congress in 2013, Rolf Hazlehurst described the court: Vaccine court is not a court of law. It is an administrative proceeding in which the most basic rules of law do not apply. In vaccine court, the Rules of Discovery, Evidence and Civil Procedure do not apply. There is also no judge or jury. In vaccine court, the American legal system has been replaced by what is known as a special master. A special master is an appointed government attorney.5",FALSE
ef0f1066,"April 3, 2020 Hon. Bill de Blasio Mayor of the City of New York City Hall New York, NY 10007 Hon. Andrew M. Cuomo Governor of New York State NYS State Capitol Building Albany, NY 12224 Re: Meeting the need for isolation space for homeless New Yorkers Dear Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo: There is an urgent humanitarian crisis among homeless New Yorkers with the spread of COVID19. There are approximately 70,000 people sleeping in DHS, HRA, DYCD, and HPD shelters each night, including 19,000 single adults sleeping in Department of Homeless Services (DHS) congregate shelters and many more individuals sleeping in other congregate shelter systems. Thousands of homeless New Yorkers are still struggling to survive on the streets while contending with a drastic reduction in access to food, hygiene supplies, bathrooms, showers, and clothing. The economic upheaval brought on by the public health crisis is already leading to increased homelessness among the scores of precariously housed New Yorkers. Homeless adults, who are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe complications, are in desperate need of private places to self-isolate. In the week ending with March 21, 2020, only 16.8 percent of all hotel rooms in New York City were occupied, leaving an 83.2-percent vacancy rate. This means there are currently more than 100,000 vacant hotel rooms that could be used to temporarily house homeless New Yorkers. Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo: The undersigned organizations urge you to immediately use this resource in order to 1.) prevent the spread of COVID-19 among an extremely vulnerable homeless population, 2.) reduce the severity of illness for homeless people in need of a private space to care for themselves but who do not require hospitalization, and 3.) help prevent overcrowding and virus spread in hospital inpatient units and emergency departments due to a lack of appropriate discharge locations for homeless individuals. In addition to the need for hotel beds, you must drastically improve access to these beds and communication among shelter providers, hospital staff, and homeless individuals. As it stands, advocates and health care providers have witnessed an array of problems accessing the alreadylimited supply of approximately 200 isolation shelter beds: Individuals have been discharged back to congregate shelters while awaiting COVID-19 test results; hospitals have been unable to reach DHS for guidance on isolation shelter placements; and multiple individuals have been denied access to isolation shelter beds because they were not recently in the DHS shelter system (including youth, unsheltered individuals, and newly homeless people). All of these scenarios are worsening an already unspeakably deadly crisis. Furthermore, although DHS has set up a procurement process for providers to operate isolation shelter beds in hotels, they have crafted the contract requirements in such an onerous way as to preclude nearly all providers from bidding. According to the procurement standards, these contracts will require their nurses to supply their own personal protective equipment (PPE), which is nearly impossible for individual providers to do because of the present severely limited supply. As of April 1st, there were 136 cases of COVID-19 reported in 74 DHS shelters, in addition to seven homeless New Yorkers testing positive while living on the streets. On April 1st, 35 homeless people were hospitalized and five deaths had been reported. Because testing and access to treatment for people with mild illness is limited, the extent of illness and death among homeless New Yorkers is likely already far more extensive than what is officially reported – and similar to the experience of other vulnerable populations living in nursing homes and jails, it is growing daily. The latest federal stimulus bill provides $4 billion in Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds, and New York City is likely to receive hundreds of millions in aid as a result. ESG funds can be used to provide temporary emergency shelters such as hotels (waiving federal habitability and environmental review standards), staff costs, training, and hazard pay. Funding is available. There is no excuse not to act. All homeless individuals in congregate settings need the ability to practice safe social distancing and the City and State must provide resources to make this possible. To this end, the undersigned organizations call on Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo to immediately open thousands of hotel rooms to provide isolation for: • Every homeless individual on the streets; • All homeless individuals in shelters who are likely ill because they are experiencing symptoms or are COVID-19 positive; • All homeless persons in congregate settings who are highly vulnerable because of known or self-reported underlying health conditions, age, or other relevant conditions; and • Newly homeless individuals who require isolation because of symptoms or a positive diagnosis and who have not accessed DHS shelter in the past year or ever. We additionally call on Mayor de Blasio and the Department of Homeless Services to immediately reduce bureaucratic barriers to accessing isolation space by: • Allowing a “no wrong door” approach to accessing isolation shelters, including through outreach teams, shelter staff, or health care providers; • Relaxing requirements that staff be present at isolation hotels if necessary to open isolation beds quickly; and • Allowing congregate shelter providers and/or DHS to switch operations of individual congregate shelters to commercial hotels. Lastly, we urge Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio to prioritize any staff at isolation hotels and shelters where staff or shelter residents have tested positive for COVID-19 or have COVID19-like illnesses for access to incoming supplies of PPE.

a496cc6b,"The growing stream of reporting on and data about fake news, misinformation, partisan content, and news literacy is hard to keep up with. This weekly roundup offers the highlights of what you might have missed. Who shares the most “junk news”? (But “junk news” ≠ fake news.) Trump supporters and the far right: That’s according to a report out this week from the Computational Propaganda Project at the University of Oxford. But be careful of definitions here! Over three months leading up to Trump’s State of the Union Address this past January, Oxford researchers looked at “the distribution of posts and comments on public pages that contain links to junk news sources, across the political spectrum in the U.S. We then map the influence of central sources of junk political news and information that regularly publish content on hot-button issues in the U.S.” Note the use of the term “junk news.” The paper’s definition of it includes a wide variety of sites and sources — yes, many what would broadly be considered “fake news,” but also partisan sites, especially conservative ones like Breitbart, the Drudge Report, the Daily Caller, and NewsMax (plus liberal ones like Crooks and Liars and Occupy Democrats). And it also includes some real headscratchers: the National Review, the New York Daily News, Mediaite, the polling site Rasmussen Reports, and the conservative nonprofit Judicial Watch. You may disagree with some or all of those sites from day to day, but it’s an odd choice to lump them all together with “‘Spirit cooking’: Clinton campaign chairman practices bizarre occult ritual” and “Breaking: FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network,” as the paper does. (“Junk news” publishers “deliberately publish misleading, deceptive or incorrect information purporting to be real news about politics, economics or culture,” according to the authors. “This content includes various forms of propaganda and ideologically extreme, hyper-partisan, or conspiratorial news and information.” The paper outlines a multilayered test to determine a publisher’s junkiness; among the criteria are “emotionally driven language with emotive expressions,” “misleading headlines,” and “excessive capitalization.”) Looking at nearly 48,000 public Facebook pages and tweets from 14,000 users, the researchers found that a network of Trump supporters on Twitter “shares the widest range of known junk news sources and circulates more junk news than all the other groups together,” while on Facebook, far-right pages shared and circulated it the most.

It’s stuff you might call commentary masking as news, if you were being generous.” (Again with the capitalization!) What it’s not is straight “fake news” — no matter how you see it covered by outlets like The Guardian (“Fake news sharing in US is a rightwing thing, says study”), Mother Jones (“Trump Supporters Spread the Majority of Phony News on Social Media”), or Newsweek (“LIBERALS DON’T SHARE OR BELIEVE FAKE NEWS AS MUCH AS RIGHT-WINGERS, STUDY FINDS”). Misleading headlines and excessive capitalization — don’t let Oxford catch you, Newsweek! The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple writes: Banging out a news taxonomy is a towering challenge. There’s just way too much news, way too many sources, and way too many tweets and Facebook postings out there. Given that ocean, the Oxford folks devised a sensible plan: Reach judgments about news sources, and then examine how stories from those sources get passed around. Yet the apparent overclassification of some right-wing sites raises the possibility that the study, at least in part, merely caught conservatives sharing conservative journalism. Facebook met with its fact-checking partners. “My general takeaway is that Facebook is stepping up its commitment to this partnership by investing a lot more internal resources in the third-party fact-checking product,” writes Poynter/ICFN’s Alexios Mantzarlis, who was at the meeting. It also sounds as if more data will be released soon. Poynter’s Daniel Funke had written about what fact checkers were hoping for from the meeting.

579b38da,"Since taking office in 2009, President Barack Obama has formally proposed a total of 442 tax increases, according to an Americans for Tax Reform analysis of Obama administration budgets for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. The 442 total proposed tax increases does not include the 20 tax increases Obama signed into law as part of Obamacare. “History tells us what Obama was able to do. This list reminds us of what Obama wanted to do,” said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. The number of proposed tax increases per year is as follows: -79 tax increases for FY 2010 -52 tax increases for FY 2011 -47 tax increases for FY 2012 -34 tax increases for FY 2013 -137 tax increases for FY 2014 -93 tax increases for FY 2015 Perhaps not coincidentally, the Obama budget with the lowest number of proposed tax increases was released during an election year: In February 2012, Obama released his FY 2013 budget, with “only” 34 proposed tax increases. Once safely re-elected, Obama came back with a vengeance, proposing 137 tax increases, a personal record high for the 44th President. In addition to the 442 tax increases in his annual budget proposals, the 20 signed into law as part of Obamacare, and the massive tobacco tax hike signed into law on the sixteenth day of his presidency, Obama has made it clear he is open to other broad-based tax increases. During an interview with Men’s Health in 2009, when asked about the idea of national tax on soda and sugary drinks, the President said, ""I actually think it's an idea that we should be exploring."" During an interview with CNBC’s John Harwood in 2010, Obama said a European-style Value-Added-Tax was “something that would be novel for the United States.” Obama’s statement was consistent with a pattern of remarks made by Obama White House officials refusing to rule out a VAT. “Presidents are judged by history based on what they did in power. But presidents can only enact laws when the Congress agrees,” said Norquist. ""Thus a record forged by such compromise tells you what a president -- limited by congress -- did rather than what he wanted to do.” The full list of proposed Obama tax increases can be found here.","Rep.

08294d0a,"Nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites would lose benefits under proposed Trump administration food stamp rule MADISON - Nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites would lose food benefits under a rule change President Donald Trump’s administration is pursuing. The change would boost costs for Wisconsin taxpayers by millions of dollars a year because the state would have to upgrade the computer systems that administer the FoodShare program, retrain workers and more thoroughly scrutinize the assets of people who apply for benefits. The computer upgrade would cost $2.3 million, according to the state Department of Health Services. Operational costs would rise by $17.7 million a year. State and local taxpayers would have to pick up about half of both sets of costs, with the federal government paying for the rest. “The bottom line is you’d have more cost on bureaucracy and administration and fewer benefits going to Wisconsinites,” Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul said. Kaul and 23 other attorneys general sent a letter last week urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture not to implement the new rule for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, which is widely known as the food stamp program. In Wisconsin, it is called FoodShare. Other Wisconsin Democrats, including Gov. Tony Evers and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, are fighting the proposed rule. But U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, a Republican from Glenbeulah, argued the new rule would help ensure only the deserving receive benefits. “A lot of people didn’t know that millionaires are eligible for food stamps,” he said. “I’m glad Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it.” Nearly 40 million people, including about 644,000 Wisconsinites, received food stamps in 2018. Like most states, Wisconsin provides food benefits to people who qualify for other government programs without performing additional income and asset tests. The proposed rule would bar people in other programs from automatically qualifying for food stamps. Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250. For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the proposed rule is meant to prevent wealthy people from qualifying for food stamps. He cited the example of Rob Undersander, a Minnesota man who conducted what he called a citizen’s audit of the food stamp program. Undersander told Minnesota lawmakers last year he received about $300 a month in food stamps for 19 months despite having more than $1 million in property and retirement accounts, according to WCCO-TV and Forum News Service. He was able to qualify for those benefits because he had little income. “What we’re trying to do is make it fair and equal across everyone, where everyone who qualifies for food stamps based on the rules that Congress has passed, both asset and income tests, can qualify just as they always have,” Perdue told reporters Tuesday at the World Dairy Expo in Madison. “Those people who become categorically eligible, as in that fellow from Minnesota who tested the system as a millionaire and qualified for food stamps, we don’t want that happening.” But Kaul said the proposed rule would primarily hurt people who are struggling. “The majority of people who are going to be affected are children and seniors,"" the attorney general said. ""Undermining food security for children and seniors ... is cruel.” Nearly 3 million food stamp recipients across the country would lose their benefits if the rule change went into effect, according to estimates by Perdue’s Department of Agriculture. The rule would also result in children losing access to school lunches because many schools automatically provide free meals to children if they receive food stamps. In Wisconsin, about 39,600 people in about 24,100 households would lose more than $11 million in benefits a year, according to estimates from the state Department of Health Services. Of those, about 13,000 are children and about 11,000 are senior citizens. To accommodate the rule change, the state would have to spend $2.3 million modifying its computer systems and retraining those who use it, according to the state. State taxpayers would have to cover half that cost, with the federal government picking up the other half. In addition, the cost of operating the program would increase by $17.7 million a year for Wisconsin. That’s because of additional training, longer application processing time and more review of applicants' assets, according to the department. About half the higher annual costs would fall to local and state taxpayers, with the rest paid by the federal government, according to the state Department of Health Services. Administrative costs are shared by the federal government and the states. The federal government covers the cost of the benefits, which totaled nearly $65 billion nationally in 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture took public comments on the proposed rule change through last week. It hasn’t set a date for deciding whether to advance the rule. “We shouldn’t be making it harder for struggling Americans to make ends meet and put food on the table — which is what this proposed regulation would do,” Evers and Democratic governors from 16 other states wrote in a letter to the Agriculture Department.

Now a Public Health England report confirms that infections increase during the fortnight after vaccination. British Government Study Confirms Covid-19 Vaccine Risk: Infections INCREASE in Fortnight after Jab Anyone raising concern about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines faces derision as an ‘anti-vaxxer’, but the real extremists are those who refuse to hear evidence that something is going badly wrong with this mass experimental encroachment on the sanctity of the body. Now a Public Health England report confirms that infections increase during the fortnight after vaccination. Advertisement - story continues below As the vaccination programme began in earnest in January, worrying signs came from care homes, where many of the initial target population of people aged over 80 reside. At Pemberley House in Basingstoke, England, a third of the residents died of Covid-19. The death toll of 24 was unusual in a home that had previously been free from the disease. Similar reports emerged from Germany. The clearest indications came from small countries that strove to vaccinate their entire adult population. The British enclave of Gibraltar was supplied with the Pfizer vaccine on 16th January and the elderly were swiftly jabbed. Suddenly this tiny state, home to 33 thousand, had the worst Covid-19 morality in the world (2761 per million). From merely 9 deaths in December, now almost a hundred have died. The health minister angrily denied claims that the vaccine was killing people, but eventually admitted that some deaths had occurred soon after the jab. The United Arab Emirates received large batches of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine as well as the Pfizer product in December. As stated by Amer Sharif, head of the Covid-19 Command & Control Centre in Dubai, the UAE aimed to be the first country in the world to achieve 100% vaccination of eligible adults. An increase in deaths was attributed to mutant strains, but as in other countries the rate rose disproportionately in the vaccinated age band. On 10th February a new daily high of 18 deaths from the coronavirus was recorded, and the trend has continued. Considerably more people are dying than in the first wave last spring. More evidence of iatrogenic harm came from Israel, which started vaccinating on 19th December. As reported by former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson, while Covid-19 mortality escalated among Israelis throughout January, in Palestine it declined steeply after a surge in December. Yet the Palestinians had no vaccine. This correlation is more than coincidental. Analysis of Israeli health ministry data by Hervé Seligmann at Aix-Marseilles University indicates that about 40 times more elderly people died of Covid-19 in the three weeks between their first and second doses than among those who were not vaccinated. Sacrificial lambs? Deaths in Israel are now falling, which politicians and media attribute to the vaccine, although there is a global trend of the virus becoming less deadly. It should not be unexpected that Covid-19 vaccines have deleterious as well as intended effects. Pfizer data shows significant lymphocyte depletion in the first week after vaccination. June Raine, chief of the UK medicines regulator MHRA, acknowledged that ‘a week or two’ is needed to build up immunity after the first jab. The Public Health England study, which was hailed by health secretary Matt Hancock for the reported 80% decrease in hospitalisations, actually showed a 48% rise in infections after the first dose of Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines. The authors, however, blamed this on a higher risk of exposure. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, stated that ‘this adds to growing evidence that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives’. She glossed over the hundreds who died after getting the jab. This is what may be happening. Vulnerable people who unknowingly had Covid-19 or whose immune system was keeping it at bay, succumbed to the disease after the vaccine lowered their immunity. The virus struck hard, leading to sever symptoms, cytokine storm and pneumonia. It is also possible that previously shielding persons were cross-infected by the vaccinators. This needs proper scrutiny, not reckless denial by those who are meant to protect us. This defensiveness and censorship is how the thalidomide scandal arose. The authorities have apparently cast aside everything we have learned about ethical safeguards in clinical and experimental treatment. Perhaps it is relevant that the British medicine regulator is heavily funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Why aren’t doctors raising the alert? In medical training, hardly a day is given to learning about vaccines, and Big Pharma has undue influence on this noble profession. With critical thinking and dissent stifled by the Covid regime, most doctors are mere conformists. We must appeal to the brave few medics to continue their efforts to expose the deadly hazard of this highly dubious intervention.Why aren’t doctors raising the alert?

5285404b,Home Run King Hank Aaron Dies of ‘Undisclosed Cause’ 18 Days After Receiving Moderna Vaccine,"Baseball legend Hank Aaron, who received the Moderna COVID vaccine on Jan. 5, has died. According to the New York Times, the Atlanta Braves confirmed the 86-year-old Hall of Famer’s death today, but did not provide further details. CNN reported that Aaron died “peacefully in his sleep,” and that no cause of death was disclosed. Aaron made headlines earlier this month when he was photographed getting the Moderna vaccine. He told the Associated Press at the time that getting vaccinated “makes me feel wonderful.” He added: “I don’t have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. … It’s just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.” Aaron was vaccinated at the Morehouse School of Medicine health clinic in Atlanta, in what news reports said was an attempt to inspire other Black Americans to step up to the plate and get the vaccine. The AP reported at the time: “Rolling up their sleeves to take the first of two doses, these octogenarians, their spouses and several other civil rights leaders who received the shots in a brand-new health clinic at the Morehouse School of Medicine acknowledged the legacy of mistrust that many African Americans have toward medical research, stemming from the infamous Tuskegee experiment in which U.S. health workers left syphilis untreated in Black men without their consent, making them suffer needlessly.” In December, VOX reported on the launch of a global campaign using influencers and celebrities to help overcome “vaccine hesitancy,” stating that it “will be unprecedented” and many institutions will have a role, including government and public health authorities. However, health officials continue to encounter pushback, including from healthcare workers. Adverse events to the COVID vaccine have been reported worldwide. Germany and Norway have reported a combined 43 deaths among elderly people who received the Pfizer vaccine, prompting China health officials to call for the vaccines to be suspended, especially among the elderly. On learning of Aaron’s death, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said: “Aaron’s tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines.” “Studies show that self-interested pharmaceutical company researchers, physicians, nursing homes and health officials seldom report vaccine injuries. Instead, they dismiss injuries and deaths as ‘unrelated’ to vaccination,” Kennedy said. “Public health advocates worry that the vast majority of injuries and deaths will go unreported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), the notoriously broken voluntary surveillance system run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).” A 2001 HHS study concluded that “fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries” are reported to VAERS. As The Defender reported last week, California was forced to recall a batch of 330,000 Moderna vaccines after a cascade of reported injuries, though now the company says it’s okay to resume administration of that batch. The Defender also covered the story of a 56-year-old Florida doctor who died about two weeks after getting his first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. His death is under investigation by Florida health officials. In addition, multiple severe allergic reactions have been directly linked to the Pfizer vaccine.",partially false

80450400,"The construction of a radiation-free house at Brainport Smart District will start next year. Students of the Eindhoven University of Technology have been looking for an optimal combination of materials and building constructions to allow as little radiation as possible into the house. Some people suffer from electromagnetic radiation, which manifests itself for example in headaches or sleeping problems. They themselves often do not have devices that cause radiation and this house also reduces the radiation from outside. Kendal Varolgunes, architecture student and team leader of the student team Layer, emphasizes that the students are mainly concerned with the architectural aspects of the house. “We’re not investigating to what extent the radiation is harmful to people, that’s up to medical specialists,” he says. A study by the European Economic and Social Committee shows that three to five percent of Europeans are sensitive to radiation. That amounts to about 13 million people. However, it is not scientifically proven that the complaints people experience are actually from electromagnetic radiation. Varolgunes expects that in the future people, with or without complaints, will become more aware of the amount of radiation in their homes and that they want a solution for this. “We see that in other countries standards have already been drawn up about the permissible amount of radiation in a house. Just as there are noise standards,” he explains. “This is not yet the case in the Netherlands. That’s why we’re going to investigate this.” Subscribe to IO on Telegram!

Tiny houses The first radiation-free house on the Brainport Smart District will be a kind of tiny house. “That’s an ideal form for this application,” says Varolgunes. The architecture student explains that it is sometimes difficult for families if a family member is radiation sensitive. “For example, they can’t handle telephones and the wifi router, while others just want to watch Netflix. The students designed the houses in such a way that they can then connect several tiny houses to each other. “That way, everyone has their own space and altogether it’s one house after all.” The students have worked out a so-called prefab concept. Parts of the house are already being produced elsewhere so that the houses can be built and demolished very quickly. “In the first house we want to do a lot of tests, for example, to see how the radiation density of materials changes over time,” says Varolgunes. Prior to the concept development, they also tested the materials and possible structures of the house extensively. “But in practice, it turns out differently. So it’s good to keep measuring,” he says. Recently he also had contact with someone who is sensitive to radiation. “If it all works out financially, she will live in the first house,” he says. Renovation package Besides the complete houses, the students also want to look at renovation packages to make an existing house radiation-proof. “This could be used by construction companies or the government to help their customers and residents,” explains the team leader. With their house, the students want to help the government set standards around radiation. “Not only do we think it’s important to do research and give advice, but we also want to show that it actually works,” he says. “From the university, we can contribute to both elements.” In the coming period, he wants to further develop the house as a not-for-profit student team. “As long as we are connected to the university, we can make use of the facilities, the available knowledge, and the large network. That is very valuable at this stage,” says Varolgunes. “In the future, we may be able to set up a start-up to bring the prefab houses and renovation packages to the market.” Main picture: A model of the radiation-free house. © Team Layer",Minimum wage: bad policy,TRUE
8fba8857,"In a scenario straight out of “The Twilight Zone,” a group of NASA scientists working on an experiment in Antarctica have detected evidence of a parallel universe — where the rules of physics are the opposite of our own, according to a report. The concept of a parallel universe has been around since the early 1960s, mostly in the minds of fans of sci-fi TV shows and comics, but now a cosmic ray detection experiment has found particles that could be from a parallel realm that also was born in the Big Bang, the Daily Star reported. The experts used a giant balloon to carry NASA’s Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna, or ANITA, high above Antarctica, where the frigid, dry air provided the perfect environment with little to no radio noise to distort its findings. A constant “wind” of high-energy particles constantly arrives on Earth from outer space. Low-energy, subatomic neutrinos with a mass close to zero can pass completely through Earth, but higher-energy objects are stopped by the solid matter of our planet, according to the report. ANITA Antarctic Hang TestUniversity of Hawai'i at Manoa; That means the high-energy particles can only be detected coming “down” from space, but the team’s ANITA detected heavier particles, so-called tau neutrinos, which come “up” out of the Earth. The finding implies that these particles are actually traveling backward in time, suggesting evidence of a parallel universe, according to the Daily Star. Principal ANITA investigator Peter Gorham, an experimental particle physicist at the University of Hawaii, suggested that the only way the tau neutrino could behave that way is if it changed into a different type of particle before passing through the Earth and then back again. Gorham, lead author on a Cornell University paper describing the odd phenomenon, noted that he and his fellow researchers had seen several of these “impossible events,” which some were skeptical about. “Not everyone was comfortable with the hypothesis,” he told New Scientist. The simplest explanation for the phenomenon is that at the moment of the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, two universes were formed — ours and one that from our perspective is running in reverse with time going backward. Of course, if there are any inhabitants of a possible parallel universe, they’d consider us the backward ones. “We’re left with the most exciting or most boring possibilities,” said Ibrahim Safa, who also worked on the experiment.",Christian Pastor In Vermont Sentenced To One Year In Prison After Refusing To Marry Gay Couple,FALSE
0765375b,"(Natural News) For more than 60 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has known that the changes occurring to planetary weather patterns are completely natural and normal. But the space agency, for whatever reason, has chosen to let the man-made global warming hoax persist and spread, to the detriment of human freedom. It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth’s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as “warming” (or “cooling,” depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words. But NASA has thus far failed to set the record straight, and has instead chosen to sit silently back and watch as liberals freak out about the world supposedly ending in 12 years because of too much livestock, or too many plastic straws. In the year 2000, NASA did publish information on its Earth Observatory website about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, revealing that the planet is, in fact, changing due to extraneous factors that have absolutely nothing to do with human activity. But, again, this information has yet to go mainstream, some 19 years later, which is why deranged, climate-obsessed leftists have now begun to claim that we really only have 18 months left before the planet dies from an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2). The truth, however, is much more along the lines of what Serbian astrophysicist Milutin Milankovitch, after whom the Milankovitch Climate Theory is named, proposed about how the seasonal and latitudinal variations of solar radiation that hit the earth in different ways, and at different times, have the greatest impact on earth’s changing climate patterns. The below two images (by Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) help to illustrate this, with the first showing earth at a nearly zero orbit, and the second showing earth at a 0.07 orbit. This orbital change is depicted by the eccentric, oval shape in the second image, which has been intentionally exaggerated for the purpose of showing the massive change in distance that occurs between the earth and the sun, depending on whether it is at perihelion or aphelion. “Even the maximum eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit – 0.07 – it would be impossible to show at the resolution of a web page,” notes the Hal Turner Radio Show. “Even so, at the current eccentricity of .017, the Earth is 5 million kilometers closer to Sun at perihelion than at aphelion.” For more related news about climate change and global warming from an independent, non-establishment perspective, be sure to check out ClimateScienceNews.com. The biggest factor affecting earth’s climate is the SUN As for earth’s obliquity, or its change in axial tilt, the below two images (Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) show the degree to which the earth can shift on both its axis and its rotational orientation. At the higher tilts, earth’s seasons become much more extreme, while at lower tilts they become much more mild. A similar situation exists for earth’s rotational axis, which depending on which hemisphere is pointed at the sun during perihelion, can greatly impact the seasonal extremes between the two hemispheres. Based on these different variables, Milankovitch was able to come up with a comprehensive mathematical model that is able to compute surface temperatures on earth going way back in time, and the conclusion is simple: Earth’s climate has always been changing, and is in a constant state of flux due to no fault of our own as human beings. When Milankovitch first put forward his model, it went ignored for nearly half a century. Then, in 1976, a study published in the journal Science confirmed that Milankovitch’s theory is, in fact, accurate, and that it does correspond to various periods of climate change that have occurred throughout history. In 1982, six years after this study was published, the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences adopted Milankovitch’s theory as truth, declaring that: “… orbital variations remain the most thoroughly examined mechanism of climatic change on time scales of tens of thousands of years and are by far the clearest case of a direct effect of changing insolation on the lower atmosphere of Earth.” If we had to sum the whole thing up in one simple phrase, it would be this: The biggest factor influencing weather and climate patterns on earth is the sun, period. Depending on the earth’s position to the sun at any given time, climate conditions are going to vary dramatically, and even create drastic abnormalities that defy everything that humans thought they knew about how the earth worked. But rather than embrace this truth, today’s climate “scientists,” joined by leftist politicians and a complicit mainstream media, insist that not using reusable grocery bags at the supermarket and not having an electric vehicle are destroying the planet so quickly that we absolutely must implement global climate taxes as the solution. “The climate change debate is not about science. It is an effort to impose political and economic controls on the population by the elite,” wrote one commenter at the Hal Turner Radio Show. “And it’s another way to divide the population against itself, with some who believe in man-made global warming and some who don’t, i.e. divide and conquer.” You can read the full Hal Turner Radio Show report at this link.

f353ec98,"More than one in 10 schools have increased the number of unqualified staff who teach lessons to counter growing shortages, a new study has revealed. Almost half 46 per cent of headteachers have reported unfilled positions at their schools, according to a TES Global survey. In an effort to fill these vacancies, 11 per cent of senior leaders are using more unqualified staff, and 26 per cent are using more supply teachers, research suggests. The leadership survey, of nearly 250 headteachers, reveals that schools have also been recruiting teachers from overseas 9 per cent and using teachers to cover subjects in which they do not specialise 16 per cent. According to a new TES Teacher Recruitment Index, based on interviews with nearly 5,000 schools, a physics teacher in London is the hardest position to fill. The second toughest to find is a secondary maths teacher in the the East of England. Schools are struggling to hire new staff in core subjects like maths, English and physics. Last month, TES learned of a secondary willing to pay a head of science a £50,000 salary to fill a vacancy. Schools in London, the South East and West Midlands are facing the biggest challenges with recruitment compared with three years ago, according to the recruitment study. Meanwhile, the North East, North West and South West are finding it easier to recruit teachers. Vic Goddard, principal at Passmores Academy in Harlow and star of TV show Educating Essex, said: “This is a challenge all over the country. Our proximity to London means that we are having to work incredibly hard to recruit teachers for shortage subjects, normally with very little success. “I am having to think very creatively about how to attract good quality teaching talent for subjects like maths, whether that’s looking overseas or even looking at how we can give teachers somewhere to live to get them to join us.” Rob Grimshaw, CEO of TES Global, said: “While we may not be facing a national crisis in teacher recruitment, it will certainly feel like it in some areas. Schools are having to become increasingly creative to find the talent they need. “The TES Recruitment Index shows recruitment challenges facing schools across England in unprecedented detail. By sharing this data we hope to support a collective and targeted response to difficulties with teacher recruitment in specific subjects and regions.” Responding to the index, a Department for Education spokesperson said: “The number and quality of teachers in our classrooms is at an all-time high. New figures show we have recruited more trainees than last year and the number of former teachers coming back to the classroom has continued to rise year after year - from 14,720 in 2011 to 17,350 in 2014. “The National Teaching Service will recruit 1500 outstanding teachers and school leaders to work in underperforming schools in challenging areas. We are expanding Teach First into every region of the country and the School Direct programme offers all schools - regardless of location - the chance to take control and develop high quality staff and future leaders. Our new range of generous bursaries – up to £30,000 in subjects such as physics - will ensure we continue to attract the best and the brightest.” For more in-depth analysis and coverage of the recruitment crisis, visit our feature here free to subsribers.

cef0a3d1,"Occupation: President and CEO, Bettencourt Tax Advisors L.L.C. Legislative Experience: Senate Member: 2015 - present Party: Republican First elected to the Senate in 2014, Senator Paul Bettencourt represents Senate District 7, which encompasses most of West Harris County. He previously served 10 years, from 1998 - 2008, as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector, where he introduced “Smart Government” at the Harris County Tax Office and developed a customer service-driven organization. His team created the first major county online property tax payment system and the first county tax office website with online vehicle registration in Texas. (His motto was “Get on-line, not in-line.”) He was well-known as the “Tax Man” for his outspoken efforts to cut property taxes. In the most recent Legislative Session, Senator Bettencourt successfully passed Senate Bill 2, the Texas Property Tax Reform and Transparency Act of 2019, by a vote of 21-9 to bring meaningful property tax reform and relief to all Texas taxpayers. This was the first major property tax reform legislation in almost 40 years, and the culmination of two decades of advocacy. He also continued his work on adult stem cell therapies in Texas by sponsoring HB 3148, building upon previous legislative sessions to get government out of the way, allowing new therapies to flourish and give terminally and chronically ill patients hope for a better quality of life. His work during the 86th Session earned him the distinction of ""Senate MVP"" by Capitol Inside, ""Bull of the Brazos"" by Texas Monthly, the Legislative Legacy Award by Texas Public Policy Foundation and he was given the ""Citizen's Choice Award"" by Empower Texans. A champion for conservative solutions to Texas' challenges, Senator Bettencourt has built a strong reputation at the Capitol advocating for taxpayers. In his previous legislative sessions he worked tirelessly to pass conservative budgets, enact a supermajority requirement within a taxing jurisdiction to raise taxes, (which prevented a $100,000,000 tax increase in its first year) as well as author SB 7 which sought to stamp out the growing plague of inappropriate student-educator relationships. A compassionate conservative, Senator Bettencourt has been a leader on ""Right to Try"" and adult stem cell legislation, fighting for terminally and chronically ill patients across Texas to have better access to treatments and new therapies. Legislation that he sponsored on this important issue was adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a national model other states could follow. He has also greatly expanded dual credit opportunities (SB 1004) for Texas students and Joint-Authored bipartisan legislation to enhance educational opportunities for students through ISD/Charter partnerships (SB 1882). Numerous organizations have acknowledged Senator Bettencourt for his work in the Texas Senate. In his first session, Capitol Inside named him ""Most Valuable Freshman"" and Vision America named him their ""Outstanding Texas Legislator."" He has also been named “Taxpayer Advocate of the Year” by the Americans for Prosperity, Previously as an elected official he was named a “Hero of Faith” by the Houston Area Pastors’ Council, and earned the “Pioneer Award” from the Harris County Republican Party. Senator Bettencourt is the Chair of the Senate Committee on Local Government and serves on the Senate Finance, Education, and Criminal Justice committees. He has also been named to the Redistricting Committee by Lt. Governor Patrick. He also served as the Chair of the Senate Republican Caucus from January 2016 to February 2021. A Bachelor of Science graduate of Texas A&M University in Industrial Distribution, Senator Bettencourt is the President and CEO of a tax consulting company in Houston that has grown to forty employees. He is also a radio and television personality. The Senator and his wife Susan are active members of Saint John Vianney Catholic Church, where Paul is a fourth degree Knight of Columbus.

The study found that between March and December 2020, face mask orders reduced infection rates by 1.5 percent over the rolling periods of two months each. The masks were 0.5 percent effective in the first 20 days of the mandates and less than 2 percent effective after 100 days. The CDC added it still recommends wearing face masks, although it admitted such mandates do not make any statistical difference. In the meantime, some states across the nation have slowly returned to normalcy by putting an end to mask mandates. ",TRUE
81ea2def,"In the scramble to make sense of the post-inauguration world, Amazon has been forced to restock a few key titles: Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four hit No 1 at the end of last week, after Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway used the phrase “alternative facts” in place of “some bullshit I just made up”. But the surprise hit – being long, complex and demanding or, as the online magazine Jezebel described it, “extremely metal” – is Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, first published in 1951. Commentators have been referencing the work since Donald Trump’s election in November but rarely has this spurred so many people to actually buy a copy. In it, the political theorist (she always explicitly rejected the term “philosopher”) details the trajectory: “antisemitism (not merely hatred of Jews), imperialism (not merely conquest), totalitarianism (not merely dictatorship)” are considered in their interrelation. Against the necessary background of imperialism, “antisemitism became the catalytic agent first for the rise of the Nazi movement … then for a world war of unparalleled ferocity and, finally, for the emergence of the unprecedented crime of genocide”. That much is well established; the chill is in the detail. When she describes the rise of the dictator, which requires a mass not a mob, you could be reading a sociologist’s thesis about Trump supporters. “The term masses applies only where we deal with people who either because of sheer numbers, or indifference, or a combination of both, cannot be integrated into any organisation based on common interest, into political parties or municipal governments or professional organisations or trade unions. Potentially, they exist in every country and form the majority of those large numbers of neutral, politically indifferent people who never join a party and hardly ever go to the polls.” She describes, quite brusquely, antisemitism at its incipience: “Whereas anti-Jewish sentiments were widespread among the educated classes of Europe throughout the 19th century, antisemitism as an ideology remained, with very few exceptions, the prerogative of crackpots in general and the lunatic fringes in particular.” Yet however you dismissed their mental capacity, this hardcore created the ideological infrastructure on which a mass movement could be built. It is strikingly reminiscent of John Naughton’s description on David Runciman’s interesting Talking Politics podcast about the “alt-right”: “People who belonged loosely to this side of the political system were essentially excluded from public discourse. But it just so happened, they didn’t go quiet. They went to the net. So, for the best part of 20 years, a network of rightwing echo chambers has been established, upon which was built the infrastructure of Trump’s campaign.” Demonstrators on Washington’s Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women’s March in January. Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images Two points come out of that. First, that we can see from the comparison that the net isn’t responsible for everything. Antisemites found ways to keep their ideas alive and generative without any such advantage, and with all the same forces of conservatism and common sense ranged against them. Second, as Runciman asks, what happened to the leftwing networks? Why don’t we have effective echo chambers? It is a question that all of us have been asking, one way or another; there is no shortage of radicalism on the left. Here, Arendt brings some liberating insight, described in precis by Professor Griselda Pollock, an expert in Arendt. “She talks of the creation of pan movements, these widespread ideas that overarch national, political and ethnic elements – the two big pan movements she talks about are bolshevism and nazism. There is a single explanation for everything, and before the single explanation, everything else falls away. She gives a portrait of how you produce these isolated people, who then become susceptible to pan ideologies, which give them a place in something. But the place they have is ultimately sacrificial; they don’t count for anything; all that counts is the big idea.” The left, in other words, isn’t necessarily unequal to the task of creating a pan-ideology; but anyone who believed in pluralism or complexity would have no currency on this terrain. We should be glad not to have been effective in this space, even if it feels like a failure. Arendt was born in Germany in 1906 and was an academic until 1933, when she embarked on charity work, securing passage to Palestine for Jewish children and teenagers. The decision was not based on any sudden realisation of Hitler’s menace. “For goodness sake,” she said, laughing, in a television interview in 1964, “we didn’t need [him] to know that the Nazis were our enemies. We also knew that a large number of Germans were behind him. That could not shock us in 1933.” Rather, she had been alienated from the intellectual milieu by their “coordinated” exclusion of their Jewish colleagues (Arendt came from a family of secular Jewish lefties). “The personal problem did not lie in what our enemies did but in what our friends did,” she said. “[They were] not yet under the pressure of terror, [but] it was as if a vacuum formed around one.” She conducted the refugee work from Paris. Stripped of her German citizenship in 1937, she escaped to New York in 1941 with her husband and mother, via the Gurs internment camp in the Vichy-held south of France. She was never unclear about the magnitude of the Holocaust, saying, in the same interview: “The decisive day was when we heard about Auschwitz. Before that, we said: ‘Well, one has enemies. That is natural. Why shouldn’t people have enemies?’ But this was different. It was as if an abyss had opened. Amends can be made for almost anything, at some point in politics, but not for this.” Arendt in New York in 1972. Photograph: New York Times Co/Getty Images However, she was a controversial figure by the 1960s, following the publication of Eichmann in Jerusalem, a consideration of Adolf Eichmann’s trial and what it revealed about the nature of the Final Solution and all those who were complicit in it. Opponents accused her of making the Jews complicit in their fate. She rejected that outright – “Nowhere in this book did I accuse the Jews of failing to resist” – but said, “that the tone is predominantly ironic is completely true. [Reading Eichmann’s trial] I laughed countless times, I laughed out loud. I’d probably still laugh three minutes before my certain death.” This is the book that coined the phrase “banality of evil”, which has ramifications for both totalitarianism as a project and the pathways of resistance. But it is also a useful thumbnail of the primacy of language to her understanding of politics; cliches in the service of control, their mundanity, their mendacity, cannot but amuse her. There is also the matter of Martin Heidegger, the philosopher with whom she had a turbulent relationship in the 20s, and some other contact – its extent unclear – after the war, despite his links with the Nazi party, even justifying them (it reads like the darkest imaginable romcom – “But I love him! But he’s a Nazi. But I love him!”). Pollock guards against drawing too many of the obvious parallels between The Origins of Totalitarianism and the US’s situation today: “Islamophobia is not elaborated with the same complexity of tropes and myths as antisemitism and one shouldn’t equate them.” The work of Arendt’s that she refers to most often is the one that came directly after Origins, 1958’s The Human Condition. In the Holocaust, “we have seen the abolition of the human,” Pollock explains, “and then she has to write what would actually be an account of the human as a political creature”. Arendt has two core beliefs about the human condition (not to be confused with human nature). First, Pollock explains: “Every human life is the potential beginning of something new. Unlike animals, which are predictable – each will behave as its parents behaved – something has begun in a human that could be completely different. This is ‘natality’. As a result of that, the human condition is plural.” The consequences of this are vast: as we communicate and use language, we show ourselves to one another in our difference, and it’s in this disclosure that action is generated: we can do something to change the world. Then comes a really important dichotomy, taking its roots from Greek philosophy: the difference between this action and labour, which is what we do to survive. Work is the economic, “which comes from the Greek word oikos, which is the household. But they imagined this other source, the political, the source of speech and action.” This is what constituted, for the Greeks, the human, and through Arendt’s prism, natality and plurality are the spurs of that political self; that is, the political recognises the infinite potential of each human life, while the economic recognises only that element of the human that works, that produces. As Pollock says: “What she was afraid of was the tendency to devalue action, for the economic to overtake the political.” Taken to its logical end, the economic overtaking the political results not in the extermination camp but in the concentration camp; the difference is crucial, Pollock explains. The concentration camp exists not to extinguish life but to extinguish the human. “You are removed from moral action, you become a number and, finally, you are reduced physiologically to a bundle of reactions, as the body struggles to survive extreme emaciation.” If politics is only a set of economic decisions, then the person is no more than the work they do and the infinite preciousness of every person’s potential cascades into a brutal homogeneity, one person indivisible from the next. To put this in a modern context, “official political reality is now being enacted by the modern capitalist businessman”. Politics and economics are, in Trump, indivisible. “And although it looks wonderful that people are demonstrating, it’s actually rather frightening, because it’s generating a crisis situation in which, ultimately, the protection of law and order justifies the government in extreme measures. For some of us, it’s repeating the proto-fascist scenario.” It’s an old Leninist stunt, the generation of civil unrest in order to attack civic society. In that sense, we are all playing into Trump’s tiny hands. Mark Davis, director of the Bauman Institute in Leeds, points us towards another text, On Violence (1970). “I think that gets us closer to what’s going on at the moment,” he says. “She said in that book that violence and power are actually opposites. When institutions, particularly those of government, start to break down and lose their legitimacy, they lose their power over the everyday conduct of citizens. So what they do as a response to the loss of power is incite violence. Violence floods in to the loss of power rather than being an expression of it.” A placard at the demonstration at Downing Street in January. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images Pollock brings us back to demonstrations and what they do to language, the slogan being a flattening out of complexity, an echo of exactly the same one-idea pan-ideology of the oversimplified worldview they protest against. I’m not sure. You can pack quite a lot into a slogan – I particularly like: “First they came for the Muslims, and we said, not today, motherfucker.” Yet I see the sense of these arguments, and wonder, what would Hannah Arendt do? Would she have marched on Downing Street? Davis is conflicted. “Certainly, I think there is a lot to be gained from people gathering together to show solidarity. But in a world where the institutions that we’re protesting in front of are losing their legitimacy and their power, I’m not sure that this has the impact that it once did. If we think of evil as this one person, this one big event, then we tend to want to match that with one big display of resistance. But actually, if evil is banal – a set of ordinary, mundane decisions day by day – then maybe we have to start living differently day by day.” I still see the point in protesting as a concrete expression of solidarity. I’d take more, if under attack, from a person who went outside than a person who signed a petition. Tangentially, I have a sudden new faith in the feminist framing of recent demonstrations as women’s marches, which does something to allay the intimation of public violence that is always used as the justification of suppression. It seems clear, nonetheless, that it isn’t enough: that perhaps Arendt’s most profound legacy is in establishing that one has to consider oneself political as part of the human condition.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Almost 600 homeless people have died in England and Wales in a single year, shocking figures reveal. An estimated 597 homeless people died in 2017, a rise of 24% over the last five years. Today's Office for National Statistics figures were released less than 36 hours after a homeless man was found dying outside Parliament. Days before Christmas the man - named by friends as Gyula Remes - was found in an underpass next to Westminster Tube station and died later in hospital. He was the second homeless man known to have died near the Palace of Westminster this year On Thursday the Speaker of the House of Commons also expressed his sadness at the death. He said: May I express my sadness on behalf of the whole house at the death yesterday in the subway. They mostly cover people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation at or around the time of death. Image: Facebook Today's statistics, the first official figures detailing the number of people who have died while homeless estimate 482 homeless people died in 2013; 475 in 2014; 508 in 2015; 565 in 2016; and 597 in 2017. Leading homeless charity Crisis called the situation a national tragedy. Chief Executive, Jon Sparkes, said: “ It’s shocking to think that hundreds of people faced the last days of their lives without the dignity of a secure roof over their head. This is nothing short of a national tragedy - especially when we know that homelessness is not inevitable. He added: “Behind these statistics are human beings – mothers, fathers, daughters and sons – whose families will now be spending Christmas coming to terms with their loss. This has to change. Governments must urgently expand the system used to investigate the deaths of vulnerable adults to include all those who have died while street homeless, so that crucial lessons can be learned to help prevent more people from dying needlessly. We must also recognise that many people who are homeless have complex needs that have either led to their homelessness, or developed because of it. It’s crucial that there are services in place to support people in these vulnerable circumstances, before it’s too late. Almost all of last year's homeless deaths were men, at 84%. Homeless men died on average at the age of 44 and women at 42 in that period, compared to 76 and 81 for the general population. Homeless deaths in England and Wales ONS London and the North West of England had the highest mortality rates. London was the worst hit last year with more than a fifth of the estimated deaths, at 136, while the North West had 119. But over that period the estimated death toll in London remained largely stable, whereas the North West saw a jump of 115% from 55. Estimates for the North East also saw a 71% increase, from 18 to 32. It was estimated that last year more than one in 10 homeless deaths were due to suicide, while more than two-fifths was due to drug poisoning or alcohol-related. Melanie Onn MP, Labour’s Shadow Housing Minister, said: “These figures are utterly shameful and reflect a complete failure of Conservative policy on housing, which has seen rough sleeping skyrocket since 2010. “We are one of the richest countries in the world and there is no excuse for people dying on our streets. “Labour will provide £100m to ensure that everyone has shelter when it becomes dangerously cold. We will end rough sleeping within five years to ensure that everyone has a place to call home.” Housing Secretary James Brokenshire described the figures as stark. Answering an urgent question he told the House of Commons: Every death of someone sleeping rough on our streets is one too many. He added: No one chooses to be on the street - no one chooses that life. Theresa May's spokesman said: “These figures are clearly very concerning. “Every death on our streets is one too many and it's unacceptable to see lives cut short this way. “We are determined to help the most vulnerable in society – that's why we are investing £1.2billion to tackle homelessness, and on taking action to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it altogether by 2027.” Asked what the PM thought was behind the rise, her spokesman said: “These are complex issues but what's important is that we are working hard to address this with partners.” Asked about the death on Parliament's doorstep, he added: “There is an investigation which has begun into that but obviously our sympathies go to his family and his friends and all those who knew him.” Asked if the PM “feels a sense of shame” because the man had been sleeping rough outside Parliament, her spokesman said: “The PM's thoughts are with all those who knew the guy, and it's very tragic.”",,TRUE

One senior Labour figure – a veteran of Tony Blair's Downing Street administration with strong links to Washington – claimed to The Mail on Sunday that Ms Markle, 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency. Last night, a source close to the Duchess of Sussex declined to comment, but the couple have made little secret of their political beliefs. One senior Labour figure claimed that Meghan Markle (pictured last year), 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency During the US election last year they levelled a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump by urging voters to 'reject hate speech', which a spokesperson for the couple described as 'a call for decency'. Trump himself declared that he was 'not a fan' of Meghan, 39. A source said: 'The Blairite, internationalist and Democratic party networks are buzzing with talk about Meghan's political ambitions and potential backers.' Last year, a friend of the Duchess told Vanity Fair magazine that one of the reasons she did not give up her American citizenship when she married into the Royal Family was to allow her to keep open the option of entering Washington politics. US constitutional experts responded that she would have to renounce her title if she wanted to hold public office in the States, because it would cut across the US oath of allegiance. Buckingham Palace tried to distance the Royal Family from the remarks made during the US election by issuing a statement saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the Royal Family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'. The source added that the presumption was that the Duchess was eyeing 2024, when President Joe Biden will be 82 and deciding whether he wants to run for a second term. During the US election last year the couple levelled a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump by urging voters to 'reject hate speech' If she made it to the White House, Meghan would be the first female US President – succeeding where Hillary Clinton narrowly failed four years ago If she made it to the White House, Meghan would be the first female US President – succeeding where Hillary Clinton narrowly failed four years ago – and the second non-white occupant of the Oval Office after Barack Obama.

During the 2020 campaign, the Duchess addressed the When All Women Vote Couch Party, the organisation co-founded by Michelle Obama to encourage participation in elections.

86955ba5,"In my experience, good public policy is best shaped by the dispassionate analysis of what in practice has worked, or not. Policy based on common assumptions and popular sentiments can become a recipe for mistaken prescriptions and misguided interventions. Nowhere is this divorce between rhetoric and reality more evident than in the formulation of global drug policies, where too often emotions and ideology rather than evidence have prevailed. Take the case of the medical use of cannabis. By looking carefully at the evidence from the United States, we now know that legalizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes has not, as opponents argued, led to an increase in its use by teenagers. By contrast, there has been a near tripling of American deaths from heroin overdoses between 2010 and 2013, even though the law and its severe punishments remain unchanged. This year, between April 19 and 21, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on drugs and the world will have a chance to change course. As we approach that event, we need to ask ourselves if we are on the right policy path. More specifically, how do we deal with what the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has called the ""unintended consequences"" of the policies of the last 50 years, which have helped, among other things, to create a vast, international criminal market in drugs that fuels violence, corruption and instability? Just think of the 16,000 murders in Mexico in 2013, many of which are directly linked to drug trafficking. A War on the People Globally, the ""war on drugs"" has not succeeded. Some estimate that enforcing global prohibition costs at least $100 billion (€90.7 billion) a year, but as many as 300 million people now use drugs worldwide, contributing to a global illicit market with a turnover of $330 billion a year, one of the largest commodity markets in the world. Prohibition has had little impact on the supply of or demand for drugs. When law enforcement succeeds in one area, drug production simply moves to another region or country, drug trafficking moves to another route and drug users switch to a different drug. Nor has prohibition significantly reduced use. Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country's drug laws and its levels of drug use. The widespread criminalization and punishment of people who use drugs, the over­crowded prisons, mean that the war on drugs is, to a significant degree, a war on drug users ­­ a war on people. Africa is sadly an example of these problems. The West Africa Commission on Drugs, which my foundation convened, reported last year that the region has now become not only a major transit point between producers in Latin America and consumers in Europe, but an area where consumption is increasing. Drug money, and the criminality associated with it, is fostering corruption and violence. The stability of countries and the region as a whole is under threat. I believe that drugs have destroyed many lives, but wrong government policies have destroyed many more. We all want to protect our families from the potential harm of drugs. But if our children do develop a drug problem, surely we will want them cared for as patients in need of treatment and not branded as criminals. Stop Stigmatizing and Start Helping The tendency in many parts of the world to stigmatize and incarcerate drug users has prevented many from seeking medical treatment. In what other areas of public health do we criminalize patients in need of help? Punitive measures have sent many people to prison, where their drug use has worsened. A criminal record for a young person for a minor drug offense can be a far greater threat to their wellbeing than occasional drug use. The original intent of drug policy, according to the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs, was to protect the ""health and welfare of mankind."" We need to refocus international and national policy on this key objective. This requires us to take four critical steps. First, we must decriminalize personal drug use. The use of drugs is harmful and reducing those harms is a task for the public health system, not the courts. This must be coupled with the strengthening of treatment services, especially in middle and low­ income countries. Second, we need to accept that a drug­-free world is an illusion. We must focus instead on ensuring that drugs cause the least possible harm. Harm reduction measures, such as needle exchange programs, can make a real difference. Germany adopted such measures early on and the level of HIV infections among injecting drug users is close to 5 percent, compared to over 40 percent in some countries which resist this pragmatic approach. Third, we have to look at regulation and public education rather than the total suppression of drugs, which we know will not work. The steps taken successfully to reduce tobacco consumption (a very powerful and damaging addiction) show what can be achieved. It is regulation and education, not the threat of prison, which has cut the number of smokers in many countries. Higher taxes, restrictions on sale and effective anti­-smoking campaigns have delivered the right results. The legal sale of cannabis is a reality that started with California legalizing the sale of cannabis for medical use in 1996. Since then, 22 U.S. states and some European countries have followed suit. Others have gone further still. A voter initiative which gained a majority at the ballot box has caused Colorado to legalize the sale of cannabis for recreational use. Last year, Colorado collected around $135 million in taxes and license fees related to legal cannabis sales. Others have taken less commercial routes. Users of Spain's cannabis social clubs can grow and buy cannabis through small noncommercial organizations. And Canada looks likely to become the first G7 country to regulate the sale of cannabis next year. Legal Regulation Protects Health Initial trends show us that where cannabis has been legalized, there has been no explosion in drug use or drug­ related crime. The size of the black market has been reduced and thousands of young people have been spared criminal records. But a regulated market is not a free market. We need to carefully think through what needs regulating, and what does not. While most cannabis use is occasional, moderate and not associated with significant problems, it is nonetheless precisely because of its potential risks that it needs to be regulated. And therefore, the fourth and final step is to recognize that drugs must be regulated precisely because they are risky. It is time to acknowledge that drugs are infinitely more dangerous if they are left solely in the hands of criminals who have no concerns about health and safety. Legal regulation protects health. Consumers need to be aware of what they are taking and have clear information on health risks and how to minimize them. Governments need to be able to regulate vendors and outlets according to how much harm a drug can cause. The most risky drugs should never be available ""over the counter"" but only via medical prescription for people registered as dependent users, as is already happening in Switzerland. Scientific evidence and our concern for health and human rights must shape drug policy. This means making sure that fewer people die from drug overdoses and that small-­time offenders do not end up in jail where their drug problems get worse. It is time for a smarter, health­-based approach to drug policy. It is time for countries, such as Germany, which have adopted better policies at home, to strongly advocate for policy change abroad.

2695016,"He did none of those things. I’ve reviewed all of his public statements and actions on coronavirus over the last two months, and they show a president who put almost no priority on public health. Trump’s priorities were different: Making the virus sound like a minor nuisance. Exaggerating his administration’s response. Blaming foreigners and, anachronistically, the Obama administration. Claiming incorrectly that the situation was improving. Trying to cheer up stock market investors. (It was fitting that his first public comments were from Davos and on CNBC.) Now that the severity of the virus is undeniable, Trump is already trying to present an alternate history of the last two months. Below are the facts — a timeline of what the president was saying, alongside statements from public-health experts as well as data on the virus. Late January On the same day that Trump was dismissing the risks on CNBC, Tom Frieden, who ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for eight years, wrote an op-ed for the health care publication Stat. In it, Frieden warned that the virus would continue spreading. “We need to learn — and fast — about how it spreads,” he wrote. It was one of many such warnings from prominent experts in late January. Many focused on the need to expand the capacity to test for the virus. In a Wall Street Journal article titled, “Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic,” Luciana Borio and Scott Gottlieb — both former Trump administration officials — wrote: If public-health authorities don’t interrupt the spread soon, the virus could infect many thousands more around the globe, disrupt air travel, overwhelm health care systems, and, worst of all, claim more lives. The good news: There’s still an opening to prevent a grim outcome. … But authorities can’t act quickly without a test that can diagnose the condition rapidly. Trump, however, repeatedly told Americans that there was no reason to worry. On Jan. 24, he tweeted, “It will all work out well.” On Jan. 28, he retweeted a headline from One America News, an outlet with a history of spreading false conspiracy theories: “Johnson & Johnson to create coronavirus vaccine.” On Jan. 30, during a speech in Michigan, he said: “We have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully.” That same day, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus to be a “public-health emergency of international concern.” It announced 7,818 confirmed cases around the world.",Getting on with the job this week — Scottish National Party,TRUE

The red-and-white caps are emblazoned with the real estate mogul’s oft-repeated slogan, “Make America Great Again.” But look around the factory floor where these hats are being made by the thousands, and you’ll find faces that don’t seem to fit into Trump’s America. Yolanda Melendrez is one of them. Melendrez, an immigrant from Mexico who was brought to the United States by her parents when she was a baby, has worked at the Carson-based Cali-Fame headwear company since 1991. TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >> “When we first got the order [for the Trump hats], I said to myself, ‘Just wait until he sees who’s making his hats.

She now works as a lead on the floor, roaming as she checks on the flow of work, supervising other sewing machine operators and embroiders. She became a citizen when she was 20; her parents are permanent residents. Melendrez was 14 when she had her first child, and the job has helped her pay rent and put food on the table for her kids, she says. Workers stitch together hats on the factory floor of Cali-Fame in Carson. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) One recent Saturday at the Cali-Fame factory, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, dozens of employees, almost all of them Latino, were working away while machines whirred all around them. Some peered over glasses as their deft hands assembled one hat after another; others swept scraps of fabric from the floor. They were surrounded by stacks of freshly minted camouflage-print caps, with the presidential hopeful’s all-capital-letter promise emblazoned on the front in orange. Advertisement Brian Kennedy, president of Cali-Fame, says that when the Trump campaign asked his family business to make the now-famous hats, he knew he would need to address his workers. “I said to them, ‘We’re not political. We’re here to work,’” Kennedy told the Los Angeles Times from the second floor of his factory, the steady sound of sewing machines in action below him. “And I haven’t gotten any negative comments.” The hats, known best in the signature red with white font, have inspired hipster fashion trends, Halloween costumes, a make-your-own-Trump-hat generator and even a short-lived rumor they actually were made in China. (They weren’t, Kennedy assures). In fact, unlike some Trump-branded lines of clothing sold nationally, this headwear is legitimately made in the USA, creating jobs for people who hail from the very places Trump has at times disparaged. The company employs about 100 people in a 30,000-square-foot warehouse. About 80% of the company’s workforce is Latino, Kennedy estimates. He says that every worker has his or her immigration status verified. The “Make America Great Again” hats have been a boon to Kennedy’s business, which pulled in more than $270,000 from the Trump campaign last quarter, according to campaign finance records. The merchandise was a portion of the more than $825,000 the Trump campaign dropped on bumper stickers, T-shirts, hats and other promotional gear, the largest category of Trump’s spending outside of travel. The hats have seemingly been a boon for Trump’s campaign too. Most of the caps sell for $25 each and appear to have boosted the billionaire’s small donations column, making donors of those who purchase them, ironically or not. SIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >> Kennedy and his brother, Tim, Cali-Fame’s vice president of sales, have been reluctant to wade into the political fray. Brian Kennedy, who initially declined to be interviewed, says he’s turned down dozens of media requests. Advertisement A visit to the factory on a weekday suggests the business might have easily remained anonymous, save for campaign finance records: The windows were black and no signs of life were obvious early one evening, except for a few modestly appointed cars in the parking lot. Kennedy and his brother bristled at the news coverage they received for weeks after campaign finance disclosures were released. Melendrez says she tries her best to avoid it too. She says she’s heard some of the things Trump has said about Mexican immigrants and Latinos like her, but she attempts to ignore them, even as headlines about Trump’s proposals to build an impenetrable wall on the border of Mexico and his comments writing off some Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals continue to dominate coverage of the Republican front-runner’s campaign. Advertisement When Macy’s cut ties with Trump over his remarks, which the company said were “inconsistent with Macy’s values,” Trump publicly accused the retailer of supporting illegal immigration. “A lot of what he says about Latinos is not correct,” Melendrez says with a shrug just as a buzzer signals the end of her Saturday overtime shift and workers line up to clock out. Spanish punctuates the air as the machines sputter to a stop. But Melendrez doesn’t pay the media reports much mind. She knows she has a job to do. “You know,” she says, “he’s giving us a lot of work. Keeping us busy.… It’s a job, I get paid to do it and it pays my bills.” And for that, Melendrez says, she’s thankful. Brian Kennedy is president of Cali-Fame. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. Although Kennedy downplayed the role Trump’s orders have played for his business as the holiday season begins, several employees said this is the busiest November they’ve seen in years, with plenty of overtime work to go around. Kennedy says that since his father bought the business in 1977, Cali-Fame has weathered rising labor costs, employee downsizing, changing technologies and cutthroat competition from cheap overseas labor. Advertisement The factory is on the edge of an industrial district that presses up against tight rows of neatly fenced single-story homes. On the other side of the 710 Freeway and across the L.A. River is a country club and golf course serving Long Beach’s nearby tony neighborhoods. “To be a local manufacturer in the United States, there’s so many challenges, not only in America but in California alone,” he says while surveying the massive warehouse. For decades, the company had its bread and butter in golf tournament caps and other promotional headwear. The company has taken in other work, Kennedy says, such as embroidering ready-made shirts and sweatshirts, to help boost revenue. More recently, the manufacturer has branched out into street wear and urban fashion, launching a brand that has focused on supporting burgeoning clothing companies. Wood panels separate a portion of the warehouse for a showroom of sorts, allowing Cali-Fame to host an occasional sale. On a recent weekend, curious deal-seekers browsed straw fedoras and baseball caps of varying designs, but no Trump hats were in sight. “The old cliche is that you roll with the punches,” Tim Kennedy says. “We’ve done that many times, and we’re constantly changing what we do and how we do things.” But it’s been increasingly difficult to stay competitive, the Kennedy brothers say. Rising healthcare costs, the possibility of a $15 minimum wage countywide and workers’ compensation laws have been a “juggling act” to keep up with, they say. Brian Kennedy says his company has been making hats for Trump’s golf courses for about a decade, which is how he got connected with the campaign. These caps -- “the five-panel trucker hat with cord,” Kennedy will tell you -- have become a solid front-runner when it comes to 2016 campaign kitsch. “It’s a classic,” says Tim Kennedy. “Everything comes full circle in the fashion business. It’s straight from Middle America to New York and Los Angeles.” Advertisement For more on politics in the Golden State, follow me @cmaiduc. For more, go to www.latimes.com/politics.

36a280c7,"The South Pole, the most isolated part of the planet, is also one of the most rapidly warming ones, scientists said Monday, with surface air temperatures rising since the 1990s at a rate that is three times faster than the global average. While the warming could be the result of natural climate change alone, the researchers said, it is likely that the effects of human-caused warming contributed to it. The pole, home to a United States research base in the high, icy emptiness of the Antarctic interior, warmed by about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade over the past 30 years, the researchers reported in a paper published in Nature Climate Change. The global average over that time was about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. Although parts of coastal Antarctica are losing ice, which contributes to sea level rise, the pole is in no danger of melting, as the year-round average temperature is still about minus-50 degrees Celsius. But the finding shows that no place is unaffected by change on a warming planet.","Belgian government Minister Fremault announced that Brussels is halting their 5G plans due to the negative health effects. Celine Fremault, Minister of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region Responsible For Housing, Quality Of Life, Environment And Energy released the statement in an interview with L’Echo: “I cannot welcome such technology if the radiation standards, which must protect the citizen, are not respected, 5G or not. The people of Brussels are not guinea pigs whose health I can sell at a profit. We cannot leave anything to doubt."" Minister Fremault accurately identified that the 5G pilot project will not be compatible with Belgian radiation safety standards of 9 V/m, or 95 mW/m2, and has stated that she will not be making an exception. In the guidelines the threshold for extreme concern is 1 mW/m2, however many government agencies still only consider thermal effects and profit rather than the cumulative body of the thousands of peer reviewed scientific studies. With Brussels heading up the EU, and with one of the 2 major 5G appeals being addressed to the EU officials officials they seem to be better informed and motivated to protect themselves in the EU. Hopefully support continues to build for Minister Celine Fremault and all officials who are hearing the call to sanity and plea of the people to prioritize their safety over the technocratic oligarchy. Perhaps officials in North America and elsewhere should take note and follow suit, after all that motivating profit will soon stop once more people get sick and can no longer spend money.

This alone should be enough to delete the granting of the unheard of powers to the greedy soulless corporate algorithms, this entire situation should be filed under an attempt of useful technology gone bad for profit and control. The question that should be really be asked by everyone is does 5G pose a threat to all biological life? It hasn’t been fully tested, and the results of independent evidence is overwhelmingly suggesting that yes 5G dose pose a major threat. That is unless you ask the telecommunications networks and the agencies and officials within their deep pockets who release untruths, withhold information, and attempt to quash pushback. In a US senate hearing the wireless industry even brashly admitted they have not done any safety studies and don’t plan to. Hundreds of scientists are trying to sound the alarm and raise the red flags. Dr. Martin Pall has conducted research that has laid out the mechanisms of how wireless radiation causes harm in our cells, and calls 5G “the stupidest idea in the history of the world.” Unfortunately those deep pockets of the telecommunications giants run deep and wide, within corporatized halls of government full of lobbyists that drown out the voice of reason with dreams of grandeur, control and greed for the unprecedented economic opportunities of the full on commercial exploitation of reality for even more profit and deprivation among these agenda pushers stuck in hive mind states blinded by the control and dollar signs obsessions, who are at the very least incapable of seeing where all this is heading and what will happen to them, their families, and all life on Earth. All of the industry and its sheepeople are being presented with scientific evidence of this catastrophe in the making, and being asked to wait for testing before forcing 5G upon the world. Yet they are refusing to listen and continue towing their control and profit pushing line. Why is this being allowed, how can it be ignored unless they have a dark agenda that includes a shadow of expression for an utter disdain for life. Perhaps even at the core of this desire lays an agenda to exit the human condition via AI and transhumanism seeking escape through technology rather than humanity and connection with divinity. Why else would this be pushed for so hard, untested, at all costs, ignoring the plea of science, it does make one wonder. To any sane person with normal values this 5G situation is to say the least bewildering and alarming. Perhaps with current connectedness we can help other become aware and work together to find a solution and choice for a positive future and push back against 5G.

c16c32a8,"Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility. As he said in 2007, “It’s not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.” Look at American history, Gingrich continued, “The government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.” This was not one of Gingrich’s passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, “Window of Opportunity,” is a broadside against what he calls the “laissez-faire” conservatism — the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, “The opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.”",Is Meghan Markle already preparing a bid to be America's first woman President?,TRUE

NHS figures show 43 per cent of health boards provide no specialised maternity service, and in those areas that do have a service, only a third meet the recommended standards An estimated 140,000 women giving birth each year are thought to suffer depression, anxiety or other mental health problems during pregnancy or in the months after birth. Thousands never get the support they need, and suicide is a leading cause of death in expectant and new mothers. After years of insufficient funding, NHS England has finally agreed to act, pledging £365million over the next five years. Officials today launch a £5million development fund for health boards to tackle the problem, which they hope will treat 30,000 new or expectant mothers a year. Experts have long warned that post-natal depression had gone ignored. Yet the cost of treating the problem is minimal, adding an estimated £83 to the £2,800 average cost of maternity care. Left untreated, however, the cost rises to an average of £10,000 per woman. Vicki Nash, of mental health charity Mind, welcomed the new funding, but added: ‘Too many simply don’t get the right support in these vital months. This can lead to catastrophic consequences. ‘It is vitally important now that NHS England and clinical commissioning groups take this opportunity to work together and ensure that this money gets to the frontline fast.’ Consultant psychiatrist Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, said: ‘In many parts of the country there are no services at all, not even someone who can give some advice.

Over the next few months I became obsessed with it, and then I turned against myself. ‘I became convinced that I might hurt my baby. Obviously I had no intention of doing anything to him – but I became convinced I might.’ Miss Ellis became suicidal, convincing herself that Finn would be safer if she were dead. But then she read online that obsessing about harming a baby was a symptom of post-natal depression - and could often include thoughts about sexual abuse. She had counselling and therapy, and was given medication. ‘The problem is that people just don’t talk about it,’ she said. ‘If I had known that it was an illness, it would never have got that bad - I thought it was just me. ‘We need much more awareness of the symptoms.’ Miss Ellis is now training to be a radiographer and is engaged to partner Matt Williams, 36.

That declaration was an effort to frighten Americans and undermine growing support for expanding Medicare and Social Security—two popular programs that have long been derided as “socialist.” Mr. Trump’s declaration hypocritically ignores that he and his Republican colleagues are the nation’s leading purveyors of an insidious form of corporate socialism, which uses government power and taxpayer resources to enrich Mr. Trump and his billionaire friends. When we defeat Mr. Trump in this election, we are going to end his corporate socialism and use those resources to create a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights that benefits all people. Consider the corporate socialism we’ve seen on Wall Street, where the high priests of unfettered capitalism reign. As you will recall, Wall Street’s deification of “free markets” went out the window in 2008 as they watched the financial crisis caused by their own greed and illegal behavior threaten the existence of some of the largest financial institutions in the country. Suddenly, Wall Street became strong supporters of big-government socialism.

ae29f720,"WASHINGTON – Howard University is pleased to announce a $4 million gift from the Hopper-Dean Foundation to fund the Bison STEM Scholars Program (BSSP). The generous gift will provide 10 computer science or computer engineering students with a full-ride scholarship for four years. In addition to eliminating the financial burden for students, the gift will support the expansion of Howard’s STEM education program. The gift marks Howard’s largest gift received from a foundation to date. “The Hopper-Dean donation will make a life-altering difference in the lives of our students and we appreciate their investment and confidence in the University. This generous gift will further enhance Howard’s strategic plan and University mission to diversify the workforce with skillfully trained students who are prepared to focus on careers in computer science and computer engineering,” says President Wayne A. I. Frederick. “We have made significant progress over the last three years through the Bison STEM Program to change the landscape of what STEM Ph.D.s look like. This significant financial contribution by the Hopper-Dean Foundation speaks volumes to the caliber of the program and the student success achieved thus far.” In 2017, under the leadership and vision of President Frederick, Howard University launched BSSP to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who earn a Ph.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. in a STEM discipline. Each student has gone through a rigorous interview process and was hand-selected among the best and brightest scholars in the nation. The Hopper-Dean Foundation, a California nonprofit supported by Jeffrey Dean and Heidi Hopper, is partnering with Howard to address racial and gender disparity in STEM fields by removing the socioeconomic barriers to pursuing Ph.D.s and other advanced research degrees. The Hopper-Dean Bison STEM Scholars will receive a scholarship that covers 100 percent of the tuition and fees associated with attending the University and participating in the program. “As the importance of computing and computer science continues to grow, we truly believe the population of computer scientists should reflect that growth in terms of diversity,” said Jeffrey Dean and Heidi Hopper. “This gift to Howard University is designed to support Howard’s robust STEM education program and help expand its reach in the future.” In addition to student scholarships, the gift includes $1 million designated to the President’s Innovation Fund to support future programs and initiatives related to STEM education. “This generous contribution will allow the Bison STEM Scholars Program to continue providing minority students with a rigorous and supportive opportunity in STEM education. By participating in our program, these emerging scholars will be some of the most well-prepared candidates for graduate or professional degrees amongst their peers,” said Ron H. Smith, program director for the Bison STEM Scholars Program. “We look forward to growing our capacity to serve more students interested in pursuing professional careers in STEM with the support of this gift.” Each year, the program accepts a cohort of 30 scholars enrolled in programs within the College of Engineering and Architecture and the College of Arts and Sciences. In addition to maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.30 each semester, Bison STEM scholars are required to meet with a professional mentor, participate in summer research internships, study abroad and complete the summer bridge program for incoming freshmen. Upon graduation, the scholars will pursue careers in research, policy development or leadership roles related to STEM.

If you're a first time buyer, our Help to Buy: ISA could really help you get your foot on the property ladder. It's designed to take advantage of the Help to Buy Scheme, to boost your savings towards a deposit by 25% for your first home, Halifax's Help to buy ISA page reads. It sounds fantastic, offering people struggling to raise a deposit up to £3,000 extra towards the purchase of their own home. There's just one problem – it doesn't actually increase the deposit you pay the seller when you buy a home. Why they just don't work like we were told Image: Getty The devil is in the detail – in this case a clause in the deal, aimed at stopping people getting government cash without bothering to buy a home. The problem is that it also means that the money you have been promised can't be accessed until AFTER you buy. Consumers have been putting money aside on the basis that they believed it would be applied to their deposit on a new home; to now clarify that it is not actually available until completion is the perfect example of a painful lack of transparency and frankly nothing short of deception, said Mark Hayward, managing director, National Association of Estate Agents. Effectively, this means the 500,000 people who've taken out the savings products will get no help to buy at all until the house purchase is completed - and will have to cover the entire deposit passed on to the seller when contracts are exchanged themselves. First-time buyers are already struggling with getting on to the housing ladder and this much hyped initiative was welcomed at the time as a way of helping them, but in fact could have ended up costing buyers if they have gone ahead with a purchase believing that the bonus counted towards the deposit,” Hayward added. In the wake of the revelations – first printed in the Daily Telegraph - the government heavily updated its help to buy page. “When you buy your first home, your solicitor or conveyancer will apply for your government bonus. Once they receive the government bonus, it will be added to the money you are putting towards your first home,” the page read in April this year . The same section now reads: “When you are close to buying your first home, you will need to instruct your solicitor or conveyancer to apply for your government bonus. Once they receive the government bonus, it will be added to the money you are putting towards your first home. The bonus must be included with the funds consolidated at the completion of the property transaction. The bonus cannot be used for the deposit due at the exchange of contracts, to pay for solicitor’s, estate agent’s fees or any other indirect costs associated with buying a home.” poll loading Should help to buy ISAs be re-named? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Is it good for anything then? The silver lining for people who've taken out one of these products to help them buy a home is that you do, still, get the cash and it can be used to lighten the load of your mortgage repayments. That's because while useless in increasing the size of your deposit, the money can be accessed once the property has been bought and used lower your mortgage balance. That means they CAN count to the deposit as far as the mortgage lender is concerned, just not as far as the seller is concerned. The Mirror has also spoken to people who found the offer of the bonus incentivised them to save more regularly than they had been before thanks to the promise of a 25% boost. But if you were looking for actual help to buy a home in the form of extra money towards a deposit to pay the seller, this isn't the product for you – despite the name.","Legendary Actor Kirk Douglas Dead, 4 Days Before His 101st Birthday",FALSE
db269032,"Miranda appeal court rules anti terrorism laws breach fundamental rights and have been misinterpreted by the police and Secretary of State In a landmark ruling, the Court of Appeal today allowed David Miranda's appeal against the use of controversial police powers to stop, detain, question and search him at Heathrow Airport in August 2013. At the time he had been stopped Miranda was assisting the work of his partner, the award-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was publishing articles about Edward Snowden's mass surveillance revelations. Led by its most senior judge, Lord Dyson MR, the court found that the powers, contained in Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, are flawed. They breach fundamental rights, because they do not afford effective protection for the basic rights of journalists, and those working with them, that are protected in other areas of British law, including other anti terrorism legislation paragraph 113. He added if journalists and their sources can have no expectation of confidentiality, they may decide against providing information on sensitive matters of public interest. The court went on to hold that the breach would need to be remedied by Parliament by introducing judicial oversight when such powers are used at ports. The decision is also important because for the first time the Court of Appeal rejected the very broad definition of 'terrorism' put forward by lawyers for the police and the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State had argued that the 2000 Act definition of terrorism includes those involved in lawful political activity - such as journalists or protestors - if they accidentally and inadvertently do something that puts lives at risk. In overruling the Divisional Court, the Court of Appeal said that the Secretary of State was wrong and terrorism required some intention to cause a serious threat to public safety, such as endangering life. Dyson MR commented: If Parliament had intended to provide that a person commits an act of terrorism where he unwittingly or accidentally does something which in fact endangers another person's life, I would have expected that, in view of the serious consequences of classifying a person as a terrorist, it would have spelt this out clearly paragraph 54. Although it allowed David Miranda's appeal, the Court of Appeal did not accept his argument that the police had acted for a purpose that fell outside Schedule 7. It said that Schedule 7 powers were so unusually broad that they could be exercised for reasons that were in the mind of one of the officers in the command chain, even though that officer did not actually perform the stop, had no reasonable basis for those reasons, and had not communicated those reasons to any other officers who did carry out the stop. Given this, Dyson MR concluded I would hold that the exercise of the Schedule 7 stop power in relation to Mr Miranda on 18 August 2013 was lawful para 119. The Schedule 7 powers, under which David Miranda was questioned and detained for nine hours, allow the police to act without any reasonable grounds to suspect a person of terrorism. Hundreds of thousands of people have been stopped under those powers that have been in place for more than 15 years and they are highly controversial. However, their use to seize material being used by a journalist, without seeking the prior judicial authorisation that would have been required outside an airport and without any reasonable grounds to suspect that David Miranda was involved in terrorist activity, caused an international outcry. As a result of this ruling the law will have to be changed so that journalists are better protected. Kate Goold of Bindmans LLP said: Today's ruling emphasises the importance of interpreting terrorism with its ordinary natural meaning to ensure that legitimate public interest journalism is not stifled through the use of draconian powers because of the fear of remote consequences. The notion of a journalist becoming an accidental terrorist has been whole-heartedly rejected. We welcome this court's principled and decisive ruling that Schedule 7 needs to come in line with other legislation to ensure that the seizure of journalistic material is protected by judicial safeguards.

ff52ac93,"@amysherman1 Charlie Crist dismissed the idea of debating former state Sen. Nan Rich in a Democratic primary for governor. Here’s part of the transcript from a press gaggle at a Crist fundraiser at Greenspoon Marder law firm in Fort Lauderdale today: Q: “Will you be debating Nan Rich and if so do you think that will be in Broward and how many times do you expect to debate her?” Crist: “I don't.” Q: “You don't expect you'll be debating her?” Crist: “I'm not even thinking about it right now to be honest with you Tony [Man, Sun-Sentinel reporter.] I am focused on doing everything I can to help the people of Florida. And this is not a race really about candidates this is a race about people of our state -- about teachers, about law enforcement officers, firefighters, people that in my opinion have not been honored in the way they deserve to be honored....” Q: “The folks at Broward Days though think you should at least give it a shake to debate her. Especially Broward County is such a Democratic stronghold. They said they heard back from her campaign that she’d be willing to talk to you in a forum like that but no plans for that?” Crist: “No.” Crist was later asked about his stance on gay marriage, medical marijuana and Gov. Rick Scott’s proposed education budget. Crist: “Like the president, let’s start with that, I always supported civil unions. But I thought about it just as President Obama thought about it and I have come to the conclusion as the pope said himself ‘who am I to judge?’ I’ve always been a live and let live kind of guy that’s what’s in my heart....” Q: Did you ever publicly express your support for civil unions? Crist: “Yes.” (See Marc Caputo's analysis of Crist and civil unions here.) “On the issue of medical marijuana I am delighted that it is going to be on the ballot. I will vote for it. I think it is the right thing to do . If you have a physician who wants to prescribe medical marijuana for a patient who is suffering or has loss of appetite why would you be opposed to that?...” Q: ""What’s your thought on Common Core and on Scott’s education budget proposal yesterday . If you were governor would you fund education any differently than what he proposed yesterday?"" Crist: “Yeah and what he proposed when he first got there. Cutting education by $1.3 billion first year your first year as governor in state of Florida is ridiculous. It seems to me that trying to make some conversion in the election year and acting like you really care about education is laughable. I’ll just be straight up on this I just don’t think we can believe what he’s doing....,” he said, before slipping in a mention of the $1.7 billion Medicaid fine paid for by Scott’s former health care company. “If I get the opportunity because of the kindness of people of Florida to be involved in crafting an education budget....I’m a friend of education, always have been, always will be.” Q: ""Are you a supporter of Common Core?""

9f10a8a9,"It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",A 62% Top Tax Rate?,other

c9c7a951,"Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Much of the Amazon could be on the verge of losing its distinct nature and switching from a closed canopy rainforest to an open savannah with far fewer trees as a result of the climate crisis, researchers have warned. Rainforests are highly sensitive to changes in rainfall and moisture levels, and fires and prolonged droughts can result in areas losing trees and shifting to a savannah-like mix of woodland and grassland. In the Amazon, such changes were known to be possible but thought to be many decades away. New research shows that this tipping point could be much closer than previously thought. As much as 40% of the existing Amazon rainforest is now at a point where it could exist as a savannah instead of as rainforest, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications. Any shift from rainforest to savannah would still take decades to take full effect, but once under way the process is hard to reverse. Rainforests support a vastly greater range of species than savannah and play a much greater role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Parts of the Amazon are receiving much less rain than they used to because of the changing climate. Rainfall in about 40% of the forest is now at a level where the rainforest could be expected to exist as savannah instead, according to the study, led by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on computer models and data analysis.
Last year, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, was warned that the continued destruction of the Amazon by fire and loggers would bring the region closer to a tipping point where rainforest could turn to savannah. This year’s fires in the Amazon are the worst in a decade, with a 60% increase in fire hotspots compared with last year. Arie Staal, lead author of the study, said the ecology of rainforests meant that although they effectively produce their own self-sustaining rainfall in the right climate, they are also prone to drying out in the wrong conditions. “As forests grow and spread across a region, this affects rainfall,” he explained. “Forests create their own rain because leaves give off water vapour and this falls as rain further downwind. Rainfall means fewer fires leading to even more forests.” But if large areas of rainforest are lost, rainfall levels in the region decline accordingly. This reduced level of “atmospheric moisture recycling” was simulated in the computer models used in the study. “Drier conditions make it harder for the forest to recover and increase the flammability of the ecosystem,” Staal told the Guardian. Once rainforest has crossed the threshold and converted to an open savannah-type mix of wood and grassland, it is unlikely to revert naturally to its former state. “It is harder to return from the ‘trap’ caused by the feedback mechanism in which the open, grassy ecosystem is more flammable, and the fires, in turn, keep the ecosystem open,” he said.

Source: Staal et al, Nature Communications, Obbe Tuinenburg The team of researchers ran computer simulations of where forests might be expected to exist across the earth’s tropical regions, given certain climatic conditions, and looked at the minimum and maximum areas of likely forest cover. They also looked at what was likely to happen if greenhouse gas emissions kept rising, and found that the ability of forests to grow back once trees were lost would be much reduced. Ingo Fetzer of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, co-author of the paper, said: “We understand now that rainforests on all continents are very sensitive to global change and can rapidly lose their ability to adapt. Once gone, their recovery will take many decades to return to their original state. And given that rainforests host the majority of all global species, all this will be forever lost.”",Zakharova Says New Salisbury Claims Aim to Distract Public From the Incident,other
9f4d9fd2,"Aung San Suu Kyi Residence Rangoon, Burma 12:35 P.M. MMT DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: I'm sorry if we've kept you waiting. Let me just begin by saying what a great pleasure it is for me to welcome President Obama again to my house and to be able to meet all of you. I would just like to say that there have been those who have been saying that there is tension between the United States and the National League for Democracy or perhaps with me. I would like to make it quite clear that the friendship between the United States and those who have been struggling for democracy in Burma is a very strong one. We may view things differently from time to time but it will in no way affect our friendship. And I have absolute confidence that the United States will continue to support us with regard to the democratic transformation and that when Burma becomes a fully functioning democracy in accordance with the will of the people, we will be able to say that among those friends who enabled us to get there, the United States was among the first. So please don't think -- please don't worry that there will be any problems between the United States and those working for democracy in Burma. We all believe in the same values. We all believe in the same principles. We may sometimes think that there are different ways of getting to the goal that we wish to achieve, but these differences are part of the democratic tradition. Democracy allows people to have different views, and democracy makes it also -- makes us also responsible for negotiating an answer for those views. I would like all of you to feel welcome in this country, and I would like all of you to feel that you can join us in hoping for better days. But at the same time, I always warn against over-optimism because that could lead to complacency. Our reform process is going through, let’s just say, a bumpy patch. But this bumpy patch is something that we can negotiate with commitment and with the help and understanding of our friends from all over the world. So let us not exaggerate the differences and the difficulties. But at the same time, let us not exaggerate the rosy picture either. What we need is a healthy balance between optimism and pessimism. We need to view the situation for what it was. But at the same time, we all have to be confident that we will get there -- we will get where we want to get to, because that’s what our people want. In the end, it’s the people of Burma who will decide where this country is going to and which way and how and when. So we accept responsibility for the state of our country, but at the same time we welcome the support and the help of our friends. And we always appreciate them very greatly. Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, good afternoon, everybody. Mingalaba. It is wonderful to be back in Rangoon and to once more have the opportunity to spend time with Aung San Suu Kyi. As we know, it was in this house that she endured years of confinement -- never giving up hope, never wavering in her determination to build a free and democratic Burma. Daw Suu, you helped set this country on a better path. I’m grateful for your friendship and for the hospitality that you’ve shown in opening your home up not only to me, but to all these people. When I made my first historic visit to Burma, this country was just taking preliminary steps towards democracy. And in the past two years, important changes have been made. The economy has begun to grow. Political prisoners have been set free. There are more newspapers and media outlets. Children have been released from the military. And these are all important changes that have opened up greater opportunity for the people of Burma. At the same time, as Aung San Suu Kyi just said, it’s clear how much hard work remains to be done and that many difficult choices still lie ahead. The process for reform is by no means complete or irreversible. For many, progress has not come fast enough or spread far enough. People need to feel safe in their homes and not be subject to arbitrary harassment by authorities or individuals acting with impunity. People need to be empowered to pursue their dreams. And as Burma approaches important national elections next year, it will be critical to ensure that all of Burma’s people can participate in shaping the future of their country. As a member of parliament and the head of the rule of law committee, Aung San Suu Kyi is working hard to make government more transparent, more accountable, to protect the rights of all the Burmese people, to promote reforms that would expand the political space for more people to contribute their voices. But implementing the major political and economic reforms that are necessary to keep Burma advancing toward democracy is going to take a great deal of political will and no small amount of determination. And we, as friends of the Burmese people, are clear-eyed about the scale of the challenges that remain, and recognize that we cannot remain complacent. Today, Daw Suu and I had a wide-ranging discussion about how the United States can help facilitate and bolster Burma’s democratic transition. We talked about the need for stronger rule of law, for elections that are free, fair and inclusive, and for continued constitutional changes that will move Burma more fully towards a civilian government. We spoke about how we can work together to promote national reconciliation and defuse sectarian tensions among Burma’s diverse ethnic groups. Specifically, I stressed the need to find durable and effective solutions for the terrible violence in Rakhine state -- solutions that end discrimination, provide greater security and economic opportunities, protect all citizens, and promote greater tolerance and understanding. Strengthening human rights protections for all of Burma’s people is an essential step to realizing the vision we share for the future of this beautiful country. The last time I stood here, I made a pledge to the people of Burma -- that if we continued to see progress toward reform, the ties between our countries would grow stronger, and the United States would continue to do whatever it could to help ensure Burma’s success. Over the last two years, I think we’ve made good on that pledge, and I want to reiterate the commitment to match continued reforms with greater support and friendships in the future. We’re committed to working directly with the people of Burma, and not just the government. So later today, I’m looking forward to speaking with representatives of Burma’s civil society groups and with young leaders from Burma and all across Southeast Asia who are working to create greater opportunities for themselves and for future generations. I think these new voices are going to be critical to making sure that reforms are sustainable and meaningful to people across the country and across the region. So, Daw Suu, thank you again for welcoming us here today. We continue to look to you for inspiration as well as resolve, and I know that you will continue to be a fierce advocate on behalf of the people of Burma, a future of democracy, and I know that you will be a strong partner with the United States. Thank you. Questions? DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: Who’s speaking? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I’ll go first. Christi Parsons. Q You have been traveling in countries with long histories of repressing freedom of expression and censorship. And it was interesting yesterday that President Xi seemed to be saying that reporters who have problems have themselves to blame. And so I wonder to what extent you feel the need to contend with these ideas with leaders in this region as you travel. And what do you say to them? And by way of example, I might ask you -- Attorney General Eric Holder says no journalist will go to prison for doing his or her job, on his watch.And so I ask about the case of James Risen, the journalist who is facing this prosecution for not revealing his source in a leak prosecution. I wonder if that’s -- are you speaking specifically about this case, and is that your position as well? And if I may, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, ask you -- how concerned are you about the violence against ethnic minorities in your country, and specifically the Rohingya people? And what do you believe is your responsibility to speak out about it? Thank you very much. PRESIDENT OBAMA: The issue of press freedom is a constant concern in my interactions with the Chinese government. It’s an issue that I’ve raised with the President here in Burma. I’m pretty blunt and pretty frank about the fact that societies that repress journalists ultimately oppress people as well, and that if you want a society that is free and vibrant and successful, part of that formula is the free flow of information, of ideas, and that requires a free press. That is part of our tradition. As I explained to President Xi in China, it’s in our DNA. We believe in the primacy individuals being able to pursue their dreams, endowed with certain inalienable rights. And we believe that when governments censor or control information, that ultimately that undermines not only the society, but it leads to eventual encroachments on individual rights as well. I can't comment, Christi, on any particular pending case, as you know -- that's sort of an iron-clad rule -- or any particular prosecution. I can read back to you what Attorney General Holder has said, which is no journalist is going to go to jail for doing their job. And I don't think you're suggesting that there's -- that the two cases are comparable. But I recognize that in our own society we have to constantly balance the need for certain national security issues to remain secret with journalists pursuing leads wherever they can. And the good news is, is that we've got courts and we've got a First Amendment. And we got a whole bunch of tools to ensure that that balance is properly debated and adjudicated. But I think that when I am traveling, it is important as the President of the United States to not just talk about our interests, but also to talk about our values. Sometimes it has an impact; sometimes it doesn't. Although I was impressed that Mark Landler got an answer to his question from President Xi. It might not have been the one he was expecting, but he did end up taking the question. So you just keep on chipping away and seeing if we can make progress. Q (Off-mic.) PRESIDENT OBAMA: Hold on a second, Christi. Don't try to segue into a second question. DAW AUNG SAN SUI KYI: I think I better take over (inaudible) my time as well. PRESIDENT OBAMA: There you go. DAW AUNG SAN SUI KYI: The National League for Democracy always has been against violence of any kind, either on the racial grounds, or religious grounds, or ideological grounds. We do not believe that violence really results in (inaudible). Our struggle for democracy has been carried out with a strong grasp on the principle of nonviolence. And also, we believe in the rule of law. So if you ask how do we propose to resolve all of these problems of violence between communities, between different ethnic groups, we've got to start with rule of law. People have to feel secure before they can start talking to one another. We cannot achieve harmony without security. People who feel threatened are not going to sit down and sort out their problems. So I would like to recommend, as the chair of the Rule of Law and Tranquility Committee -- don't forget that tranquility is also included -- that the government should look to rule of law. It is the duty of the government to make all our people feel secure, and it is the duty of our people to learn to live in harmony with one another. If we want democracy, we have to be prepared to live by the principles of democracy. We have to dare to live according to the principles of democracy. I think we'll get there, but it will take us some time. But we will remain fully committed to the principle of nonviolence. Q Mr. President, I'd like to know about the Myanmar reforms. You've been talking with the President and parliament speakers, and also you're going to talk with the civil societies group, and then youth. So my question to you is that: Have you got any specific agreement with the Myanmar government or President Thein Sein about Myanmar reforms such as constitutional change, and peace negotiation, peace process, and also 2015 general election? And also to Daw Aung San Sui Kyi, you've got a one-hour discussion with the President, and at the current (inaudible), as you said, it’s a bumpy situation. So if you didn't make amendment, or you didn't change constitution, the NLD and you, yourself, is going to be very difficult after 2015 elections. So have you talked about those issues with the President? Or the President talk to you about U.S. support for you? Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, the issue of making sure that reforms and the transition is fully realized was the main topic of our conversation and the main topic of my conversation with the President last night. As I indicated before, there are signs of progress. We shouldn't deny that Burma today is not the same as Burma five years ago. But the process is still incomplete. And I was very specific with the President in terms of how we will measure whether or not the transition has been fully realized. Number one, we expect elections to take place on time. We do not want to see delays, because it's time for the voice of the people of Burma to be heard in a fair, free, transparent election. Number two, I indicated to the President that the constitution amendment process needs to reflect inclusion rather than exclusion, that there are certain provisions in the Burmese constitution that objectively don't make much sense. Ultimately, what changes are made are up to the people of Burma. But, for example, I don't understand a provision that would bar somebody from running for President because of who their children are. That doesn't make much sense to me. Number three, we are very much in favor of the peace process, and I encourage the President to move forward in the negotiations. He expressed some optimism about the ability to bring a deal to a conclusion. But as Daw Suu has indicated, you have to be skeptical until it's actually done. Number four, I indicated that we are paying attention to how religious minorities are treated in this country. Now, I recognize the complexities of the situation in Rakhine state. On the other hand, consistent with what Daw Suu just said, I am a firm believer that any legitimate government has to be based on rule of law and a recognition that all people are equal under the law. And discrimination against the Rohingya or any other religious minority I think does not express the kind of country that Burma over the long term wants to be. And I know of no successful democracy in which sectarian or religious divisions are allowed to fester, or the people of different faiths are treated as second-class citizens. Ultimately, that is destabilizing to a democracy. And finally, I expressed to the President the need to continue to make additional progress on basic issues of freedom and personal security, that journalists can't be jailed simply because they were critical of the government; that arbitrary arrests or individuals being in some fashion abused by government with impunity rather than being respected and treated in accordance with law, that that's a test of whether or not a society is moving towards a genuine democratic process. And the President yesterday acknowledged that some progress has been made, and there was more to do. And our position will be to continue to measure what's happening on the ground, to consult with a wide range of groups here in Burma. We will strengthen our relationship where we see progress. Where we dn see progress. Where we don’t see progress, then we will continue to express our concerns, and we will not be able to fully realize the kind of bilateral relationship that we want to have with Burma, the Burmese government, until we’ve seen some of these reforms completed. DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: You asked whether (inaudible) NLD to win the elections if the amendments to the constitution are not pushed through. I think it’s too early to ask this question. We’ve just spent one afternoon debating the question of constitutional amendment. I think perhaps some of you may have heard that proportional representation is not going to be instituted. So when we started defending (inaudible) against proportional representation, there were many who said to us, you are a very small minority in the legislature; how can you hope to win this case? It’s not a matter of wanting to win a case, it’s a matter of standing up for what you believe in, for what you believe is necessary for the future of our country. Now we are asking for a constitutional amendment not because we’re trying to win a case, but because we think that certain amendments are necessary if this country is to be a truly functioning democracy in line with the will of the people. Because of that, we will persist in our efforts to have the constitution amended in the right way and within the framework of the law. I’ve always put great emphasis on this because I want peace and tranquility in our country. I want our people to learn to live under the rule of law, and to support and uphold the importance of the rule of law. So with regard to the constitution, we know that the people support our wish to amend it in certain ways, and we are prepared to negotiate with those who do not wish to amend the constitution. I think that’s what democracy is all about. We need a culture of negotiated compromise as the foundation for our democratic union. So we would like to -- it’s not just a matter of debating the case in parliament and winning Brownie points or Boy Scout points, or whatever they’re called. But it’s just a case of standing up for what we think our country needs. And we would like to talk to those who disagree with us. That, again, is what democracy is about. You talk to those who disagree with you; you don’t beat them down. You exchange views. And you come to a compromise, a settlement that would be best for the country. I’ve always said that dialogues and debates are not aimed at achieving victory for one particular party or the other, but victory for our people as a whole. Whatever we decide on should be seen as a victory for our nation, for the kind of democratic union that we have been trying to build up for decades. So please don’t worry about whether or not we will win the elections in 2015. Of course, any party wants to win the elections. I’m sure the President will tell you that. (Laughter.) But winning is not everything -- it’s how you win. I’d rather lose than win in the wrong way. And that is the way I want our party and our people to approach the problems that we have to tackle -- that we want to win in the right way. We want to bring the changes of the constitution about in the right way. We want to build up a strong foundation for national reconciliation, which means reconciliation not just between the different ethnic groups and between different religious groups, but between different ideas -- for example, between the idea of military supremacy and the idea of civilian authority over the military, which is the foundation of democracy. So we want to exchange views and to come to an understanding with all those who at this moment do not yet agree with us. And we are confident that we can come to such a settlement, come to such an agreement because, after all, I do believe that what all of us want is what is best for the country as a whole -- not just for particular individuals or groups or organizations. So while I tell you that you need not worry about what affects amendment or non-amendment to the constitution might have on the elections, I might as well ask you to vote for us when we do get there. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Pete Maer. Q Mr. President, it seems the stage is set for even more confrontations between you and Republicans when you get home, if that’s possible. We’re told that you’re soon going to sign the immigration reform executive order. To what extent are you concerned about a Republican backlash from an action of that magnitude? And on two other issues, I’m wondering what your take is on the plan to pass a bill to build the Keystone pipeline that’s in the works now, before the State Department’s review process is over. And Senator McConnell is angry over the climate deal that you had made with China. How does all of this square with your post-election assessment that people want to, as you put it, get stuff done? And if I may also pose a question to you, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Thank you for hosting all of us here from the White House media corps. As the President mentioned of the constitutional barring of you running in your country’s election, what do you think the impact will be from the President’s statement that was made here today on his strong opposition to that constitutional wording? And what impact do you think it will have on the government here? And is there anything more that you’d like to see him do? Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Pete, the day after the election I said that there are going to be areas of agreement between me and Republicans, and there are going to be areas of disagreement. There are going to be actions I take they don’t like, and there are going to be bills they pass that I don’t like. And I think, moving forward, that’s exactly what’s going to happen. You’ve mentioned areas where we disagree. I believe that America is a nation of immigrants. Everybody agrees that the system is broken. There has been ample opportunity for Congress to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would strengthen our borders, improve the legal immigration system, lift millions of people out of the shadows so they are paying taxes and getting right by the law. It passed out of the Senate. I gave the House over a year to go ahead and at least give a vote to the Senate bilaterally; they failed to do so. And I indicated to Speaker Boehner several months ago that if, in fact, Congress failed to act, I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better. And that’s going to happen. That’s going to happen before the end of the year. But what I’ve also said to them -- and I said this during the lunch with the Speaker and Leader McConnell -- is that I am always interested in negotiating a legislative solution to the immigration problem, and that the minute they pass a bill that I can sign that fixes our immigration system, then any executive actions I take are replaced. So they have the ability to fix the system. What they don’t have the ability to do is to expect me to stand by with a broken system in perpetuity. And I would advise that if, in fact, they want to take a different approach, rather than devote a lot of time trying to constrain my lawful actions as the Chief Executive of the U.S. government in charge of our enforcing our immigration laws, that they spend some time passing a bill and engaging with all the stakeholders, the immigrant rights groups, the law enforcement groups, the evangelicals, the business community, all of whom have said this is something that needs to be done, is way overdue. And we’ve been talking about it for 10 years now, and it’s been consistently stalled. So with respect to Keystone, I’ve been clear in the past, Pete, my position hasn’t changed, that this is a process that is supposed to be followed. Right now you have a case pending in Nebraska, where the pipeline would run through, in which a state court judge has questioned the plan. And until we know what the route is, it’s very hard to finish that evaluation. And I don’t think we should short-circuit that process. I have also noted that, as policy matter, my government believes that we should judge this pipeline based on whether or not it accelerates climate change or whether it helps the American people with their energy costs and their gas prices. And I have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the Keystone pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the United States, or is somehow lowering gas prices. Understand what this project is. It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices. You know what does have an impact on U.S. gas prices is the incredible boom in U.S. oil production and natural gas production that's taken place under my administration. And if my Republican friends really want to focus on what's good for the American people in terms of job creation and lower energy costs, we should be engaging in a conversation about what are we doing to produce even more homegrown energy. I'm happy to have that conversation. With respect to the climate change deal, I have been very clear that I have responsibilities as President not just to current generations, but to future generations. The science is indisputable. The planet is getting warm, and it is getting warmer in part because of man-made activity. And the release of carbon gases -- carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere can have a potentially devastating effect that will cost our country, could devastate communities, could increase the impact of natural disasters, and will have an impact worldwide that is destabilizing and could affect our national security. That's not my opinion, by the way, that is the opinion of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, that climate change is a direct national security threat. Now the argument that I've received in the past has been either denial of the science or, alternatively, there's no point in us doing something about it despite us being one of the two largest emitters in the world, because if we do something and China doesn't do anything, we'll just put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage, we'll lose jobs to China, and the problem won't be solved anyway. I'm not going deny the science, but I took seriously the notion that we want all countries to participate in solving a global problem. And so I engaged with China over a lengthy set of negotiations. And by all independent accounts, for the first time, we got China to make a very serious commitment to constrain its greenhouse gases. Why would anybody be against that? That sounds like the right thing to do to me. So that's a response to those specific ideas. But let me reiterate what I said at the top. The fact that I disagree or Republicans disagree with me on a certain set of issues doesn't exclude us working together on a whole range of issues where we do agree. They're interested in tax reform -- so am I. Let's get to work. They're interested in promoting trade that will create jobs and opportunity for U.S. workers and U.S. businesses -- all over it. It's part of what this Asia trip has been all about.They're interested in rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, putting people back to work, making sure we're competitive -- I'm game. So the one thing that I think is going to be important for us to have a successful partnership over the next couple of years is not making disagreements on a single issue suddenly a deal-breaker on every issue. Democracy can never work that way because there are always going to be some differences. And when there are differences you can't elevate those differences above the commonalities. I'm sorry that was a long answer, but it was a lot of questions. Do you want to -- DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: I'm sorry the President can't get away from all those. PRESIDENT OBAMA: I know. But before Daw Suu responds to the point about the constitutional amendment, I just want to emphasize, ultimately it's up to the people of Burma to make a decision about all these provisions. I expressed an objective view that some of current provisions don't seem to have much grounding in common sense or precedent when you look at other constitutions around the world, and seem more focused on advantaging or disadvantaging certain players. And one of the basic concepts of a constitution is that it creates a level playing field for all people, and then so I use that as an example not because I think my voice is the one that's most relevant in terms of the constitutional amendment process, but ultimately it's up to the people of Burma. Q (Off-mic.) PRESIDENT OBAMA: I did? It doesn't make much sense to me. DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: I believe democracy should stand up for that principle. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely. DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: Well, I've always said that it's somewhat flattering to have a constitution written with me in mind. But it shouldn't be done that way. That's not how a democratic constitution should be written. And we object to that clause not because -- not because it debars me from the presidency as such, but because it is against the principle of democracy and also unconstitutional. The constitution says that all citizens should be treated as equals, and this is discrimination on the grounds of my children, my children's spouses, et cetera, et cetera. Now, this is not acceptable. And our people are firmly behind us in our desire to change this clause. And if President Obama said anything about the necessity to change a clause like that, they will love him very much for it. (Laughter.) So he will be very popular among our people. And as he said, in the end, it is up to our people to shape the destiny of our country, including the way the constitution is going to be rewritten. And I think the majority of our people understand that this constitution cannot stand as it is if we want to make the full transition to democracy; 59(f), as you know, debars anybody who is children of -- the spouses of the children belong to -- are citizens of another country. And according to the law -- and I think the President will know the law better than I do because I'm not a lawyer -- according to the law, anybody who is over the age of 18, or whatever legal adult age may be in his or her country, is responsible for himself or herself. Nobody else is responsible for that person. So from that point of view also, you cannot penalize anybody for what his or her adult children do. From that point of view, it's illegal, it's against all norms of justice. And from the point of view of democracy, it is not right to discriminate against one particular citizen. You wouldn't like to be discriminated against, would you? So I think our people support the idea of amending this clause because -- not particularly because they want me to be president, perhaps because they do. But I don't think it is so much because of that, but because they realize that this is unfair, unjust and undemocratic. Q Thank you. I would like to ask the question to Mr. President. The question is, have you discussed about the very situation in Myanmar (inaudible)? Because more journalists and politicians have been arrested, particularly (inaudible) under the present administration. (Inaudible) how he responds to this (inaudible)? Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: I didn't bring up specific cases with him. I brought up a basic principle that I stated earlier, which is that a free press is a foundation for any democracy. We rely on journalists to explain and describe the actions of our government. If the government controls the journalists, then it's very difficult for citizens to hold that government accountable. It's a fairly straightforward proposition. And I recognize that there is a transition process that's taking place, that there is a more robust debate today than there was the last time I visited. But to go back to what we said earlier, we can't be complacent. And we, as a government, are going to be troubled when we hear reports of journalists being imprisoned, being killed, being intimidated, or being censored. And when we engage with this government -- or any government -- and we have evidence that that's taking place, then we're going to raise it. Thank you very much. END 1:10 P.M.

052f60f4,"Earth Could Be Facing Another Ice Age, Scientists Warn Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark the next ice age. Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark an ice age. Computer simulations show that an explosion of sea ice would block the ocean from exchanging carbon dioxide with the atmosphere Computer simulations show that an explosion in ice circling the frozen desert would act as a lid on the ocean and block it from exchanging carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. This is capable of causing a reverse greenhouse effect, which would ultimately cool the earth and send our planet into an ice age for the first time in over two million years. The last major ice age is believed to have ended about 2.5 million years ago during the Pleistocene era. Since then, glaciers have periodically covered the earth, but then retreated and experts have now set out to understand the process behind an ice age — how it works and what triggers it. The latest study was conducted by a team at the University of Chicago who set out to discover and understand the processes that makeup global climate. Assistant professor Malte Jansen at the University of Chicago (UChicago) said, ‘One key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages.’ ‘We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed, but we don’t quite know how or why.’ This event is capable of causing a reverse greenhouse effect, which would ultimately cool the earth and send our planet into an ice age for the first time in over two million years Jansen and former UChicago postdoctoral researcher Alice Marzocchi developed computer simulations of Antarctica sea ice and found it not only changes ocean circulation but acts as a lid and blocks it from releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – the less carbon in the air, the cooler the planet becomes. ‘What this suggests is that it’s a feedback loop,’ said Marzocchi, now a research scientist at the UK’s National Oceanography Center. ‘As the temperature drops, less carbon is released into the atmosphere, which triggers more cooling.’ The explanation fits with evidence about the past climate from sources like sediments, coral reefs, and core samples from glaciers. ‘What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone, with Antarctic sea-ice cover being the key player,’ Marzocchi said.",Central Europe would veto any Brexit deal limiting rights to work in Britain: Slovak PM,FALSE

8de5ccdd,"248 Counties Have More Registered Voters Than Live Adults 24 States Show Corrupted Voter Rolls (INDIANAPOLIS, IN.) – September 25, 2017: The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) today announced that it placed 248 counties on notice for holding more registered voters than adult residents in their respective jurisdictions. Officials in 24 states now risk lawsuits if they do not disclose satisfactory data demonstrating effective voter roll maintenance efforts before and after the 2016 Election. “During the 2016 Election, 24 states had bloated voter rolls,” PILF President and General Counsel J. Christian Adams said. “Voter fraud begins with corrupted voter rolls. Our nation’s voter rolls have records that cannot be distinguished between living or dead; citizen or alien; resident or relocated. We hear about possible cyber-attacks, but we aren’t doing enough to fix voter rolls that are certainly corrupt. The voter rolls are so bad in some states that election officials would have a hard time telling the difference between sabotage and negligence.” Letters mailed to the counties and locales in question note that it appears they are violating the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) because they are not properly maintaining the voter rolls. The NVRA (also known as Motor Voter) requires state and local election officials to properly maintain voter rolls and ensure that only eligible voters are registered. Holding more registrants than living adults indicates that election officials have failed to properly maintain voter rolls. The Public Interest Legal Foundation has a distinguished record of bringing litigation against counties and locales with bloated voter rolls—yielding settlements and consent decrees that, if followed properly, will put jurisdictions on a path to more realistic voter registration rates. PILF has been involved in bringing nine separate lawsuits in the last two years to enforce list maintenance provisions of the NVRA, including in Texas, Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania. PILF recently completed the first trial in the history of the NVRA to enforce list maintenance obligations. The case was brought on behalf of the American Civil Rights Union against Broward County, Florida. States with counties that received a notice letter are (# of counties): Kentucky (41), Michigan (32), Iowa (31), Illinois (22), Mississippi (19), Colorado (17), Texas (12), Alabama (12), South Dakota (12), Nebraska (9), Georgia (6), New York (6), West Virginia (6), New Mexico (5), North Carolina (5), California (2), Louisiana (2), Montana (2), Virginia (2), Arizona (1), Florida (1), Missouri (1), Oklahoma (1), and Washington State (1). Kentucky’s surpassing Michigan as the most bloated state is particularly concerning giving the Secretary of State’s belligerent, public refusals to share voter data with the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, despite the State’s offering of the same information here. “Federal law requires election officials to conduct a reasonable effort to maintain voter registration lists free of dead voters, ineligible voters, and voters who have moved away,” the notice letters state. “Based on our comparison of publicly available information published by the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal Election Assistance Commission, it appears that your jurisdiction is failing to comply with these federal law requirements.” The notices seek a variety of documents to clearly discern which jurisdictions are failing to perform basic voter list maintenance duties. Some records sought concern: noncitizen voters; numbers of dead, duplicate, relocated, and felon removals; evidence of use for databases which better identify relocated or alien registrants; and third-party communications about voter rolls, among others. If a local official fails to respond to PILF’s letter or declines to allow inspection of election records, they risk a federal lawsuit. A listing off all jurisdictions recently given notice under the NVRA can be found, here. A copy of an example notice letter sent may be reviewed, here. Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) is a 501(c)(3) public interest law firm dedicated to election integrity. The Foundation exists to assist states and others to aid the cause of election integrity and fight against lawlessness in American elections. Drawing on numerous experts in the field, PILF seeks to protect the right to vote and preserve the Constitutional framework of American elections. ###",The Phony War Against CO2,FALSE
70d7c3f7,"ADVERTISEMENT The fire that gutted a flank of the Treasury House, office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, was caused by an electric spark at about 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, says. Mr Agba spoke with journalists after the fire was put out. He said the fire started in an office on the third floor of the building. He further explained that the fire occurred “after an officer came to the office. He said he put on the air conditioner and there was a spark and immediately he put it off.” Earlier, the Federal Fire Service announced in a tweet that its team had put out the fire, with combined efforts from sister-agencies. This was buttressed by Mr Agba who said the fire service initially had difficulty getting into the building, but after about 35 minutes the fire was contained. “They got inside and fought the fire. Five fire trucks were used within 35 minutes,” he said. Already, there are subtle innuendos on social media that the fire was staged to excuse the government of accounting for funds meant to fight COVID-19 in the country. But Mr Agba brushed this aside, saying that not only is its data intact, its operations are largely digital. “We have gone round the offices that were affected, our data centre where all our records are fully intact. There is no disruption. For a while now we have gone digital,” the minister added, a mask strapped around his mouth, himself and his audience violating the physical distancing directive. “Even if the data centre were to be affected, we have a backup centre that is outside Abuja, in the event we experience loss of any data. “The only thing that happened to the data centre is the cooling unit which is in the exterior at the back. The cooling unit will be put in order,” he noted, saying that the unit has been closed temporarily. Meanwhile the FCT police commissioner, Bala Ciroma, who also briefed journalists at the scene of the incident, said an investigation into the cause of the fire had commenced. The minister alluded to this, too. He said while “a few documents were burnt,” the extent of the damages is yet to be ascertained.”",Trudeau Bought His Mother A Car Using WE Charity Funds – Conservative…,TRUE

a4c2af21,"More nurses and midwives are leaving the profession in the UK than joining it, for the first time since 2008, figures show. The number registered in the UK fell by 1,783 to 690,773, in the year to March. The Nursing and Midwifery Council NMC said the downward trend had been most pronounced among British workers. Many leavers cited working conditions. But the government said there were now 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals in England than in 2010. In April and May this year, there was a more dramatic fall in those leaving nursing and midwifery, with a further 3,264 workers going. Other than retirement, the main reasons given for leaving were working conditions - including staffing levels and workload - personal circumstances and disillusion with quality of care to patients, according to an NMC survey of more than 4,500 leavers. Other reasons included leaving the UK and poor pay and benefits. Boris Johnson joins calls to end pay cap 'I'm swapping nursing for botox' Saffron Cordery, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: These figures provide further evidence of the severe workforce problems NHS trusts face. This goes beyond the concerns over Brexit - worrying though they are. The reduction in numbers is most pronounced among UK registrants. And it is particularly disappointing to see so many of our younger nurses and midwives choosing to leave. She said a new staff retention programme would offer support to those NHS trusts with the highest leaving rates. However, until we address the underlying issues driving retention problems, including the pay cap and the unsustainable workplace pressures, these approaches will only have a limited impact. Nurses protesting against the pay capimage copyrightEPA image captionNurses protested against the 1% public sector pay cap in June line Analysis: Nick Triggle, BBC health correspondent The figures being flagged up by the Nursing and Midwifery Council are for those registered to work in the UK. That is, of course, important - without a ready supply, the NHS cannot recruit the staff it needs. But the figure that is perhaps of most interest to the public is how many are actually working in the health service - and whether that is enough. The Department of Health in England has made this point, highlighting figures showing there are more than 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals than there were in 2010. But if you look at the overall number working in the NHS - once you include the likes of district nurses and those working in mental health - the number has risen by only 5,000 to nearly 286,000. That is because the rise in hospital nurses has been partly offset by a fall elsewhere. What is more, if you consider the number the NHS wants to employ but cannot - by adding on the number of vacancies - you find that the health service is well short of what it needs. Earlier this year, research by the Royal College of Nursing showed there were 40,000 unfilled posts - double the number from three years ago. line The Royal College of Nursing RCN said poor working conditions and the vicious cycle of staffing levels had contributed to the number of nurses leaving the profession. RCN chief executive Janet Davies added that the NHS had resorted to a quick fix by bringing in people from overseas to fill the gap left by the lack of British nurses. She believes the decision on how much nurses are paid is political. She added: [The government is also] removing the funding of the training of our future nurses. In September it will be the first time we see nurses coming in and having to take a loan. We know that's put people off, we haven't seen the actual figures but we know it's really low in some places and of course that just went into savings. Nurses and midwives previously received bursaries during their studies, but the government announced it would cease the NHS bursaries system from 1 August 2017, meaning students in many healthcare fields will now have to repay the cost of their degrees. The RCN called on the government to scrap the 1% public sector pay cap as a matter of urgency to prevent more health workers leaving. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: We are making sure we have the nurses we need to continue delivering world-class patient care - that's why there are almost 13,100 more on our wards since May 2010 and 52,000 in training. We also know we need to retain our excellent nurses and earlier this week we launched a national programme to ensure nurses have the support they need to continue their vital work.","WADA ‘disappointed’ at missed Moscow lab deadline, but IOC chief offers Olympics hope",TRUE

4b28c12a,"(CNN) The stakes were high when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren met at Warren's apartment in Washington, DC, one evening in December 2018 . The longtime friends knew that they could soon be running against each other for president. The two agreed that if they ultimately faced each other as presidential candidates, they should remain civil and avoid attacking one another, so as not to hurt the progressive movement. They also discussed how to best take on President Donald Trump, and Warren laid out two main reasons she believed she would be a strong candidate: She could make a robust argument about the economy and earn broad support from female voters. Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win. The description of that meeting is based on the accounts of four people: two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting. After publication of this story, Warren herself backed up this account of the meeting, saying in part in a statement Monday, ""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed."" That evening in 2018, Sanders expressed frustration at what he saw as a growing focus among Democrats on identity politics, according to one of the people familiar with the conversation. Warren told Sanders she disagreed with his assessment that a woman could not win, three of the four sources said. Sanders denied the characterization of the meeting in a statement to CNN. ""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,"" Sanders said. ""It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."" Warren's communications director Kristen Orthman declined to comment. These previously unreported details from the two senators' private meeting shed new light on the careful efforts that Warren and Sanders appear to have made to manage their friendship and political rivalry even before the 2020 race was officially underway. From the start, even as both candidates were determined to capture the Democratic nomination, they were also keenly sensitive to the risk that their rivalry could divide the progressive movement. The conversation also illustrates the skepticism among not only American voters but also senior Democratic officials that the country is ready to elect a woman as president, several years after one clinched a major political party's nomination for president for the first time. Many Democrats believe sexism played a role in Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 general election, and voters say they are torn about whether to try again to put a woman in the White House in 2020. The revelation that Sanders expressed skepticism that Warren could win the presidency because she is a woman is particularly noteworthy now, given that Warren is the lone female candidate at the top of the Democratic field. And notably, their meeting in December 2018 came just weeks after a record number of women had been elected to the House of Representatives, helping to deliver the majority to the Democrats. Democrats have been intensely debating questions of identity and representation in recent years, and the party's historically diverse field of White House candidates this cycle has featured multiple women. Sanders himself weighed in shortly after the 2016 election, saying that ""one of the struggles that you're going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics."" ""I think it's a step forward in America if you have an African American CEO of some major corporation. But you know what, if that guy is going to be shipping jobs out of this country, and exploiting his workers, it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot whether he's black or white or Latino,"" he said at an appearance in Boston to promote his book, according to WBUR ""Name your favorite woman president"" Warren has grown increasingly vocal over the past few months on the role of sexism and gender inequality in politics, including experiences the Massachusetts Democrat said she has endured in the years that she has been in public office. On the campaign trail, Warren tells voters the story of how some male colleagues have advised her to ""smile more"" and being discouraged from running for Senate in 2012 because she was a woman. ""Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,"" Warren wrote in a campaign email in November, with the subject line: ""I am angry and I own it."" Three weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Warren is now the only woman polling in the double-digits nationally. A new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Warren in a four-way race in Iowa, along with Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. In that survey, Sanders and Warren performed nearly equally well as the top choice among female likely Democratic caucusgoers, while Sanders and Buttigieg were the top choice among men. Last month, Warren said in Las Vegas that she had ""lived enough of my life with men, and it's mostly been men, telling me to sit down and be quiet."" Days later, she acknowledged that this was a dynamic she had experienced in the current campaign. Warren's rivals have also grappled with the issue of sexism in politics. Biden recently said on the campaign trail that Clinton had confronted ""unfair"" sexist attacks in the last election, and added: ""That's not going to happen with me."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said recently that female candidates with as little political experience as Buttigieg would not have qualified for the presidential debate. ""Women are held to a higher standard,"" the Minnesota Democrat said. ""Otherwise we could play a game called 'Name Your Favorite Woman President,' which we can't do because it has all been men."" A fraying non-aggression pact The New York Times first reported over a year ago that Warren and Sanders met in Washington in December 2018. That initial report said that neither senator sought each other's support, and that they did not try to dissuade one another from running in the 2020 election. If Warren and Sanders agreed on a non-aggression pact of sorts that night, that agreement has become increasingly frayed. Over the last year, Sanders aides and advisers have taken to social media to criticize Warren on numerous issues, including ""Medicare for All,"" student loan debt cancelation and the ""wealth tax."" Some of his allies have also implicitly and explicitly gone after Warren on the broader question of who has the rightful claim to the progressive mantle in 2020. ""People have to decide do they want originals or do they want copies,"" Nina Turner, Sanders' campaign co-chair, told CNN over the summer. ""He's the original."" Politico reported over the weekend on the Sanders campaign's talking points instructing volunteers to say that Warren's supporters are ""highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what"" and that ""she's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party."" Campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa, Warren told reporters that she was ""disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me."" ""Bernie knows me, and has known me for a long time,"" Warren said. ""He knows who I am, where I come from, what I have worked on and fought for, and the coalition and grassroots movement we're trying to build."" Sanders himself appeared to distance himself from the memo, saying on Sunday that his campaign has ""hundreds of employees"" and that ""people sometimes say things that they shouldn't."" ""I have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine,"" Sanders said.

31e96704,"MOSCOW Sputnik — Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the publication about the alleged identity of Ruslan Boshirov, suspected by London of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, fake news aimed at diverting public attention from what happened in Salisbury. Earlier on Wednesday, UK investigating bloggers from Bellingcat in cooperation with the Insider Russia website, published material alleging that Boshirov is in fact a GRU colonel called Anatoly Chepiga. Previously, Bellingcat had already published materials that were not confirmed. A new portion of fake news about Petrov and Boshirov was presented immediately after the speech of [UK Prime Minister] Theresa May in the UN Security Council focusing on weapons of mass destruction, during which she repeated accusations against Russia. There is no evidence, so they continue the information campaign, the main task of which is to divert attention from the main question: 'What happened in Salisbury?' The question is: when will there be any evidence of the involvement of anyone, as London tells us, of poisoning in Salisbury? Zakharova wrote on Facebook. On September 5, UK prosecutors charged Russian citizens Boshirov and Alexander Petrov with attempted murder of the Skripals, as well as police officer Nick Bailey. Theresa May accused Russian military intelligence of orchestrating the poisoning under the order of the central authorities. However, in an interview with Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the RT broadcaster and the Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency, Boshirov and Petrov refuted any involvement in the Skripal case, stressing that they visited Salisbury as tourists and worked in the fitness industry. The Skripals were poisoned with what London claimed was the A234 nerve agent in Salisbury, the United Kingdom, in early March. The UK authorities have accused Russia of orchestrating the attack, but Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in it. London said earlier this month it had identified Russian nationals Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov as the suspects in the Salisbury attack. Moreover, UK Prime Minister Theresa May accused Russian military intelligence of orchestrating the poisoning under the order of the central authorities. Moscow responded that the photos and names of the suspects released by London did not prove its involvement in the attack.","Call it the divine rule of masks. You shall not utter a negative word about them. You shall never question their effectiveness, even when they've failed to work for six months. You shall never be caught without the idol on your face – even on the face of your two-year-old, for that matter. You shall worship the cloth until the bitter end. It doesn't take a scientist to see that masks don't work. The experience of unprecedented universal mask-wearing for months – even in places that had few COVID cases to begin with but then skyrocketed after mask use – demonstrates that the idea of wearing a mask to block a respiratory virus is sheer lunacy. Yet one group of researchers tried to cherry-pick data from a selected counties to show that cases dropped after the mask mandate, without any regard for the fact that each wave only lasts for about 6-8 weeks in a given area before dissipating – regardless of what actions are taken by the local population. Then it comes back a few times until everyone has been exposed to the virus. On October 23, researchers from MIT and the University of California San Francisco published a preprint study titled, ""Decrease in Hospitalizations for COVID-19 after Mask Mandates in 1083 U.S. Counties."" Somehow, we were to believe that these counties bucked the worldwide trend of cases spiking after a mask mandate. In reality, these were merely counties that likely already peaked in terms of the viral reproduction rate by the time the mandate was in place, so the cases were destined to drop anyway. That is, until the next natural wave. On November 4, they were forced to withdraw the study ""because there are increased rates of SARS- CoV-2 cases in the areas that we originally analyzed in this study."" Oops. I guess the masks worked until they didn't. It doesn't take a scientist to see that masks don't work.

I guess the masks worked until they didn't. The authors say they plan to publish ""an updated analysis using data from the second and now third wave of SARS-CoV-2 in this country soon."" However, the obvious fact is lost on them. The very fact that there are multiple waves demonstrates that this is a natural phenomenon and will keep going until it burns through the population regardless of what we put on our faces. When the virus is burning out in a given area, nothing can be done to rekindle it. Conversely, when it is spreading, no amount of ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" will arrest the spread. This is why proponents of the mask religion are resorting to fabricating data in order to demonstrate effectiveness while blocking the publication of any study, such as the large Danish randomized controlled trial, demonstrating that masks don't work. Then again, we don't need any fancy study to project or predict what we see with our eyes. The virus is spreading universally more than ever (because of the cold weather and seasonality) despite months of extremely unprecedented draconian mask-wearing and other voodoo restrictions. Nowhere is this more evident than in the military, where there is more compliance than you will ever experience in a civilian population, which itself has been remarkably obsequious on the mask issue. Last week, researchers for the Naval Medical Research Center in Maryland and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing how mask-wearing and social isolation failed to stop the spread among U.S. Marine Corps recruits at Parris Island. The over 3,000 participants were divided into two study groups, and those who tested positive up front were removed from the group on day 1. By day 14, spread was actually greater among those in the supervised quarantine group (2.8%) than in the control group (1.7%). What was the protocol for those in the quarantine group? All recruits wore double-layered cloth masks at all times indoors and outdoors, except when sleeping or eating; practiced social distancing of at least 6 feet; were not allowed to leave campus; did not have access to personal electronics and other items that might contribute to surface transmission; and routinely washed their hands. They slept in double-occupancy rooms with sinks, ate in shared dining facilities, and used shared bathrooms. All recruits cleaned their rooms daily, sanitized bathrooms after each use with bleach wipes, and ate preplated meals in a dining hall that was cleaned with bleach after each platoon had eaten. Most instruction and exercises were conducted outdoors. All movement of recruits was supervised, and unidirectional flow was implemented, with designated building entry and exit points to minimize contact among persons. All recruits, regardless of participation in the study, underwent daily temperature and symptom screening. Six instructors who were assigned to each platoon worked in 8-hour shifts and enforced the quarantine measures. This is everything that Dr. Fauci and the other fascists have asked for, right? Now, anyone who has been in military training can tell you that if a drill sergeant commands you to do something, you listen. This is doubly true for a protocol that is regarded with the upmost importance for public health. Yet the masks were worthless. Now extrapolate this for a civilian population. You will never obtain more control over a population and achieve a greater degree of compliance than in a group of Marine recruits, and these absurd measures failed miserably. Just like they failed with a group of Army recruits at Fort Benning. The good news is that the study also found that 90% of those infected among this predominantly young population were asymptomatic, consistent with other research. So why are we abusing children and young adults with tactics that don't work for a virus that is not dangerous to them? It's about control and idolatry. Except this form of idolatry requires more faith in cloth diapers than the men of cloth have in God.",FALSE
e89e364e,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement about Democrats’ plans to use the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending package to bailout wasteful states, like New York, Illinois and California, that want to use taxpayer money to backfill their poorly-managed budgets and pension plans. Senator Rick Scott said, “Senate Republicans are all in for getting targeted relief to Americans that are still hurting from this pandemic. But President Biden and the Democrats want to spend more than $350 billion to bailout their friends in New York, Illinois, and California. And they are lying about the need for this money. Congress has already given states roughly $400 billion to combat this crisis. States across the country are seeing increases in revenue — in some cases, well above projections. Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12 percent compared to 2019, and twenty-one of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois. “This is great news for our states – but Democrats don’t want you to know this. The Democrats have made it blatantly obvious that this isn’t about helping people – it’s a payback to their friends for helping with their campaigns. Less than two weeks into the Biden Administration and Democrats have already completely abandoned their inauthentic calls for ‘unity’ and ‘bipartisanship’ just to push through massive spending and get tax dollars to their buddies. You can’t make this stuff up. These wasteful states just have their hand out to the federal government in hopes that American taxpayers will plug the long-standing holes in their budgets and pension systems created by decades of mismanagement and the poor decisions of failed politicians. That’s not fair to Floridians and all the states around the country that have been working hard to protect taxpayer dollars. We can’t let it happen.” See more in Senator Scott’s interview with FOX News yesterday HERE. ###","A controversial Bill passed in Iran, it allows men to marry daughters, draws flak from other nations?",partially false
1f90007c,"Groups including the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization that challenges aspects of climate change, have called concerns about the bears overblown, arguing that some research shows that the animals have survived repeated warm periods. But scientists say during earlier warm periods the bears probably had significant alternative food sources, notably whales, that they do not have today. Poignant images of bears on isolated ice floes or roaming land in search of food have been used by conservation groups and others to showcase the need for action to reduce warming. Occasionally, though, these images have been shown to be not what they seem. After a video of an emaciated bear picking through garbage cans in the Canadian Arctic was posted online by National Geographic in 2017, the magazine acknowledged that the bear’s condition might not be related to climate change. Scientists had pointed out that there was no way of knowing what was wrong with the bear; it might have been sick or very old. The new study did not include projections in which emissions were reduced drastically, said Cecilia M. Bitz, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington and an author of the study. The researchers needed to be able to determine, as precisely as possible, the periods when sea ice would be gone from a particular region. “If we had wanted to look at many models we wouldn’t have been able to do that,” Dr. Bitz said. Andrew Derocher, a polar bear researcher at the University of Alberta who was not involved in the study, said the findings “are very consistent with what we’re seeing from empirical studies like monitoring work in the field.” “The study shows clearly that polar bears are going to do better with less warming,” he added. “But no matter which scenario you look at, there are serious concerns about conservation of the species.” Of the 19 subpopulations, little is known about some of them, particularly those in the Russian Arctic. Of subpopulations that have been studied, some — generally those in areas with less ice loss — have shown little population decline so far. But others, notably in the southern Beaufort Sea off northeastern Alaska, and in the western Hudson Bay in Canada, have been severely affected by loss of sea ice.","Killers could avoid whole life terms by pleading guilty, Sentencing Council suggests",TRUE

Almost three quarters of first-time buyers 72 per cent cited paying the upfront cost as more difficult than raising a deposit 69 per cent or making monthly mortgage payments 34 per cent. And 60 per cent of FTBs say paying no stamp duty would make them more likely to buy their own home, according to Yorkshire Building Society research. Saving enough to pay stamp duty adds to the overall difficulty of buying a home Andrew McPhillips The tax – paid from already taxed income for simply changing your address – is charged when people buy a home. Currently nothing is paid if he property bought is less than £125,000, but two per cent is charged on the portion up to £250,000. Five per cent is then charged up to £925,000, 10 per cent up to £1.5m and 12 per cent on anything above that. So a house bought for £275,000 comes with a bill of £3,750 made up of zero per cent on the first £125,000, then two per cent on the next £125,000, equaling £2,500 and five per cent or £1,250 on the final £25,000. Now the Yorkshire is calling on the Chancellor to swap the payment of the tax from the buyer to the seller in tomorrow’s Autumn Statement. The Society estimates such a reform would save first-time buyers in the UK excluding Scotland, an average of £3,791, with Londoners saving the most at an average of £13,171. But other experts, such as the TaxPayers’ Alliance would like to see the tax scrapped completely. John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Stamp Duty is a bad tax which not only distorts the housing market by adding an extra cost on already unmanageably high house prices but also affects labour mobility by preventing people from taking up jobs across the country, worsening our productivity as a nation.

Sixty per cent of aspiring homeowners said paying no stamp duty would make them more likely to move, with 22 per cent saying it would not make a difference and the remaining 18 per cent answering ‘don’t know’. The research showed that 18 per cent of potential first time buyers were not saving anything towards buying a home, and a further 52 per cent saving less than £250 per month. GETTY More than half first time buyers would be more likely to buy a home if stamp duty was axed The Society argues this highlights the significance of stamp duty acting as a barrier to people achieving their homeownership aspirations. It has urged the Government to include examining the switch in stamp duty as part of its formal submission on what should be included in Mr Hammond’s financial plans for the UK. Andrew McPhillips, chief economist at Yorkshire Building Society, said: “Saving enough to pay stamp duty adds to the overall difficulty of buying a home. “It’s hard enough for buyers to find the right property in the right location without the need to pay additional fees and taxes, given the scale of house price inflation in recent years. “The Government’s Housing White Paper will rightly outline plans to resolve the crisis faced by those unable to buy a home. GETTY Paying stamp duty was more difficult than raising a deposit for 69% of respondents “But these will be long-term ambitions and measures to ease the problems in the short-term, including reforming stamp duty, should form part of the Government’s strategy. “Reducing any of the costs such as stamp duty for first time buyers and those moving up the ladder would help to make homes more affordable for many, enabling more people to realise their homeownership aspirations.” According to another new study, the Chancellor needs to cut the housing tax to stop the North continuing to suffer a “brain drain” as high-skilled British workers leave the region in their thousands.

5a2459c3,"A measure to limit Florida school board member terms has gained the support of the two men seeking the Republican nomination to become the state's next governor. They did not weigh in, though, on the other two provisions the concept is tied to as it heads to the November ballot. U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Jacksonville Republican in his third term, isn't one to talk much about Florida-specific issues. He did, however, take time to publicize his position on school board term limits, perhaps the most popular of the three ideas in the constitutional amendment. It also asks voters to require civics literacy program in public schools, and to allow the Legislature to create new education models outside the control of local school boards. ""No elected office, whether federal or local, is ever better off when run by career politicians,"" DeSantis, a three-term House member from Jacksonville, wrote in a piece for the U.S. Term Limits website. ""That's why I support eight-year term limits for all school board members,"" continued DeSantis, who also has sponsored legislation to limit Congressional terms. ""I am confident this proposal would bring new energy and ideas to school boards, which too often suffer from the same untamed incumbency that paralyzes Congress."" Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, by most accounts a the candidate more likely to focus on policy details, shared that point of view. ""If term limits are good enough for the governor and the Legislature, they're good enough for school boards,"" Putnam said via email. Supporters of Amendment 8, the Constitution Revision Commission's education-focused ballot question, have focused attention on the term limits portion. The new political committee backing the measure this week referred to the proposal in its press release as being about ""school board term limits and other K-12 policy."" It's that ""other"" part that has opponents most concerned. They have taken to social media to complain that the section ""amending Section 4 of Article IX of the State Constitution to specify which schools are operated, controlled, and supervised by a school board"" could establish a second level of public schools run without local control, with appointed boards based in Tallahassee or elsewhere. The original language, before the Constitution Revision Commission amended it, spoke directly of a state charter school authorizer.

97b3e15c,"Denying 2000 years of the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age on every continent Here we go again. For five or so years believers didn’t really mention the Medieval Warm Period. Too bruised by the embarrassment of Hockey Stick Zombie failures. But it’s an inconvenient era they have to rub out because none of the expert models can explain what caused it, and it’s hard to panic about same temperatures that Edward the Confessor survived with oxen and carts. And it’s hard to call the modern warmth “man-made” if nature created something just like it 1,000 years ago. By Michael Collett, ABC, Environmental Copy and Paste Promoter Climate scientists writing in the journal Nature have found there is no evidence for “globally coherent warm and cold periods” over the past 2,000 years prior to industrialisation. That’s significant, because climate change deniers have sometimes pointed to epochs like the so-called “Little Ice Age” or “Medieval Warm Period” to argue that the current global warming is one among multiple similar global climate events. But what the research actually shows is that other “peak warming and cooling events” over the past two millennia appear to have been localised, whereas the human-caused global warming observed over the past 150 years is unparalleled in its global scale (not to mention its absolute temperatures). Who’s denying a million raw data points? This new global temperature reconstruction by The Pages Consortium miraculously agrees with the models yet disagrees with hundreds of stalagmites, corals, ice cores, trees, lake sediments, mud from the ocean floor, pollen dust and 6,000 boreholes. It disagrees with the history of peoples like the Vikings. It disagrees with plants that grew and with trees that survived “above the snowline” that shouldn’t. This map shows just some temperature estimates from all around the world during medieval times relative to today. Many of these papers come from Craig Idso at CO2Science.org who maintains the Medieval Warm Period Project. Back in 2009 when I did this map for the Skeptics Handbook II it was a first. Even then, there were already 442 separate research institutes from 41 countries which had published papers showing the MWP.* Also thanks to Luning and Vahrenholt, and the team at NoTricksZone. The latest paper is trying to claim that all these temperatures were not recorded at the same time and that it wasn’t global. But when proxies are combined it’s obvious it was. Even in our modern warm period, there are still warm and cold records being set at the same time. Medieval times were no different. It’s only by collating and combining many proxies that we can see “the average”. 18 proxies tell us the world was the same or warmer 1,000 years ago Craig Loehle in 2008 used 18 non-tree-ring proxies which included Greenland borehole data, Conroy lake pollen, isotopes from Chesapeake Bay, Sargasso Sea, Caribbean Sea, results from caves in South Africa, the Swiss Alps, Sea Surface reconstructions from Norway, the northern Pacific and the South Atlantic and other proxies too. Temperatures were higher 1000 years ago, and cooler 300 years ago. We started warming long before cars and powerstations were invented. There’s little correlation with CO2 levels. Here’s what 120 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere tell us Ljungqvist et al combined 120 proxies of all different kinds and found this pattern for the last 12 centuries across the Northern Hemisphere. Then there’s Christiansen et al 2012 who followed 32 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere back to the year 0 AD. Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in China Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in Antarctica, and the Little Ice Age: Just in case you thought there wasn’t enough from the Southern Hemisphere. Rosenthal et al 2013 put out quite the zinger of a paper. They’ve reconstructed the temperature of the water flowing out of the Pacific to the Indian Ocean over the last 10,000 years and as deep as 900m. The Indonesian Throughflow is pretty significant in global ocean currents. Clearly that water was warmer 1000 years ago than it was circa 1970. It was even warmer again in the Holocene. 3000 hot and cold years in a South African cave South African Cave last 3000 years Source: Holmgren 2001. See also here and here in African reconstructions. The Southern Ocean 7000 year record also shows long term cooling as well as the Roman Warm Period. Then there’s 10,000 mostly hotter years in Greenland No paleoclimate discussion is complete without GISP: 6,000 Boreholes show it was global Just some of the places these boreholes have been dug. They stick a thermometer down a hole, and all over the world there is a pattern that repeats as temperature changes on the surface travel gradually down through the rocks. Sure, the resolution is bare bones. The data is “smoothed”. We can’t use boreholes to know if things were warmer than today and we can’t tell how long ago that big last surge in warmth was, but where boreholes come into their own is in showing us just how global that last big warm spell was. Below is the latest iteration of a graph that went through a savage evolution from 1997 – 2008. What stayed constant was that boreholes always showed a medieval warm period and a little ice age, that is, except for the time Huang et al “lost” nearly 20,000 years of data. In the graph above, if the assumption about the speed of heat flow is shifted to line up the coolest point with other proxies in 1680 and the warmest point to somewhere around 1000 – 1200 the amplitude would increase (see the jaw dropping 1997 original paper which claimed it was much warmer in medieval times). These papers are by no means the only important ones. There are so many others… So go tell the world — everywhere we look the world was hotter and colder in the last 1000 years, the last 10,000 years and the last billion. h/t George, David B, Original Steve, Peter Fitzroy.

f6e63818,"For the last four years, the Obama administration has provided funding and incentives for states to help build a teaching profession that is both respected and rigorous. Today, we're starting to see that investment pay off -- in expanded collaboration among teachers and improved performance among students. More teachers today are treated as true professionals, instead of as interchangeable cogs in an educational assembly line. Exhibit A: Tennessee. Tennessee -- one of the first two states to win a federal Race to the Top grant -- recently released an important report on the first year of implementing its new teacher evaluation system. The report found that after one year, Tennessee's students made their biggest single-year jump in achievement ever recorded in the state. That is a remarkable accomplishment. During the first two years of the Race to the Top grant, from 2010 to 2012, an additional 55,000 students in Tennessee were at or above grade level in math and 38,000 additional students were at or above grade level in science. But Tennessee's story also shows that reforming antiquated practices for evaluating teachers is hard, ongoing work -- work that is far from finished. Few would dispute that the existing system for evaluating teacher performance is broken. Principals typically evaluate teachers' performance based on infrequent and informal observations and fail to take account of a teacher's impact on student learning. Great teachers are not recognized or rewarded. And struggling teachers neither get the feedback nor the professional assistance they need to improve. Under the old Tennessee system, tenured teachers were evaluated just twice a decade. A teacher's impact on student growth did not factor at all into their performance evaluation. Not surprisingly, virtually all teachers received positive ratings. Even so, many skeptics protested after Tennessee enacted a state law in 2010 that required 50 percent of a teacher's evaluation be based on student achievement data -- 35 percent on student growth, with the other 15 percent based on other measures of student achievement. The remaining 50 percent of the evaluation would be based on traditional qualitative measures, like observations of teachers by their principals. The initial blowback to implementing the law was considerable. Critics argued that test score gains were too imperfect a measure to use in teacher evaluation. Others said that for teachers in non-tested subjects like music or fine arts, it was unfair to base part of the evaluation on school-wide math and English test results. A New York Times reporter lampooned the new system, intoning, ""in the end, it's all about distrust: not trusting principals to judge teachers, not trusting teachers to educate children."" But the Tennessee department of education didn't ignore the critics of the new evaluation systems -- in fact, it listened to them and sought their feedback. Department officials met with 7,500 teachers around the state and surveyed 16,000 teachers and 1,000 administrators for input on the new evaluation system. In Memphis, arts teachers were frustrated because they were being evaluated based in part on school-wide performance in math and English. So Dru Davison, a music teacher in Memphis, convened a group of arts educators to come up with a fairer system. After surveying arts teachers in Memphis, Davison's committee developed a blind peer review evaluation to assess portfolios of student learning in the arts. It has proved so popular that Tennessee is looking at adopting the system statewide. As a result of the feedback the state received -- and with the benefit of real evidence of teacher impact on growth in student learning from almost 20,000 teachers -- the department recommended a number of changes to the teacher evaluation system. Their recently released report, for example, recommends that teachers who receive top scores should have a more streamlined evaluation the following year -- while teachers with low scores should receive additional observations and feedback from their principals. What are some of the takeaway lessons from Tennessee's experience? First, student growth can and should be one of a number of measures in evaluating the performance of teachers -- and it's important not to ignore a teacher's impact on student learning just because it is difficult to measure. Better evaluation systems improve classroom instruction. Delaware, the other state to win a first-round Race to the Top grant, has also seen big increases in student achievement. Second, it's true that there is no perfect system of teacher evaluation, but Tennessee did not let the perfect become the enemy of the good. They insisted on asking the compared-to-what question -- how do the strengths and weaknesses of the new system compare to the old system? And finally, because rigorous teacher evaluation systems are still a work in progress, it is vital that school leaders and administrators continue to solicit feedback, learn from their mistakes, and make improvements. One example: Tennessee's report found that principals are still largely unwilling to give weak teachers in need of assistance a poor performance review. As Tennessee has shown, our children, our teachers, and our country will be better off when school leaders and educators finally undertake the challenging task of creating a meaningful and useful system for supporting and evaluating our nation's teachers. --Arne Duncan is the U.S. Secretary of Education",The Tennessee Story,partially false
1e4e73f8,"First Lady Melania Trump has been “looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country” while “doing a brilliant job” according to Julia Roberts, who also declared that former First Lady Michelle Obama “isn’t fit to clean to clean her toilet.”Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film, as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back. Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her, however she opened up about the differences between America’s most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. “Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women,” Julia Roberts said. “Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin.“
The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she “hates America.“ “I can’t even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country,” Canadian Celine Dion said, while complaining about the Trump presidency. “You’re wrong, Celine,” Julia Roberts fired back. “The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact, perhaps you really should.” Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who “threatened” to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far, a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. It’s all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left.","111 line increasing pressure on NHS, say leading doctors",FALSE

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, warned that foreign intelligence services might swoop in and recruit furloughed C.I.A. workers. That seemed a little paranoid, but then we’re talking about spies. The C.I.A.-doom scenario sounded a bit like the problems facing the cast of “Homeland” this season, except for the part where a member of Congress is a terrorist mole who falls in love with an intelligence agent who frequently fails to take her bipolar disorder medication. Reality in Washington has gotten so muddled that the land in “Homeland” is looking sort of attractive. On Wednesday, House Republicans pushed to refund bits and pieces of the government that the members particularly like, such as veterans and the National Guard. Also anything that lends itself to a dramatic press conference, such as national parks and cancer treatment for children. Since the House proposals are never going anywhere in the Senate, there’s a limit to what you want to know about what went on during the debate. Let’s summarize: Democrats: “Meaningless political theater!” Republicans: “Come to the table!” Coming to the table has now replaced strangling Obamacare as the most popular G.O.P. war cry. There is a longstanding political rule that when all else fails, you demand more talking. If you’re running for office against a guy who’s got 70 percent in the polls, it’s time to call for a debate. If you’re already having four debates, it’s time to call for six. “Why don’t we sit down and have a conference committee about how we’re going to fund the federal government?” demanded Representative Ander Crenshaw of Florida. Republicans have posed this question a lot, and it would be an excellent one if they were not the same folks who have spent the last half-year refusing to sit down and have a conference committee about the federal budget.","A significant finding from Washington State University shows that garlic is 100 times more effective than two popular antibiotics at fighting disease causing bacteria commonly responsible for foodborne illness. Their work was published recently in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy a follow-up to the author's previous research in Applied and Environmental Microbiology which conclusively demonstrated that garlic concentrate was effective in inhibiting the growth of C. jejuni bacteria. Garlic is probably nature's most potent food. It is one of the reasons people who eat the Mediterranean diet live such long healthy lives.

One of the most interesting of the recent findings is that garlic increases the overall antioxidant levels of the body. Scientifically known as Allium sativa, garlic has been famous throughout history for its ability to fight off viruses and bacteria. Louis Pasteur noted in 1858 that bacteria died when they were doused with garlic.

This spirit of contempt is worsened by oppressive security arrangements, wilfully designed to cow the public, and by regular instances of spectacular incompetence by airports and airlines. But now, for air travellers to Europe, an additional ingredient has been added to the already exhausting ordeal. This week more intensive passport checks have been introduced at immigration control points in airports throughout the EU’s border-free Schengen Area, including those such as Malaga in Spain that are enormously popular with British holidaymakers. Ostensibly brought in to counter terrorism these new checks are targeted at any passengers from countries which are outside the Schengen zone, such as the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic. TWITTER Queues like these have become commonplace at some airports We are now trapped in a vicious downward spiral On the face of it this greater scrutiny should be a welcome step. After all the lack of effective immigration controls is a prime cause of hostility towards the EU. The problem here has not been the principle of tougher border checks but their utterly cack-handed, inconsistent and sometimes farcical implementation. The fact is that the EU imposed this major change without ensuring that the resources and staff were in place to operate the new procedures efficiently. The result was all too predictable. In the past few days a host of major European airports have been plagued by horrendous delays at passport controls. At Lisbon in Portugal there was reported to be a three-hour wait yesterday for non-Schengen passengers to clear the checks, while at Schiphol in Amsterdam the time taken was up to four hours. The snaking, immobile queue of frustrated British passengers has become one of the compelling images of the summer. There is no unavoidable reason for this misery. The air travel industry and immigration authorities had plenty of notice to prepare for this new system, given that the formal EU regulation on non-Schengen checks was passed by the European Commission in December 2015, 18 months ago.

Few extra personnel seem to have been recruited or adjustments made to outdated operating methods. “There were just four guys standing in only one booth at passport control. I felt that they were punishing UK residents,” complained one passenger at Palma airport in Mallorca. That traveller may have hit on an essential truth about this week’s airport paralysis. The delays could be due not to any organisational ineptitude or determination to enhance security but to a politicised desire to indulge in a form of collective humiliation and denigration of the British. In the mindset of EU ideologues and their agents, in voting for Brexit we committed the sin of challenging the creed of the superstate. Now we must pay the price for our heresy. European countries could inflict real damage on their tourist industries if they continue to make journeys so unpleasant. But the lesson of the EU is that integrationist dogma trumps everything else. GETTY/TWITTER Passengers reported queuing for up to four at airports across Europe To the EU enthusiasts, bullying Britain counts far more than generating income from tourism. That impulse to punish can be seen time and again since Brexit, such as in the ridiculous demand for a so-called £80billion “divorce” payment. Yet the most absurd aspect of the border mayhem is the contrast with the EU’s pathetic refusal to maintain any proper controls against the continuing flood of migrants from North Africa, the Middle East and Asia. There is not a shred of consistency or morality in the stance of Brussels. While law-abiding British passengers are held up for hours at airports, a vast influx of non-European migrants are welcomed with no questions asked. Indeed, far from having to undergo surly invigilation like the British, tens of thousands of Africans are provided with a free ferry service that takes them from the Libya coast on a journey of 300 miles to Italy. In one day alone last month 4,400 migrants were brought to Italian ports this way, part of a tidal wave of 500,000 Africans who have reached Italy over the past three years.

ae6a2bd1,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Today, I report on a Britain that is growing, creating jobs and paying its way. We took difficult decisions in the teeth of opposition and it worked - Britain is walking tall again. Five years ago, our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country. Today, I can confirm: in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world. Five years ago, millions of people could not find work. Today, I can report: more people have jobs in Britain than ever before. Five years ago, living standards were set back years by the Great Recession. Today, the latest projections show that living standards will be higher than when we came to office. Five years ago, the deficit was out of control. Today, as a share of national income it is down by more than a half. Five years ago, we were bailing out the banks. Today, I can tell the House: we’re selling more bank shares and getting taxpayers’ money back. We set out a plan. That plan is working. Britain is walking tall again. So Mr Deputy Speaker, the critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let’s go on working through the plan that is delivering for you? Today we make that critical choice: we choose the future. We choose, as the central judgement of this Budget, to use whatever additional resources we have to get the deficit and the debt falling. No unfunded spending. No irresponsible extra borrowing. For no short term giveaway can ever begin to help people as much as the long term benefits of a recovering national economy. In the Emergency Budget I presented to this House 5 years ago I said we would turn Britain around – and in this last Budget of the Parliament we will not waiver from that task. For we choose the future. Our goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous major economy in the world, with that prosperity widely shared. So we choose economic security. This Budget commits us to the difficult decisions to eliminate our deficit and get our national debt share falling. We choose jobs. This Budget does more to back business and make work pay, so we create full employment. We choose the whole nation. The Budget makes new investments in manufacturing and science and the northern powerhouse for a truly national recovery. We choose responsibility. This Budget takes further action to support savers and pensioners. We choose aspiration. This Budget backs the self-employed, the small business-owner and the homebuyer. We choose families. This Budget helps hard-working people keep more of the money they have earned. This is a Budget that takes Britain one more big step on the road from austerity to prosperity. We have a plan that is working – and this is a Budget that works for you. Economic forecasts Mr Deputy Speaker, the British economy is fundamentally stronger than it was five years ago – and that is reflected in the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Today, figures are produced with independence and integrity by Robert Chote and his team, and I thank them for their work. The OBR confirm today that at 2.6%, Britain grew faster than any other major advanced economy in the world last year. That is fifty per cent faster than Germany, three times faster than the euro-zone – and seven times faster than France. There are some who advise us to abandon our plan and pursue the French approach. I prefer to follow the advice the Secretary General of the OECD gave us all last month: “Britain has a long term economic plan – and it needs to stick with it” “A long term economic plan” – now there’s someone with a way with words. We need to stick with that plan at a time when global economic risks are rising. The biggest development since the Autumn Statement has been the further sharp fall in the world oil price. This is positive news for the global economy. But the overall boost this provides has not yet offset the rising geo-political uncertainty it causes. And the Eurozone continues to stagnate. So at this Budget, the OBR have once again revised down the growth of the world economy, revised down the growth of world trade and revised down the prospects for the Eurozone. And they warn us that the current stand-off with Greece could be very damaging to the British economy. I agree with that assessment. A disorderly Greek exit from the euro remains the greatest threat to Europe’s economic stability. It would be a serious mistake to underestimate its impact on the UK, and we urge our Eurozone colleagues to resolve the growing crisis. The problems in Europe remind us why Britain needs to expand our links with the faster growing parts of the world. We’ve made major progress this Parliament. I can report that the trade deficit figures published last week are the best for 15 years. And we will do even more – so today I am again increasing UKTI’s resources to double the support for British exporters to China. We have also decided to become the first major western nation to be a prospective founding member of the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, because we think you should be present at the creation of these new international institutions. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would expect weaker world growth, weaker world trade and weaker European growth to lead to weaker growth here in the UK. However, the OBR haven’t revised down Britain’s economic forecasts – they have revised them up. A year ago, they forecast growth in 2015 at 2.3%. In the Autumn Statement that was revised up to 2.4%. Today, I can confirm GDP growth this year is forecast to be higher still, at 2.5%. It is also revised up next year, to 2.3%. That is where it remains for the following two years, before reaching 2.4% in 2019. So the OBR report growth revised up – and their numbers confirm that growth is broadly based. For we are replacing the disastrous economic model we inherited. Between 1997 and 2010, investment accounted for less than one fifth of Britain’s economic growth – four fifths came from debt-fuelled household consumption. Meanwhile manufacturing halved as a share of our national economy, and the gap between the North and South grew ever larger. I can report since 2010: Business investment has grown four times faster than household consumption. Britain’s manufacturing output has grown more than four and a half times faster than it did in the entire decade before the crisis. And over the last year, the North grew faster than the South. We are seeing a truly national recovery. Employment Mr Deputy Speaker let me turn now to the rest of the forecasts. This morning we saw the latest jobs numbers. It is a massive moment. Britain has the highest rate of employment in its history. A record number of people in work. More women in work than ever before. And the claimant count rate is at its lowest since 1975. For years governments have talked about full employment – the government is moving towards achieving it. Unemployment today has fallen by another 100,000. And compared to the Autumn Statement, the OBR now expect unemployment this year to be even lower. It is set to fall to 5.3% - down almost a whole 3 percentage points from 2010. When we set out our plan, people predicted that a million jobs would be lost. Instead, over 1.9 million new jobs have been gained. Because our long term plan is based on the premise that if you provide economic stability, if you reform welfare and make work pay, and if you back business, then you will create jobs too. Today’s figures show that since 2010, 1000 more jobs have been created every single day. The evidence is plain to see – Britain is working. And Mr Deputy Speaker, what about those who say “the jobs aren’t real jobs; they’re all part time; they’re all in London.” Nonsense. How many of the jobs are full time? 80% How many of the jobs are in skilled occupations? 80% And where is employment growing fastest? The North West. Where is a job being created every ten minutes? The Midlands. And which county has created more jobs than the whole of France? The great county of Yorkshire We are getting the whole of Britain back to work with a truly national recovery. Living standards Mr Deputy Speaker, it is only by growing our economy, dealing with our debts and creating jobs, that we can raise living standards. To the question of whether people are better off at the end of this Parliament than they were five years ago we can give the resounding answer “yes” You can measure it by GDP per capita, and the answer is yes – up by 5% Or you can use the most up-to-date and comprehensive measure of living standards which is Real Household Disposable Income per capita. In other words, how much money families have to spend after inflation and tax. It is the living standards measure used by the Office for National Statistics and by the OECD. On that measure I can confirm, on the latest OBR data today, living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010. And it confirms they are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade. The British people for years paid the heavy price of the great recession. Now, the facts show households on average will be around £900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 – and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis anymore, but is instead growing and creating jobs. Mr Deputy Speaker because we have strong growth and a strong economy we can also afford real increases in the National Minimum Wage. This week we accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission that the National Minimum Wage should rise to £6.70 this autumn, on course for a minimum wage that will be over £8 by the end of the decade. And we’ve agreed the biggest increase ever in the apprentice rate. It’s the oldest rule of economic policy. It’s the lowest paid who suffer most when the economy fails and it’s the lowest paid who benefit when you turn that economy around. Inflation Mr Deputy Speaker household incomes also go further because we now have the lowest inflation on record. The OBR today revise down their forecast for inflation this year to just 0.2%, and revise it down for the following three years. It is driven by falling world oil and food prices. Not by the kind of stagnation we have seen on the continent. But we will remain vigilant. I am today confirming that the remit for the Monetary Policy Committee for the coming year remains the 2% symmetric CPI inflation target. And I am also confirming the remit for our new Financial Policy Committee too, so that this time we spot the financial risks in advance. The fall in food prices is good for families; but it reminds us of the challenge our farmers face from volatile markets. The National Farmers Union have long argued they should be allowed to average their incomes for tax purposes over five years; I agree and in this Budget we will make that change. We will also use this opportunity to lock in the historically low interest rates for the long term. I can tell the House that we will increase the number of long-dated gilts that we sell. We’ll also redeem the last remaining undated British Government bonds in circulation. We’ll have paid off the debts incurred in the South Sea Bubble, the First World War, the debt issued by Henry Pelham, George Goschen and William Gladstone. And Mr Deputy Speaker, since the pound goes further these days, now is a good time to confirm the design of the new one pound coin. Based on the brilliant drawing submitted by 15 year old David Pearce, a school pupil from Walsall, the new 12 sided pound coin will incorporate emblems from all four nations – for we are all part of one United Kingdom. Banks and debt Mr Deputy Speaker, I now turn to the national debt. Lower unemployment means less welfare. Compared to the Autumn Statement, welfare bills are set to be an average of £3 billion a year lower. Lower inflation means lower interest charges on government gilts; those interest charges are now expected to be almost £35 billion lower than just a few months ago. Rising unemployment, and compounding debt interest, contributed to our national debt problem. But they weren’t the only cause. It sent the national debt rocketing up by a third. We have already sold the branches of Northern Rock; and raised £9 billion from Lloyds shares. Now we go further. Today I can announce that we are launching a sale of £13 billion of the mortgage assets we still hold from the bailouts of Northern Rock and of Bradford and Bingley. Lloyds bank has returned to profit and is paying a dividend – so we can continue our exit from that bailout too. We will sell at least a further £9 billion of Lloyds shares in the coming year. The bank sales, lower debt interest and lower welfare bills presents us with a choice. We could treat it as a windfall, even though we know the public finances need further repair. And with an election looming, some of my immediate predecessors may have been tempted to do this. But that would be deeply irresponsible. We’d be spending money we didn’t really have. Racking up borrowing our country couldn’t afford. We’d be repeating all the mistakes the last government made – instead of fixing those mistakes. So today, the central judgement of this Budget is this: we will use the resources from the bank sales and the lower interest payments and the lower welfare bills to pay down the national debt. We put economic security first. For higher national debt leaves our nation exposed, harms potential growth and costs taxpayers billions of pounds in debt interest. That would be throwing away billions of pounds we should be using to fund our public services and lower taxes. Five years ago, national debt was soaring. That’s why in my first Budget I set a target that we would have national debt falling as a share of GDP by 2015-16, the last year of this Parliament. The Eurozone crisis made that task here at home all the more difficult, and for much of the last five years it looked like we might fall short. I can announce this to the House: The hard work and sacrifice of the British people has paid off. The original debt target I set out in my first Budget has been met. We will end this Parliament with Britain’s national debt share falling The sun is starting to shine – and we are fixing the roof. So the OBR report today that debt as a share of GDP falls from 80.4% in 2014-15; to 80.2% in the year 2015-16. And it keeps falling to 79.8% in 2016-17; then down to 77.8% the following year, to 74.8% in 2018-19 before it reaches 71.6% in 2019-20. Mr Deputy Speaker, national debt as a share of our national income has been increasing every single year since 2001. Those thirteen years amount to the longest year-on-year rise in our national debt since the end of the seventeenth century. Today we bring that record to an end. And there’s a consequence for our fiscal plans. Because the national debt share is falling a year earlier than forecast at the Autumn Statement – the squeeze on public spending ends a year earlier too. In the final year of this decade, 2019-20, public spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy. We can do that while still running a healthy surplus to bear down on our debt. A state neither smaller than we need; nor bigger than we can afford. For those interested in the history of these things, that will mean state spending as a share of our national income the same size as Britain had in the year 2000. That’s the year before spending got out of control and the national debt started its inexorable rise. Deficit Mr Deputy Speaker, when we came to office, the deficit stood at more than ten per cent of our national income – one of the highest of any major advanced economy and the largest in our peacetime history. The IMF says we’ve achieved the largest, most sustained reduction in our structural deficit of any major economy. Today, the OBR confirm that it now stands at less than half of the deficit we inherited. But at 5% this year, it’s still far too high – and it must come down. With our plan it does. The deficit falls to 4% in 2015-16; then down to 2% the following year; and down again to 0.6% the year after that. The deficit is lower in every year than at the Autumn Statement. In 2018-19, Britain will have a budget surplus of 0.2%; followed by a forecast surplus of 0.3% in 2019-20. We will also comfortably meet our fiscal mandate and Britain will be running a surplus for the first time in 18 years. That leads to borrowing. Every one of the borrowing numbers is lower than at the Autumn Statement too. We inherited annual borrowing of over £150 billion from the last government. This year borrowing is set to fall to £90.2 billion; a billion lower than expected at the Autumn Statement. It falls again in 2015-16 to £75.3 billion; then £39.4 billion the year after that, before falling to £12.8 billion – in total that’s £5 billion less borrowing than we forecast just three months ago. In 2018-19, we reach an overall surplus of £5.2 billion – a £1 billion improvement compared to December. In 2019-20 we are forecast to run a surplus of £7 billion. So growth is up. Unemployment is down. Borrowing is down in every year of the forecast. We reach a surplus. All contributing to a national debt now falling as a share of national income. Out of the red and into the black – Britain is back paying its way in the world. Spending Mr Deputy Speaker, lower borrowing and falling debt as a share of GDP will only continue with a credible plan to control public spending and welfare. As we end the Parliament, we can measure the scale of the achievement. The administrative costs of central government will be down by 40%. We have legislated for welfare savings of over £21 billion a year. And because savings have been driven by efficiency and reform, the quality of public services has not gone down – it’s gone up. Satisfaction with the NHS is rising year on year. Crime is down 20%. One million more children attend good or outstanding schools. But the job of repairing our public finances is not done. And here’s a very important point the country needs to understand. National debt as a share of GDP is now falling. We’ll only keep it falling if we commit to the fiscal path set out in this Budget. If we deviate from this path, if we go slower or borrow more, the national debt share will not keep falling – it will start rising again. After all the hard work of the British people over the last 5 years to reach this point, that reversal would be a tragedy. Britain is on the right track; we mustn’t turn back And in order to deliver that falling debt share we need to achieve the £30 billion further savings that are necessary by 2017-18. I am clear exactly how that £30 billion can be achieved. £13 billion from government departments. £12 billion from welfare savings. £5 billion from tax avoidance, evasion and aggressive tax planning. We have done it in this Parliament; we can do it in the next. Fairness The distributional analysis we publish today confirms that that the decisions since 2010 mean the rich are making the biggest contribution to deficit reduction. I said we would all be in this together and here is the proof. Compared to five years ago: Inequality is lower. Child poverty is down. Youth unemployment is down. Pensioner poverty is at its lowest level ever. The gender pay gap has never been smaller. Payday loans are capped. And zero hours contracts regulated. Even more than this, opportunity has increased; the number of university students from disadvantaged backgrounds is at a record high, apprenticeships have doubled and there are fewer workless households than ever before. And in this Budget we are providing funding for a major expansion of mental health services for children and those suffering from maternal mental illness. Those who suffer from these illnesses have been forgotten for too long. Not anymore. We stand for opportunity for all. And we have created a fairer tax system. Further proof we are all in this together. The share of income tax paid by the top 1% of taxpayers is projected to rise from 25% in 2010 to over 27% this year – that is higher than any one of the thirteen years of the last government. We’re getting more money from the people paying the top rate of tax. Because we understand that if you back enterprise, you raise more revenue. And the House will also want to know this – the lower paid 50% of taxpayers now pay a smaller proportion of income tax than at any time under the previous government. We are delivering a truly national recovery. Tax avoidance Mr Deputy Speaker in this Budget everything we spend will be paid for and this requires the following decisions. We have already taken steps to curb the size of the very largest pension pots. But the gross cost of tax relief has continued to rise through this Parliament, up almost £4 billion. That is not sustainable. So from next year, we will further reduce the Lifetime Allowance from £1.25 million to £1 million. This will save around £600 million a year. Fewer than 4% of pension savers currently approaching retirement will be affected. However, I want to ensure those still building up their pension pots are protected from inflation, so from 2018 we will index the Lifetime Allowance. We have had representations that we should also restrict the Annual Allowance for pensions and use the money to cut tuition fees. I have examined this proposal. It involves penalising moderately-paid, long-serving public servants, including police officers, teachers and nurses, and instead rewarding higher paid graduates. In 2010, city bankers boasted of paying lower tax rates than their cleaners; the rich routinely avoided stamp duty; and foreigners paid no capital gains tax. We’ve changed all that – and it was this Prime Minister who put tackling international tax evasion at the top of the agenda at the G8. We will now legislate for the new Common Reporting Standard we have got agreed around the world. Our new Diverted Profits Tax is aimed at large multinationals who artificially shift their profits offshore. I can confirm that we will legislate for it next week and bring it into effect at the start of next month. I am also today amending corporation tax rules to prevent contrived loss arrangements. And we’ll no longer allow businesses to take account of foreign branches when reclaiming VAT on overheads – making the system simpler and fairer. We will close loopholes to make sure Entrepreneurs Relief is only available to those selling genuine stakes in businesses. We will issue more accelerated payments notices to those who hold out from paying the tax that is owed. And we will stop employment intermediaries exploiting the tax system to reduce their own costs by clamping down on the agencies and umbrella companies who abuse tax reliefs on travel and subsistence – while we protect those genuinely self-employed. Taken together, all the new measures against tax avoidance and evasion will raise £3.1 billion over the forecast period. I can also tell the House that we will conduct a review on the avoidance of inheritance tax through the use of deeds of variation. It will report by the autumn. We will seek a wide range of views. Mr Deputy Speaker, my RHF the Chief Secretary will tomorrow publish further details of our comprehensive plans for new criminal offences for tax evasion and new penalties for those professionals who assist them. Let the message go out: this country’s tolerance for those who will not pay their fair share of taxes has come to an end. Banks Because we seek a truly national recovery, today I also ask our banking sector to contribute more. Financial services are one of Britain’s most important and successful industries, employing people in every corner of the country. We take steps to promote competition, back FinTech and encourage new business like global reinsurance. But as our banking sector becomes more profitable again, I believe they can make a bigger contribution to the repair of our public finances. I am today raising the rate of the bank levy to 0.21 per cent. This will raise an additional £900 million a year. We will also stop banks from deducting from corporation tax the compensation they make to customers for products they have been mis-sold, like PPI. Taken together these new banking taxes will raise £5.3 billion across the forecast. The banks got support going into the crisis; now they must support the whole country as we recover from the crisis. Libor and charities Mr Deputy Speaker, in each Budget we have used the LIBOR fines paid by those who demonstrated the very worst values to support those who represent the very best of British values. Today I can announce a further £75 million of help. Last week’s service of commemoration reminded us all of the debt we owe to those brave British servicemen and women who served in Afghanistan. We will provide funds to the regimental charities of every regiment that fought in that conflict; and we will contribute funding to the permanent memorial to those who died there and in Iraq. And in the 75th anniversary year of the Battle of Britain we will help to renovate the RAF museum at Hendon, the Stow Maries Airfield and the Biggin Hill Chapel Memorial so future generations are reminded of the sacrifice of our airmen in all conflicts. We will provide £25 million to help our eldest veterans, including nuclear test veterans. Many members on this side have also written to me asking for support for their local air ambulances. We’ve backed brilliant local charities in the past, and we do so again today – with funds for new helicopters for the Essex & Herts, East Anglian, Welsh and Scottish air ambulances, and for the Lucy Air Ambulance that transports children requiring urgent care. Our blood bike charities also do an incredible job. I am today responding to the public campaign and refunding their VAT. We’ll also set aside £1 million to help buy defibrillators for public places, including schools, and support training in their use to save more lives. Talking about people who save lives, and who sometimes sacrifice their own life to do so, we will also correct the historic injustice to spouses of police officers, firefighters, and members of the intelligence services who lose their lives on duty. And there’s additional money today to support the fight against terrorism. The £15 million Church Roof Fund I set aside at the Autumn Statement to support church roof appeals has been heavily oversubscribed – so I am today more than trebling it. Apparently, we’re not the only people who want to fix the roof when the sun is shining. Every weekend thousands of people go out and raise sums for their local charities across Britain through sponsored events and high-street collections. I am significantly extending the scheme I introduced that allows charities to claim automatic gift-aid on those donations – increasing it from the first £5,000 they raise to £8,000. That will benefit over 6,500 small charities. And, Mr Deputy Speaker, we could not let the 600th anniversary of Agincourt pass without commemoration. The battle of Agincourt is, of course, celebrated by Shakespeare as a victory secured by a “band of brothers” It is also when a strong leader defeated an ill-judged alliance between the champion of a united Europe and a renegade force of Scottish nationalists. So it is well worth the £1 million we will provide to celebrate it. National recovery Mr Deputy Speaker Our country does not rest on its past glories. Within just fifteen years we have the potential to overtake Germany and have the largest economy in Europe. Five years ago, that would have seemed hopelessly unrealistic; economic rescue was the limit of our horizons. Today, our goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous of any major economy in the world in the coming generation, with that prosperity widely shared across our country. London is the global capital of the world, and we want it to grow stronger still. Today we confirm: new investment in transport; regeneration from Brent Cross to Croydon; new powers for the Mayor over skills and planning; and new funding for the London Land Commission to help address the acute housing shortage in the capital. For we don’t pull the rest of the country up, by pulling London down. Instead we will build on London’s success by building the Northern Powerhouse. Working across party lines, and in partnership with the councils of the north, we are this week publishing a comprehensive Transport Strategy for the North. We are funding the Health North initiative from the great teaching hospitals and universities there. We are promoting industries from chemicals in the North East to Tech in the North West And I can today confirm agreement with the West Yorkshire Combined Authority for a new city deal. Our agreement with Greater Manchester on an elected mayor is the most exciting development in civic leadership for a generation – with the devolution of power over skills, transport and now health budgets. I can announce today that we have now reached provisional agreement to allow Greater Manchester to keep 100% of the additional growth in local business rates as we build up the Northern Powerhouse. For where cities grow their economies through local initiatives, let me be clear: we will support and reward them. We will also offer the same business rates deal to Cambridge and the surrounding councils, and my door is open to other areas too. For our ambition for a truly national recovery is not limited to building a Northern Powerhouse. We back in full the long term economic plans we have for every region. The Midlands is an engine of manufacturing growth. So we are today giving the go-ahead to a £60 million investment in the new Energy Research Accelerator and confirming the new national energy catapult will be in Birmingham. And we’re going to back our brilliant automotive industry by investing £100 million to stay ahead in the race to driverless technology. And to encourage a new generation of low emission vehicles we will increase their company car tax more slowly than previously planned, while increasing other rates by 3% in 2019-20. We’re also connecting up the South West, with over £7 billion of transport investment, better roads, support for air links, and – I can confirm today – a new rail franchise which will bring new intercity express trains and greatly improved rail services. We are confirming the introduction of the first 20 Housing Zones that will keep Britain building, along with the extension of 8 enterprise zones across Britain, with new zones in Plymouth and Blackpool too. We’re giving more power to Wales. We’re working on a Cardiff city deal and we are opening negotiations on the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon. The Severn Crossings are a vital link for Wales. I can tell the House we will reduce the toll rates from 2018, and abolish the higher band for small vans and buses. It’s a boost for the drivers of white vans. The legislation devolving corporation tax to Northern Ireland passed the House of Lords yesterday. We now urge all parties to commit to the Stormont House agreement, of which it was part. In Scotland, we will continue working on the historic devolution agreement, implement the Glasgow City Deal, and open negotiations on new city deals for Aberdeen and Inverness. While the falling oil price is good news for families across the country, it brings with it challenges for hundreds of thousands whose jobs depend on the North Sea. Thanks to the field allowances we’ve introduced we saw a record £15 billion of capital investment last year in the North Sea. But it’s clear to me that the fall in the oil price poses a pressing danger to the future of our North Sea industry – unless we take bold and immediate action. I take that action today. First, I am introducing from the start of next month a single, simple and generous tax allowance to stimulate investment at all stages of the industry. Second, the government will invest in new seismic surveys in under-explored areas of the UK Continental Shelf. Third, from next year, the Petroleum Revenue Tax will be cut from 50% to 35% to support continued production in older fields. Fourth, I am with immediate effect cutting the Supplementary Charge from 30% to 20%, and backdating it to the beginning of January. It amounts to £1.3 billion of support for the industry. And the OBR assesses that it will boost expected North Sea oil production by 15% by the end of the decade. Mr Deputy Speaker, it goes without saying that an independent Scotland would never have been able to afford such a package of support.

f1ad8b82,"Democrats have said they only intend to restore the tax rates that existed during the Clinton years. In reality they're proposing rates like those under President Carter. Media reports in recent weeks say that Senate Democrats are considering a 3% surtax on income over $1 million to raise federal revenues. This would come on top of the higher income tax rates that President Obama has already proposed through the cancellation of the Bush era tax-rate reductions. If the Democrats' millionaire surtax were to happen—and were added to other tax increases already enacted last year and other leading tax hike ideas on the table this year—this could leave the U.S. with a combined federal and state top tax rate on earnings of 62%. That's more than double the highest federal marginal rate of 28% when President Reagan left office in 1989. Welcome back to the 1970s. Here's the math behind that depressing calculation. Today's top federal income tax rate is 35%. Almost all Democrats in Washington want to repeal the Bush tax cuts on those who make more than $250,000 and phase out certain deductions, so the effective income tax rate would rise to about 41.5%. The 3% millionaire surtax raises that rate to 44.5%. Then last year, as part of the down payment for ObamaCare, Congress snuck in an extra 0.9% Medicare surtax on ""high-income earners,"" meaning any individual earning more than $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000. This brings the total tax rate to 47.9%.",Texans Breathe a Sigh of Relief,partially false

dfb72ca1,"A U.S. ambassador on Wednesday explicitly linked President Trump, Vice President Pence and other senior officials to what he came to believe was a campaign to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump’s political rival in exchange for a coveted White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid. The potentially historic, if hotly disputed, testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is the most damaging yet for Trump in Congress’s intensifying inquiry into whether the president should be impeached. More forcefully than he has before, Sondland declared that the Trump administration would not give Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a chance to visit the White House — unless Zelensky agreed to announce investigations that could help the president politically. “I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?” Sondland said. “. . . With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.” Sondland came to Capitol Hill as perhaps the most anticipated witness of the Democrats’ inquiry — a longtime Republican donor and Trump loyalist whose shifting accounts made it unclear which side of the political aisle his testimony might benefit more. He said after the hearing that he intended to stay in his post. But nearly from the moment his testimony began, it was clear he was ready to cast aspersions not just on the president, but also on the highest-ranking officials in his government. Sondland acknowledged that he and others were the ones pushing Ukrainians to announce investigations, but asserted they had merely “followed the president’s orders,” communicated through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Sondland testified that top-level officials — including Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — were made aware at various points of what was happening, and he provided emails to back up his assertions.","Wisconsin ACT scores plummet Newly released information from the Department of Instruction shows a dramatic decline in student ACT results in the past year. Test scores dropped Wisconsin from 2nd in the country to 41st in the nation among states where more than half the students took the exam. “The latest information released today is another glaring failure of the Walker Administration to make sound, smart policy decisions to improve education in our state,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning said on Thursday. “As a parent with children who have recently graduated from high school I’ve had a front row seat to the destructive changes that have short-changed our children and their futures. When budget cuts force schools to do more with less it’s no surprise that the quality of the education our children receive inevitably declines.” In last year’s State of the State address, Governor Scott Walker claimed his education policies were working, boasting that “ACT scores are up and Wisconsin now ranks second in the country.” Now, five days away from Walker’s next State of the State it’s clear that the policies of the last six years have failed schools, students, and parents. Out of a top score of 36, the average test score in the state dropped from 22.0 to 20.0, which pulls Wisconsin to dead last in the Midwest and tied with Kentucky for 41st in the entire country. Due to funding cuts, damage has been made to Wisconsin’s traditionally high-quality education system and now our kids, businesses and communities will suffer. Nationally, Wisconsin saw the fourth largest cut to K-12 general school aid funding in 2015-16 according to the nonpartisan research policy institute, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While Wisconsin has traditionally ranked above average in terms of ACT scores, these latest numbers place Wisconsin dead last in the Midwest and among the bottom ten states nationally. “I can only empathize with the parents across the state who see this news and grow ever more concerned with the direction of our state. Our kids deserve the same high-quality education we had as kids and the choices the legislature has made is stealing that from them..” said Laning. “The state of education in Wisconsin is not strong. The newest numbers should be a wake-up call to the governor and the Republican legislature that their misguided priorities are hurting our education system and, therefore, our kids, businesses and communities.”",TRUE
82ec7f13,"Then Romney put his boys on notice: He would be making predetermined stops for gas, and that was it. Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family's hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon's roof rack. He'd built a windshield for the carrier, to make the ride more comfortable for the dog. His father had known poverty as a child, Mitt only privilege. His father had succeeded without a college degree while Mitt was launched with the finest educational pedigree. Given all his advantages, Mitt seemed restless to make his mark sooner. If anything, 36-year-old Mitt, who had just been tapped to lead a new venture capital firm, was on track to achieve more at a younger age than his famously overachieving father. Even for someone who had always idolized his father, the similarities between his path in life and the one George Romney had cut before him were remarkable. Husband to his high school sweetheart , father to a brood of young children , bishop of his local Mormon church, and businessman on the threshold of life-altering success. As with most ventures in his life, he had left little to chance, mapping out the route and planning each stop. The destination for this journey in the summer of 1983 was his parents' cottage on the Canadian shores of Lake Huron. Romney would be returning to the place of his most cherished childhood memories. The white Chevy station wagon with the wood paneling was overstuffed with suitcases, supplies, and sons when Mitt Romney climbed behind the wheel to begin the annual 12-hour family trek from Boston to Ontario. Ann's roommate at BYU was Cindy Burton, a Michigan friend who would go on to marry Ann's older brother. Now Cindy Davies, she says that for a time she thought Ann might end up marrying Cameron. So it was in the fall of 1968, just months after he had survived a horrific car crash, that Romney received the letter he had been dreading. It wasn't the classic breakup letter, but it was close. Ann wrote that she hadn't had feelings for any of the BYU men pursuing her, until this one fellow named Kim Cameron, a basketball player and vice president of the student government. He reminded her, she wrote, of Mitt. Ann, meanwhile, was living the life of a co-ed at Brigham Young University. The Provo, Utah, campus was flush with men who had just returned from their own missions, with sharpened skills of persuasion and a determination to find a wife made more urgent by the Mormon ban on premarital sex. Not for nothing was the place nicknamed B-Y-Woo. But the 2 1/2-year mission took its toll on the romance. Under the rigid rules for missionaries, Romney was forbidden from telephoning Ann more than a couple of times a year, and his two visits with her were brief and supervised. Ann Davies had said yes to his informal marriage proposal when she was just 16. After Romney went to France, his father personally baptized her a Mormon. Staring at the wall, Romney worried, ''Is this what's in store for me?'' Back in 1967, when Romney was moving into a Paris apartment with fellow Mormon missionaries at 126 Rue du Chateau, his eyes were immediately drawn to a wall covered with hand-written letters. They were all ''Dear John'' break-up notes that other missionaries had received from their girlfriends back home. He had always treated Ann that way, especially since he'd nearly lost her. Tagg didn't get it back then, but now at age 37 he finally understands why his father has been willing to suspend his regimented ways when it comes to his wife. ''When they were dating,'' Tagg says, ''he felt like she was way better than him, and he was really lucky to have this catch. He really genuinely still feels that way, thinks, 'I'm so lucky I've got her.' So he puts her on a pedestal.'' ''Think about it,'' Tagg says, ''a 12-hour drive and the only time we stop is to get gas. When we stop, you can buy your food and go to the bathroom, but that's the only time we're stopping, so you'd better get it all done at once.'' Yet there was one exception to Mitt's nonstop policy. ''As soon as my mom says, 'I think I need to go to the bathroom,' he pulls over instantly, and doesn't complain. 'Anything for you, Ann.'.'' The church was at the center of the family's spiritual and social lives. Before high school every day, the boys went to a neighbor's house for ''seminary,'' where they would discuss scripture for 45 minutes. Sunday mornings were spent in church, and Sunday afternoons were devoted to volunteer work. Tuesday evening ''mutual'' brought together church families for basketball games and cookouts. While moving ahead briskly in the business world, Mitt took on the added responsibility of serving as a lay bishop of Belmont's Mormon congregation. ''Mitt,'' says Kem Gardner, a fellow church official from this period, ''just had the capacity to keep all the balls up in the air.'' Mitt and Ann moved east in 1971 so he could attend graduate school at Harvard. They settled in Belmont and began expanding their family. In 1981, Ann delivered their fifth and final son. By then, they had moved from a modest three-bedroom place to a handsome four-bedroom, natural shingle house near the private Belmont Hill School, which all five boys would attend. The next morning, the wedding party and guests flew to Salt Lake City and in the spired Mormon temple, Mitt and Ann were ''sealed'' for eternity. Because they were not Mormons, Ann's parents were not allowed inside. Mitt and Ann agreed to wait three months to walk down the aisle. The wedding was held in two parts. On March 21, 1969, exactly four years after their first conversation, Mitt, then 22, and Ann, 19, exchanged rings in a civil ceremony in her parents' home. It was officiated by church Elder Edwin Jones, the man after whom teenage Mitt had patterned his hairstyle. When they made it home, he told his parents about their plans for an immediate wedding. His father was delighted. His mother was horrified. A pillar of Detroit society, Lenore Romney knew a wedding was not something to be rushed. But that was only part of her hesitation. ''I think Lenore had a hard time letting go of her youngest son,'' Cindy Davies says, stressing Lenore's special connection to the baby her doctors had said she could never have. While George had quickly forged a loving bond with Ann, it took longer for Lenore. ''Her relationship with Ann wasn't as warm. She held back more.'' ''You want to get married?'' he asked. ''I feel exactly the same way,'' she said. ''Gosh, this feels like I've never been gone,'' he recalls telling her. ''I can't believe it.'' Ann joined the Romney clan in meeting him at the airport. Showered with hugs from his family, Mitt kept his focus squarely on Ann. Sitting with her in the third-row seat of his sister's Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, he wasted little time. As he flew home just before Christmas 1968, Romney worried about what awaited him and Ann. ''I didn't know how we would feel.'' Romney feared the same. In letters to Ann, he implored her to wait for him. ''I think that's probably right,'' Cameron says now. ''Emotionally, I felt very close to her.'' A few years later, Ann would be mocked for her public claim that she and Mitt had never had an argument, which sounded preposterous to the ears of many married mortals. But Tagg says it's not that his parents never disagree. ''I know there are things that she says that he doesn't agree with sometimes, and I see him kind of bite his tongue. But I know that they go and discuss it in private. He doesn't ever contradict my mother in public.'' After a few years, the tensions lifted, as Mitt learned to give Tagg more space, and Tagg began to regret how he'd been behaving. By the time he was 15, the arguments stopped, and Tagg was once again looking at his father and seeing his hero. Tagg's early-adolescent struggles were emotional in nature, which meant they played more to his mother's strengths than his father's. With a few exceptions, ''he's not emotional at all,'' Tagg says. ''She runs on emotion, he runs on logic.'' Tagg had no problem with his mother, ''but my dad and I would just go at it.'' Family members say Mitt had a tough time dealing with this rejection from his oldest son. After all, Mitt's relationship with his own father had never suffered such strain. ''Overnight,'' Tagg says, ''everything about him bugged me.'' The way he wore his jeans so short. The way he insisted all the boys wake up early on Saturdays for chores. Even the way he said good morning. ''It bothered me that he would be so nice about it.'' As Mitt had before him, Tagg spent his early years idolizing his father. But then he spent much of his adolescence wanting nothing to do with his dad. It began around age 11, when his father in his eyes went from ''superman to supernerd.'' In time, the five boys would take on their own profiles within the family. As Tagg would later describe his brothers, Matt was ''the jokester, always pushing people's buttons'' and Josh was ''the typical middle child, wanting lots of attention and getting a lot of it.'' Ben remained ''very reserved and quiet, a little aloof from the situation'' while Craig relished his role as ''the ultimate baby, everyone's favorite brother.'' Tagg says he himself was the typical oldest brother, ''Type A and too tightly wound.'' At night, the family had a tradition of holding a freewheeling discussion while sitting together in a room, with the lights turned off. The practice was an outgrowth of the boys' habit of wandering into their parents' room in the middle of the night, climbing onto the couch at the foot of their bed, and wanting to talk. Over time, the discussion drifted to the evening hours before bed, with the darkened room somehow allowing the boys to feel more free to open up. ''It was just a time to totally be yourself,'' Tagg says. Later that summer, Ann and Mitt, according to the story they both would tell, were lying in bed when she turned to him. With her father's advice about making the most of life still echoing in her head, she told Mitt, ''You've got to run against Ted Kennedy.'' He laughed and pulled the covers over his head. In June 1993, as her condition worsened, Ann's mother asked her sons, Rod and Jim Davies, to baptize her a Mormon, according to both sons. Five days after her baptism, she died. In late summer 1992, Ann's father's condition quickly deteriorated. He remained opposed to organized religion, even though all three of his children, thanks largely to their association with Mitt Romney, had built their lives around the Mormon Church. As he bid his life goodbye, he urged his only daughter to make the most of hers. Not long after settling into their new house, Ann and Mitt invited her parents to move in to their guest suite above a bank of garages. Ann's father was battling prostate cancer, her mother ovarian cancer, and Ann nursed them through their treatments at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1990, Romney began a turnaround effort at Bain & Company, the much larger -- but fast sinking -- sister company to Bain Capital. A few years later, he was back full time at his old firm. It had been reorganized as Bain Capital Inc., with Romney as CEO and sole owner. And it had matured, meaning far bigger paychecks were on their way. Before long, his father could have afforded to buy up the whole street, as he built a fortune that two of his former partners now estimate to be more than $400 million. Then, in 1989, Mitt and Ann allowed their first bout of conspicuous spending, plunking down $1.25 million for a stately five-bedroom house up the road, enlarging and renovating it, plus installing a pool and tennis court. At the time, Tagg was in France, following in his father's footsteps as a Mormon missionary. After his parents sent him a photo of their new place, he asked his father, ''How can you afford that house?'' His sons urged him to buy a luxury car, but he refused. Still, they had no idea how much money he had. Yet Mitt eschewed the trappings of wealth. The family had no cook or full-time maid. And Mitt continued to drive a dented Chevy Caprice Classic nicknamed ''the gray grunt.'' As the 1980s wore on, Mitt's responsibilities grew both at work and in the church, where he was promoted to stake president, overseeing about a dozen congregations. And his Midas touch at Bain Capital was helping to make him rich. In that way, the relationship between Mitt and Ann differed from the one between Mitt's parents. Despite their lifetime of devotion, George and Lenore had no problem airing their disagreements, especially in later years, according to Tagg. ''Listen, they fought like cats and dogs. We called them 'The Bickersons.'.'' It was the year Newt Gingrich was pushing his Contract with America, but Romney distanced himself from Gingrich and rejected help from the national right-wing apparatus. Romney stressed his own family values to create a contrast with Kennedy, who had a past reputation for womanizing. One commercial showed Mitt and Ann on their porch with glasses of lemonade. Asked to name his greatest personal failing, Romney lamented that he only had time to help the needy one day a week. He supported the assault weapons ban and the Brady gun control law. He favored indexing the minimum wage to inflation. In a letter to an organization of gay Republicans, he claimed he would be a stronger advocate for their rights than Kennedy. He demanded work for welfare recipients and talked tough on immigration, mandatory drug sentencing, and the death penalty. And, running in a state where the GOP's limited success had come mostly from fiscally conservative, socially liberal candidates, Romney staked out moderate positions on some issues. Despite Kennedy's baggage, Romney's team ruled out a character assault. Instead, Romney attacked Kennedy and his ''big-government'' policies as both being overdue for retirement. In October 1993, Romney changed his party affiliation from independent to Republican and began raising money. In February 1994, before a crowd of about 200 at the Copley Plaza, he formally announced his candidacy. Political operatives told Romney that Kennedy was never more vulnerable. ''People said to me, 'You know, he's getting older, he's over the hill. He's not coherent any more,'.'' Romney recalls. ''I was getting ready for this guy that was going to be kind of a doddering old fool. I'd be able to crush him like a grape.'' But Romney had timing on his side. An anti-Democratic storm was building nationwide. And the youngest Kennedy brother was a tarnished icon, even to Catholic voters raised in homes with brittle palm fronds wedged behind pictures of John F. Kennedy. The shocking revelations about the senior senator that emerged during the 1991 Palm Beach rape trial of his nephew remained fresh in many voters' minds. For a man who had succeeded in business largely by using rigorous analysis and fastidious preparation to reduce his margin of error, a run against Kennedy would be quite a roll of the dice. In 32 years, no Republican had come close to dislodging Kennedy, the embodiment of Democratic liberalism. Mitt had been contemplating a move into politics for some time. At age 55, his father had used his success as a business turnaround artist to launch his second act of politics. Now Mitt, who had already established his own turnaround credentials, was looking to follow the same script, except a decade ahead of his father's schedule. Romney held a news conference to criticize Kennedy for violating his own brother's edict to separate religion and politics, which in 1960 helped John Kennedy become the nation's first Catholic president. Kennedy's campaign said Romney should be asked about the Mormon Church's past policy of excluding blacks from the priesthood. But the Kennedy machinery, rusty at the start, was cranking up. So was the senator. Mitt's own race in 1994 got off to a good start. After he easily won the Republican primary , polls showed Romney to be even with or even slightly ahead of Kennedy. In the end, Hart handed out more than flowers, drubbing Lenore and giving her sons two important lessons about politics, according to Scott. ''You need to define yourself, and not let others define you. And it's no fun to lose.'' They resented how Hart tried to paint Lenore as a nice woman whose place was in the home, not the Senate. ''At the start of every debate, he would come over and hand her a rose,'' Scott recalls. Lenore Romney ran for US Senate in 1970 against popular Democratic incumbent Philip Hart. Taking a break from college to help out, 23-year-old Mitt turned to his older brother, Scott, and said, ''Gee, you and I ought to be running this campaign.'' Mitt had always been more careful and wary than his father, according to family members, and, in that way, more like his mother. In fact, his race against Kennedy had stronger parallels to his mother's single run for office than any of his father's campaigns. Despite the similarities between father and son in appearance and career path, the race highlighted the differences in their makeup. Behind the scenes, George - whose unguarded nature had hastened his downfall in the 1968 presidential campaign - admonished Mitt to loosen up, stop listening to consultants, and trust his gut. On the trail and on the fund-raising circuit, the vigorous 86-year-old was a celebrity stand-in for his son, relishing his return to the podium. Years later, Mitt Romney would recall watching the cameras shift away from him and onto his irrepressible father during press conferences, as George shook his fist and spoke his mind. Before long, George and Lenore moved into the guest suite above Mitt and Ann's garage, and George wasted no time in tutoring his son in politics. During the campaign kickoff, George Romney introduced his son, signaling the active role the former Michigan governor would play in the race and the reemergence of the father-son dynamic that had defined Mitt Romney's early life. He was more welcoming of help from his family. ''I don't want their money. I don't want their help,'' Romney said. ''This is my race.'' Still, Romney remained within striking distance, down 44 percent to Kennedy's 49 percent in a Globe poll in early October. Then came the first televised debate . Romney was on leave as Bain Capital's chief executive when the cuts occurred, but he struggled to rebut the charge. His polls numbers began to drop, with more voters describing him as a cold-hearted businessman. About a month before the election, Kennedy launched his most devastating attack. On the airwaves, he strafed Romney with tough ads designed to turn his greatest asset of business success into a vulnerability. Romney's Bain Capital had bought a paper company called American Pad & Paper, or Ampad , which then bought an Indiana plant and laid off workers, cut wages, and reduced benefits. The workers began striking. Seizing on Romney's candidacy, they brought their complaints to Massachusetts. Romney accepted the endorsement of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, though his aides labored to blur the distinctions with Kennedy, who years earlier had dropped his opposition to abortion and become a leader on abortion rights. Asked at the time how the two candidates differed on abortion, Romney's political consultant Charles Manning said, ''It's tiny nuances.'' Women's groups and political foes voiced skepticism over Romney's support of abortion rights. Although he said that as a politician he would not force his beliefs on others, Romney acknowledged that as a church leader, he had counseled women against having abortions. The Globe reported that as a Mormon bishop Romney had urged a mother of five, whose pelvic blood clot made her pregnancy dangerous, not to have an abortion. But there had been some wavering. Early in the campaign, he said he opposed Medicaid funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life. Later in the campaign, he said he would leave that matter up to the states. ''My mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter,'' Romney declared. ''And you will not see me wavering on that.'' Although he always said he was personally opposed to abortion, Romney sought to reassure Massachusetts voters of his pro-choice bona fides by citing his mother's example. Lenore had run for the Senate on an abortion-rights platform, a stance forged by the death of her son-in-law's teenage sister from an illegal abortion. The Kennedy camp also hammered Romney on abortion, asserting that he had a secret pro-life agenda. But it was George Romney who stole the show that day. Surprising even his son, he stepped forward and thundered, ''I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture.'' In 1997, Ann Romney felt numbness in her right leg. Then it spread to her entire right side. She had trouble getting up the stairs. Over the next year, she began having some difficulty swallowing, needing more sleep than usual, and feeling nauseated for a good part of every day. After the loss, Mitt told his brother, ''I never want to run for something again unless I can win.'' An unfailing optimist, George had never wallowed in his own failed campaign, and he didn't dwell on his son's either. Still, for Mitt, there was no denying that his idol's last image of him was one associated with failure. With Mitt back at Bain, his parents returned to Michigan. A year later, George Romney collapsed while running on his treadmill. He died at age 88. ''I'm sure I ruffled a lot of feathers,'' Romney recalled in his autobiography ''Turnaround.'' ''I had been gone for a year, and they were getting along fine without me. But Bain Capital was my baby and I was back in town. I owned 100 percent of the voting stock.'' After a year spent surrendering control to others - consultants, voters, even his father - Romney wasted no time in returning to his more comfortable position of being in charge. The morning after the election, he held a meeting at Bain Capital, and immediately started handing out assignments and reviewing deals. On election day, as Gingrich helped the GOP capture both houses of Congress for the first time in nearly half a century, Kennedy crushed Romney , 58 percent to 41 percent. By the end of the campaign, Romney began to heed his father's advice and loosen up. But it wasn't enough. Mitt Romney, like his mother a quarter-century earlier, had allowed his opponent to define him. When Romney charged that Kennedy had benefited from a no-bid real estate deal, the senior senator thundered back with the full weight of his family's history behind him. ''Mr. Romney, the Kennedys are not in public service to make money,'' he said, delivering a rehearsed line to wild applause. ''We have paid too high a price in our commitment to the public service of this country.'' Kennedy laid into Romney on Ampad . ''I don't know why you wouldn't meet with the strikers with that flimflam deal of yours out there in Indiana,'' he snorted. Expectations were low for Kennedy, seen as past his prime, and high for Romney, the telegenic upstart. But with his booming voice and fiery tone, Kennedy came out swinging. Although Romney had some effective parries and Kennedy occasionally tripped on his words, Romney appeared overmatched on stage with a legend. Fit and not yet 50, Ann knew something was seriously wrong. At first, Mitt held out hope that the numbness might be from a pinched nerve. In 1998, when Ann's primary care doctor referred her to a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Mitt went along. It was there, sitting in the neurologist's waiting room, when Mitt grasped the severity of what his wife was up against. One of the brochures he spotted was about Lou Gehrig's disease, another about multiple sclerosis. There was no brochure for pinched nerves. Mitt turned to his wife and, seeing the worry in her eyes, said, ''I can deal with anything, so long as it's not fatal.'' Once in the exam room, Dr. John Stakes led Ann through a series of neurological tests - pinpricks, standing on one leg, turning around with her eyes closed. It quickly became clear she was not doing well. ''When she'd stand, for instance, with her eyes closed,'' Mitt recalled recently, ''she'd fall over.'' After the doctor left the room, Mitt recalled, Ann ''broke down and cried, and I shed tears with her.'' The confirmation of the diagnosis as multiple sclerosis would come later, after an MRI. But it was this crushing experience of watching Ann fail test after test that Mitt would describe later as the worst day of his life. Until this moment, his had been mostly a charmed life. He had suffered defeat as a candidate, but that could be dismissed as the folly of taking on an icon. Mitt's siblings, meanwhile, had all suffered setbacks, including painful divorces endured by his brother and older sister. ''My life did not remain golden. I hit bottom,'' his sister Jane says. ''But it continued for Mitt.'' Yet, seeing the love of his life have to face a potentially crippling disease changed Mitt Romney. ''It subdued him,'' Jane says. The first two years after Ann's diagnosis were particularly trying, Mitt says. ''She'd get a little better and then she'd get worse.'' Meanwhile, his mother's health was also deteriorating, and in the summer of 1998, she suffered a stroke and died. Eventually, Ann found remarkable relief through a surprising mix of treatments - mainstream, alternative, and equestrian. To supplement her traditional care, Ann found a retired 80-year-old guru of reflexology by the name of Fritz Blietschau who agreed to take her on as a patient, helping her to build muscle strength. Ann also rekindled her childhood passion of horseback riding, finding that the exercise improved her mobility and spirits. She was beginning to see how MS didn't necessarily have to mean a future in a wheelchair. The lesson was coming not in Belmont, where she had made her home for nearly 30 years, but rather in Utah, where her reflexologist and equestrian companions were both based. By early 1999, Ann and Mitt were based there as well. That's because when the call came through offering Mitt Romney the opportunity of a lifetime, it also came with a Utah address.

843eabc3,"For those who seek to panic the public into handing control of all economic activity to the state, the prospect of rising sea levels inundating coastal cities has been the most useful tool. By propagating the theory that your SUV, air-conditioning, and jet travel will drown New York and Miami, and submerge Pacific islands out of existence, the warmists plan to extract trillions of dollars from advanced economies and distribute them to cronies making solar cells, electric cars, windmills, and other expensive substitutes, and to the rulers of third-world countries alleged to be devastated (with ""administrative costs"" sticking to the fingers of the bureaucrats, of course). It all makes intuitive sense, so children like Greta Thunberg are easily convinced that their futures have been stolen because you want to enjoy a first-world lifestyle. Melt the polar ice caps, and we are doomed! In real life, the problems with the theory have been understood by critical minds such as AT contributor and distinguished scientist S. Fred Singer (see below). Now a new study that found a proxy measure to trace sea levels back before the advent of industrialization has confirmed what Dr. Singer told us years ago: sea levels have been rising very gradually at a near constant rate since the end of the last ice age. The Global Warming Policy Forum (hat tip: Climate Depot) reports on the study: A study by the University of York found evidence for a period of enhanced pre-industrial sea-level rise of about 2-3 millimetres per year in three locations — Nova Scotia, Maine and Connecticut, which were largely natural, without any human constructions or man-made factors. These three locations are partly related to the North Atlantic Oscillation — a large-scale atmospheric pressure see-saw over the North Atlantic region – and to periods of enhanced ice melt in the Arctic, said the authors of the study, whose findings are published in Geophysical Research Letters. The authors of the study say cities like New York and Boston will have to take into cognizance this natural variability that may affect these cities in the future as well. The team found sea level reconstructions based on salt-marsh sediments from the Atlantic coast and from microscopic salt-marsh fossils. Salt-marshes are good ""archives"" of sea levels as they contain several metres of sediment which contains data going back hundreds of years. Faster than global average Previous studies have shown that, since the 1950s, rates of sea level rise along the Atlantic coast of North America were faster than the global average — leading to this region coming to be known as a sea level rise ""hotspot."" However, lead author Prof Roland Gehrels, from the University of York's Department of Environment and Geography, said this earlier rapid episode of sea level rise in the 18th Century wasn't known before. To find out what global warming is doing to sea levels today, the team examined the base level from historical times. ""In the 20th Century we see rates of up to three or four millimetres per year, faster than in any century in at least the last 3000 years. In the 18th Century they were slightly slower, but still much quicker than you would expect for the Little Ice Age, partly because the Arctic was relatively warm during the 18th Century,"" he noted. No human factors in pre-industrial era It was a pre-industrial phenomenon, so there were no anthropogenic forces — or human influences, he explained. In the 20th Century they might have played a key role but well before the industrialization, those rapid episodes of sea level rise on the north east coast of North America in the 18th Century might have been caused due to natural causes, he said. There is much more, and it is understandable to lay readers. Almost seven years ago, Dr. Singer wrote here about the complexities in understanding the actual sea level rise: The difficulty with projections of sea level rise is nicely illustrated by the IPCC. The estimates of its first assessment report (1990) showed a range of 10-367 cm for sea level in 2100. The second report, published in 1996, narrowed the range to 3–124 cm. Its third report, published in 2001, showed 11–77 cm. The fourth assessment report, published in 2007, showed 14–43 cm in its draft form but changed it to 18–59 cm in the final printed version. As can be seen, the maximum SLR decreased successively as estimates improved. All these IPCC projections are very much smaller than the extreme values of about 600 cm by activist-scientist James Hansen (and by climate multi-millionaire Al Gore) — which assume excessive and rapid melting of the Greenland icecap. This narrowing of estimates by the IPCC has caused great concern among alarmists who feared that the IPCC was being ""too conservative."" Probably as a result of this peer-pressure, estimates have now increased[.] There is much more of great interest in this lengthy article, as well as two others (here and here). The takeaways include the realization that sea level rise is gradual and has been going on for centuries, may or may not be related in some small way to CO2 emissions, and can be adapted to because it is so slow.","Kiev puts plans to hold Normandy Four summit at risk of failure, says source",FALSE
28ee11a1,"By The Journal Sentinel's Guy Boulton wrote this Jan. 1 in describing Obamacare's health insurance exchanges: ""The exchanges could help consumers and small businesses compare competing health plans"" and ""they also could increase price competition by requiring health insurers to offer more standardized plans and by providing consumers with better information about what they are buying."" Private-sector free-market insurance exchanges already exist without government intervention or taxpayer subsidies. If you Google ""health insurance quote,"" you will find a number of options. There are dozens of companies and hundreds of plan choices with a wide range of monthly costs depending on plan design. I used one of these to purchase insurance for my family, and millions of other people have used them as well. They work without government involvement. The real reason government-run exchanges are being created is to expand Medicaid and government-subsidized insurance. How will income or family size be verified on a website? This concept is ripe for fraud and abuse. And the subsidies are so generous that families of four making as much as $89,000 will be eligible for taxpayer subsidies. Our nation cannot afford this expensive program. Our country is overspending at a rapid and unsustainable rate of $1.3 trillion more than tax revenue annually. The federal debt is $15 trillion (and growing) and now is more than the annual Gross Domestic Product. When we are broke and overspending, it doesn't make sense to subsidize 75% of the people of Mississippi or more than half of those with private insurance in Wisconsin. Those pressing for a state or federal health insurance exchange in Wisconsin have misled people by telling them it will produce cost savings for both consumers and taxpayers. A government exchange will increase costs substantially both for consumers and taxpayers. Those saying otherwise may have their own interests at heart but certainly not those of Wisconsin and its citizens. A million-dollar study commissioned by the administration of former Gov. Jim Doyle told us that after Obamacare, nearly 90% of people with insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30%. Because of Obamacare, about 100,000 Wisconsinites will lose the private insurance they have now and will be forced to purchase new insurance. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court may overturn Obamacare, and the elections in November may result in repeal or reform of the law. Government exchanges don't have to be active until January 2014. There is plenty of time for the state to act after the Supreme Court and the voters have weighed in. Many other states are waiting for the outcome of the Supreme Court and elections. True free-market exchanges do exist, and the competition they generate yields positive results. A government-run Obamacare exchange is deceptive, ill-conceived and an expensive government expansion that our nation cannot afford at this time or in the near future. Remember, the vast majority of citizens have the best health care in the world. Truly poor people already have Medicaid (free taxpayer-paid health care), and older folks have Medicare. The provisions of Obamacare will only increase both insurance and taxpayer costs. Wisconsin should not participate in this costly federal program until the last possible moment. State Sen. Frank Lasee (R-De Pere) represents the 1st Senate District.","Redrawn Senate map passes House, scramble for seats begin",FALSE

Liberty Counsel — a law firm focused on religious freedom — caught wind of a Nebraska elementary school principal who banned a long list of Christmas-related items.

ff8dfd78,"This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which
states that, “[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney
General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special
Counsel] reached.”
The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and
systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016. In
June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that
Russian hackers had compromised its computer network. Releases of hacked materials—hacks
that public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government—began that same month.
Additional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in
October and November.
In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks’s first release of stolen documents, a foreign
government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy
advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign
government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that
it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July
31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign
were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.
That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government “directed
recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political
organizations,” and, “[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election
process.” After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia
for having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were
examining Russia’s interference in the election.
Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017
appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel
authorized him to investigate “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016
presidential election,” including any links or coordination between the Russian government and
individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.
As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel’s investigation established that
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a
Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence
service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers
working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also
identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although
the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit

electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not
establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
government in its election interference activities.
Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the
results of our investigation and the Special Counsel’s charging decisions, and we then provide an
overview of the two volumes of our report.
The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel’s Office found to be
supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out
the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other
instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with
confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events
occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there
was no evidence of those facts.
In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted
a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.” In so doing,
the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]” was used in communications with the Acting
Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation’s scope and that the term has
frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific
offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal
criminal law. For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability
was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the
factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign “coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears
in the appointment order—with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion,
“coordination” does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood
coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the
Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking
actions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests. We applied the term
coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the
Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.
The report on our investigation consists of two volumes:
Volume I describes the factual results of the Special Counsel’s investigation of Russia’s
interference in the 2016 presidential election and its interactions with the Trump Campaign.
Section I describes the scope of the investigation. Sections II and III describe the principal ways
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Section IV describes links between the Russian

government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Section V sets forth the Special
Counsel’s charging decisions.
Volume II addresses the President’s actions towards the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s
interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters, and his actions towards the
Special Counsel’s investigation. Volume II separately states its framework and the considerations
that guided that investigation.

RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN
The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference
operations identified by the investigation—a social media campaign designed to provoke and
amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg,
Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he
controlled. Prigozhin is widely reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin,

The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S.
political system through what it termed “information warfare.” The campaign evolved from a
generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a
targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton.
The IRA’s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the
names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United
States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and
made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The
investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the
IRA. Section II of this report details the Office’s investigation of the Russian social media
campaign.
RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS
At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in
early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions
(hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian
intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian
Army (GRU) carried out these operations.
In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign
volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU
hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
(DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands
of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC
announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government’s role in hacking its network, the GRU
began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas “DCLeaks” and
“Guccifer 2.0.” The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.
The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign” or “Campaign”)
showed interest in WikiLeaks’s releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage
candidate Clinton. Beginning in June 2016,

senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information damaging to candidate
Clinton. WikiLeaks’s first release came in July 2016. Around the same time, candidate Trump
announced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from a private server
used by Clinton when she was Secretary of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically).
WikiLeaks began releasing

Podesta’s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released
video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section III of this Report details the Office’s
investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign
supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.
RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN
The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of
contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.
The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring
or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and
worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from
information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that
members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its
election interference activities.
The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the
Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign
officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking
improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia
and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which
are summarized below in chronological order.
2015. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization
real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate Trump signed a Letter
of Intent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization
executive Michael Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian
government press secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through
at least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump.
Spring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact
with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to
Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told
Papadopoulos that the Russian government had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands
U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)
of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a
representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from
the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of
information damaging to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months
thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting
between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took place.
Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of
2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President. On
June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald
Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email
proposing the meeting had described as “official documents and information that would
incriminate Hillary.” The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as “part of Russia and its
government’s support for Mr. Trump.” The written communications setting up the meeting
showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist
candidate Trump’s electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer’s presentation did not provide such
information.
Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the DNC
announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC and obtained access to
opposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents.
In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity
to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had lived and worked
in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted
with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with
conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his
advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The Campaign then distanced itself
from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.
July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the
DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing
information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S.
intelligence agencies had “high confidence” that the Russian government was behind the theft of
emails and documents from the DNC. And within a week of the release, a foreign government
informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the
Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign
government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the
Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.
Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York
City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties
to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for
Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a “backdoor” way for
Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate
Trump’s assent to succeed (were he to be elected President). They also discussed the status of the
U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)
Trump Campaign and Manafort’s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states.
Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik,
and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.
Fall 2016. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in
graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy. Less
than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John Podesta’s emails that
had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. government institutions
were at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere
in the presidential election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement “that the Russian
Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions,
including from US political organizations.” Those “thefts” and the “disclosures” of the hacked
materials through online platforms such as WikiLeaks, the statement continued, “are intended to
interfere with the US election process.”
Post-2016 Election. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian government
officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The
Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to
arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there.
Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, was among
the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December, a
business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an
associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in
January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations. During the same period,
another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served
on the Campaign or the Transition Team. Dmitriev and Kushner’s friend collaborated on a short
written reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been
cleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and
Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having
interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian
Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the
sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in
response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted, “Great move
on delay (by V. Putin).” The next day, on December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him
the request had been received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result
of Flynn’s request.
On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect Trump
on a joint assessment—drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and
U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)
National Security Agency—that concluded with high confidence that Russia had intervened in the
election through a variety of means to assist Trump’s candidacy and harm Clinton’s. A
declassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day.
Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees—the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)—announced that they would
conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the
election. Then-FBI Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI’s
investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On March 20, 2017, in
open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey stated:
I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part
of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts
to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the
nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and
the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the
campaign and Russia’s efforts. . . . As with any counterintelligence investigation,
this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.
The investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until May 9,
2017, when President Trump fired Comey as FBI Director—an action which is analyzed in
Volume II of the report.
On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel
and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional
testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within
the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the
investigation.
President Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel’s appointment. He told advisors
that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions
unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in
efforts to curtail the Special Counsel’s investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it,
including through public and private contacts with potential witnesses. Those and related actions
are described and analyzed in Volume II of the report.
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL’S CHARGING DECISIONS
In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office
determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law
chargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual § 9-27.000 et seq.
(2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if
so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction;
U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)
and whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest that could not be adequately
served by prosecution elsewhere or through non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual § 9-
27.220.
Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office’s charging decisions,
which contain three main components.
First, the Office determined that Russia’s two principal interference operations in the 2016
U.S. presidential election—the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations—
violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media
campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by
undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign
influence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet
Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers who
carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts of
individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal laws,
the federal computer-intrusion statute, and they have been so charged. See United States v.
Netyksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215 (D.D.C.).
Harm to Ongoing Matter
Personal Privacy
Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to
the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was
not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to
charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian
principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks’s releases of hacked
materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence
was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with
representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.
Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump
Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated
individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian
election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal falsestatements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about
his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George
Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to
investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the
professor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of
thousands of emails. Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to
making false statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project.
Harm to Ongoing
Matter
 And in February 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that
U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)
Manafort lied to the Office and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications
with Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.
The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve
potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that interactions
between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate’s April
2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National
Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that
one Campaign official’s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing
assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The
investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September
2016 at Sessions’s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential
campaign.
The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete
picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked
their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office’s
judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other
witnesses and information—such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be
members of the media—in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice
Manual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was
presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or
“taint”) team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes
provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges
described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as
well—numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United
States.
Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct
we investigated—including some associated with the Trump Campaign—deleted relevant
communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature
encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In
such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to
contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared
inconsistent with other known facts.
Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office
believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps,
the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional
light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.

I. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL’S INVESTIGATION
On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein—then serving as Acting
Attorney General for the Russia investigation following the recusal of former Attorney General
Jeff Sessions on March 2, 2016—appointed the Special Counsel “to investigate Russian

Relying on “the authority vested” in the Acting Attorney General, “including 28 U.S.C. §§ 509,
510, and 515,” the Acting Attorney General ordered the appointment of a Special Counsel “in
order to discharge [the Acting Attorney General’s] responsibility to provide supervision and
management of the Department of Justice, and to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the
Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.” Appointment Order
(introduction). “The Special Counsel,” the Order stated, “is authorized to conduct the investigation
confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017,” including:
(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals
associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and
(ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and
(iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).
Appointment Order ¶ (b). Section 600.4 affords the Special Counsel “the authority to investigate
and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the
Special Counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence,
and intimidation of witnesses.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). The authority to investigate “any matters
that arose . . . directly from the investigation,” Appointment Order ¶ (b)(ii), covers similar crimes
that may have occurred during the course of the FBI’s confirmed investigation before the Special
Counsel’s appointment. ““If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate,” the
Order further provided, “the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from

They’ve even brought on board Lady Gaga, Jennifer Hudson, Amy Poehler, and other celebrities to help convince Millennials that the exchanges are cool. Apparently they think Millennials are gullible. But no veneer of popularity can mask the exchange system’s deep problems. The simple fact is that they are a bad deal for young people. And as a result, it makes more financial sense for Millennials to opt out of Obama-care rather than join its ranks. The most obvious problem with the exchange system is how it perversely relies on a system of generational redistribution. Quite simply, the law takes from the young to subsidize the old. That’s why the White House is so dead-set on getting young people to sign up — without our money, the system won’t work, and the exchanges will enter what has been called a “death spiral.” What’s missing in this political calculus is the realization that young people are the least able to afford to purchase healthcare. In an era of sky-high student loan debt (currently over $26,000 per borrower and rising), 16.1 percent unemployment, and stagnating and even falling salaries, Obama-care is estimated to increase insurance premiums for young people by an average of 169 percent. Coughing up that much cash isn’t just unaffordable; it’s financial suicide for a debt-ridden generation struggling to find good jobs. My generation’s concerns with Obamacare don’t end with the costs. Another sticking point is the law’s “Federal Data Services Hub.” This term is at best a euphemism; the Data Hub is an enormous database of every participant’s private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information that we probably wouldn’t want out in the open. It’s basically an National Security Agency-esque database of TMI — “too much information.” And there are way too many hands in this overflowing informational cookie jar. As it stands, local law enforcement, insurance companies, and innumerable federal agencies and low-level bureaucrats will have access to the Data Hub’s treasure trove of personal info. Even the law’s “navigators” — employees from non-governmental groups, some of which are politically controversial — will have access to the database’s secrets. It’s an astounding assault on privacy, and it’s no surprise that it’s being challenged in court. These problems, along with others, have even caused Congress to exempt itself from the exchange. Similarly, unions, corporations, and others with political connections have received waivers or extensions from the administration. Not everyone has been so lucky. Thankfully, Millennials do have one remaining option: Opt out of Obamacare. This path lets them pay a small penalty, which then frees them to purchase health insurance outside of the exchange system. That insurance can be specifically tailored to their individual needs — and it won’t have the drawbacks that make the exchange system so unappealing. Young people can actually end up saving a substantial amount of money by taking this road. A recent study by the National Center for Public Policy Research estimates that 3.7 million Americans between ages18 and 34 will save at least $500. A full 3 million will even save as much as $1,000. Opting out of Obamacare is thus an attractive option for Millennials, who tend to be healthy and need a greater share of their paychecks in order to make ends meet. Of course, the alternative is for them to join an exchange system that both picks their pockets and shares their secrets. No celebrity is popular enough to gloss over that.

Close","At least 13 Israelis have experienced facial paralysis after being administered the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, a month after the US Food and Drug Administration reported similar issues but said they weren’t linked to the jab. Israel has been hailed for its speedy and efficient mass inoculation program, which has vaccinated a staggering 20 percent of the country’s population since the drive began at the end of December. For a handful of Israelis, however, the initiative has led to some unexpected health scares. At least 13 people have reported mild facial paralysis after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Israeli outlet Ynet reported, citing the Health Ministry, adding that officials believe the number of such cases could be higher. “For at least 28 hours I walked around with it [facial paralysis],” one person who had the side effect told Ynet. “I can't say it was completely gone afterwards, but other than that I had no other pains, except a minor pain where the injection was, but there was nothing beyond that.”  The unnamed individual noted, though, that the unpleasant reaction was “something rare” and stressed that it was “important” people get vaccinated. However, he conceded that he was undecided about receiving a second dose of the vaccine. Israel’s Health Ministry has stated that it is safe to administer the second shot, provided the facial paralysis passes and there are no lingering, long-term effects from the first jab. But some Israeli medical experts have chosen to ignore this advisory. Ynet quoted Prof. Galia Rahav, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba Medical Center, who said she did not feel “comfortable” with administering the second dose to someone who had received the first jab and subsequently suffered from paralysis. “No one knows if this is connected to the vaccine or not. That's why I would refrain from giving a second dose to someone who suffered from paralysis after the first dose,” she told the outlet. Last month the FDA disclosed that Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, was reported by four participants during phase three trials of the Pfizer vaccine. All four cases involved individuals who had been given the actual jab. There were no reports of paralysis among the control group that received a placebo. In its report, the FDA noted the “numerical imbalance” of Bell’s palsy cases among the vaccine and placebo groups, but it said there were no other “non-serious adverse events” that showed a similar pattern. Ultimately, the US drug regulator concluded that the issue was “consistent with the expected background rate in the general population,” and added that there was no clear evidence linking the coronavirus vaccine to the unpleasant medical condition. Still, the agency recommended“surveillance for cases of Bell’s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.” Over the past several weeks, the Pfizer drug has received emergency approval from governments scrambling to vaccinate their citizens. In December, the UK became the first country in the world to begin administering the jab to the general population. Although health officials have described the vaccine as safe and effective at reducing Covid-19 symptoms, worrying reports continue to surface about serious adverse effects. Mexico launched a probe in early January after a young doctor was left paralyzed minutes after being administered the drug. There have also been numerous cases in which people who suffer from allergies have experienced severe reactions to the shot. Several reports have also linked the jab to unexplained deaths, but authorities have insisted that there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine is to blame in such cases. For example, a Portugese doctor who was reportedly in “perfect health”died shortly after being given the jab, but officials later concluded that there was no relationship between the death and the vaccine, adding that they could not disclose the exact cause of her death for legal reasons.",TRUE
8e197ce3,BILL GATES EXPLAINS THAT THE COVID VACCINE WILL LIKELY USE EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,"A quote from Politifact: Gates never said that the first licensed COVID-19 vaccine would use experimental technology or permanently alter DNA; he said specifically that “we don’t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like.” The most recent research also shows that RNA vaccines, which are being tested for COVID-19 right now, do degrade naturally and don’t alter DNA permanently. It does appear that there is some contention over the potential that DNA vaccines may permanently change a person’s DNA, as highlighted in this white paper from biotech company Moderna, a leading developer of RNA vaccine technology: “DNA vaccine work began thirty years ago, but as yet there are no licensed DNA vaccines and most remain in Phase 1 testing. (Figure 5) The key challenge associated with DNA vaccines is that they must penetrate the cell nucleus (crossing two membranes; the cytoplasm and the nucleus). The DNA must then be transcribed in the nucleus into mRNA before moving to the cytoplasm to stimulate antigen production. This core complex pathway often requires both larger doses and special, often painful delivery devices using electric shocks or gold microspheres into person’s skin to deliver the DNA vaccine. Once inside the nucleus, DNA vaccines have a risk of permanently changing a person’s DNA. ” [Source] Given the current state of world affairs, we felt that providing this correction and explanation was the best way to bring clarity and another perspective to this important issue. For any comments or questions, please contact editor@wakingtimes.com. —- “Currently, there are no RNA vaccines approved for human use.” ~Wikipedia Rather than instruct people on how to improve their overall health or boost their immunity with healthy foods, quality supplements, and physical activity, the powers-that-be are telling the world that the only way to survive the Coronavirus crisis is to rush the development of a vaccine and then inject every human being on the planet. The U.S. government along with major cities like Chicago are already moving forward with plans to use government resources and the military to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to Americans by the end of the year. At the forefront of this conversation is Bill Gates, who has emerged somehow as the world’s leading expert on pandemics and vaccines. Through his foundation he supports the WHO and the development of new vaccines, and is currently backing a number of pharmaceutical companies as they race to invent the product that will save the world from Covid-19. Typically, the process of developing, testing and mass producing vaccines takes years, but thanks to newly emerging, experimental technology, Gates hopes to be able to vaccine “7 billion healthy people” in record time. A new generation of vaccines is emerging as we speak. At present there are no DNA and RNA vaccines approved for human use, but as Gates says in the following post from his personal blog, the time for trying these out on everyone has come. In the following comment he explains the difference between traditional vaccines and DNA/RNA vaccines, which, again, have never been approved for human use: “Vaccines circumvent this whole process by teaching your body how to defeat a pathogen without ever getting sick. The two most common types—and the ones you’re probably most familiar with—are inactivated and live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed. Live vaccines, on the other hand, are made of living pathogens that have been weakened (or “attenuated”). They’re highly effective but more prone to side effects than their inactivated counterparts. Inactivated and live vaccines are what we consider “traditional” approaches. There are a number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates of both types, and for good reason: they’re well-established. We know how to test and manufacture them. The downside is that they’re time-consuming to make. There’s a ton of material in each dose of a vaccine. Most of that material is biological, which means you have to grow it. That takes time, unfortunately. That’s why I’m particularly excited by two new approaches that some of the candidates are taking: RNA and DNA vaccines. If one of these new approaches pans out, we’ll likely be able to get vaccines out to the whole world much faster. (For the sake of simplicity, I’m only going to explain RNA vaccines. DNA vaccines are similar, just with a different type of genetic material and method of administration.) Our foundation—both through our own funding and through CEPI—has been supporting the development of an RNA vaccine platform for nearly a decade. We were planning to use it to make vaccines for diseases that affect the poor like malaria, but now it’s looking like one of the most promising options for COVID. The first candidate to start human trials was an RNA vaccine created by a company called Moderna. Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit. Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit. Because RNA vaccines let your body do most of the work, they don’t require much material. That makes them much faster to manufacture. There’s a catch, though: we don’t know for sure yet if RNA is a viable platform for vaccines. Since COVID would be the first RNA vaccine out of the gate, we have to prove both that the platform itself works and that it creates immunity. It’s a bit like building your computer system and your first piece of software at the same time.” ~ Bill Gates So, the rushed Covid-19 vaccine will most likely not be a traditional vaccine. It will not be tested for the typical duration that most vaccines are tested for. It will very likely be distributed by the military, and it everyone on the planet will have to take it.",FALSE

Carswell responded: “That’s why we make the big bucks.” Set up under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the DOJ’s CRS, the employees of which are required by law to “conduct their activities in confidence,” reportedly has greatly expanded its role under President Barack Obama. Though the agency claims to use “impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures,” press reports along with the documents obtained by Judicial Watch suggest that the unit deployed to Sanford, FL, took an active role in working with those demanding the prosecution of Zimmerman. On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the Orlando Sentinel reported, “They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.” The paper quoted the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church, a focal point for protestors, as saying “They were there for us,” after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents. Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an audio recording of a “community meeting” held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford’s Police Chief Bill Lee, was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the “Dream Defenders” barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired. According to the Orlando Sentinel, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford. “These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “My guess is that most Americans would rightly object to taxpayers paying government employees to help organize racially-charged demonstrations.”",Court's joint enterprise ruling could free Ameen Jogee from jail,partially false

1632dc3f,"Posted: February 10, 2020 by Last updated: New online scams have preyed on the public's fear about coronavirus outbreak. Don't be fooled. Here is what we know about coronavirus and its related scams. UPDATE 03/05/2020: Yesterday, our malware intelligence researchers found a clever ploy to hide an info-stealer behind a website that purported to show updated coronavirus cases on a global map. Malwarebytes initially detected the malware, which carried the ominous and maybe-too-obvious filename “corona.exe”, as Trojan.Corona. Upon further analysis, we learned that this malware was actually a variant of AzorUlt, a family of spyware that steals information and sometimes downloads additional malware. We have now updated the detection name to Spyware.AzorUlt. Unlike similar coronavirus scams we discovered last month, this threat does not rely on an email campaign. Original story below. Panic and confusion about the recent coronavirus outbreak spurred threat actors to launch several malware campaigns across the world, relying on a tried-and-true method to infect people’s machines: fear. Cybercriminals targeted users in Japan with an Emotet campaign that included malicious Word documents that allegedly contained information about coronavirus prevention. Malware embedded into PDFs, MP4s, and Docx files circulated online, bearing titles that alluded to protection tips. Phishing emails that allegedly came from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were spotted, too. Malwarebytes also found a novel scam purporting to direct users to a donation page to help support government and medical research. All of these threats rely on the same dangerous intersection of misinformation and panic—a classic and grotesque cybercrime tactic. A great defense to these is, quite simply, the truth. At Malwarebytes, we understand that safeguarding you from cyberthreats goes beyond technological protection. It also means giving you the information you need to make smart, safe decisions. Because of this, we’re presenting verified resources and data about coronavirus that will hopefully steer users away from online threats. If you see a sketchy-looking email mentioning the virus (like the one we found below), don’t open it. Instead, come here. If you want to immediately see what these online scams look like, scroll below. What is coronavirus? According to the World Health Organization, the current coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the world is a single variant of a broader family of viruses, also called “coronavirus.” This particular strain of coronavirus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province. It has the title “2019-nCoV.” Though 2019-nCoV is from the same family of coronaviruses as SARS—which spread to 26 countries between 2002 and 2003—it is not the same virus. As of February 7, coronavirus has spread to at least 25 countries, including Australia, Vietnam, the United States, the Philippines, Nepal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, India, and more. Mexico has no reported cases—the only country in North America to avoid the virus, it appears. Countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, have not reported any confirmed cases of the virus, either. While the majority of infections are reported in China, with 31,211 confirmed cases, the highest count of any other country is Singapore, with 30 cases. Full, daily reports on the virus’ spread can be found at the World Health Organization’s resource page here: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports. The situation reports also provide information about every country with confirmed coronavirus cases, and this Al Jazeera article compiles that information up to February 6. According to a February 6 report in The Wall Street Journal that cites scientists and medical academics in China, the recent coronavirus likely started in bats. According to the US Center for Disease Control, coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. How can I protect myself from coronavirus? Because coronavirus spreads from human-to-human contact, the best protection methods involve good hygiene. According to the WHO, individuals should: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty. Maintain social distancing—maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever. Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. If you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Tell your health care provider if you have travelled in an area in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close contact with someone with who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms. If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel history to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand hygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible. The WHO also actively dispelled some current myths about coronavirus. For instance, individuals cannot catch the virus from dogs and cats that are their pets, and vaccines against pneumonia do not protect against coronavirus. For more information on coronavirus myths, please visit the WHO Myth Busters page here, along with the WHO Q&A page. What else should I know about coronavirus? Coronavirus is a serious threat, but it is not the world-ending plague that many fear. As of February 7, the virus has resulted in 637 total deaths. A February 6 notice by the Chinese media service CGTN reported more recoveries, at 1,542. Individuals should not fear receiving packages from China, the WHO said, as the virus cannot survive long durations on physical objects like packages and letters. Similarly, individuals should not dip into unmeasured fear of all things Chinese. These fears have turned New York’s Chinatown district into a “ghost town,” said one local business owner, and have fueled multiple xenophobic and racist assumptions across the world. The WHO says it is okay to receive packages delivered from China. Coronavirus has also received a strong global response. Air travel has been severely limited, Olympic qualifying games were relocated, workers built a hospital in about 10 days, fast food restaurants temporarily closed their locations, and China closed off entire populations—which has come with its own tragic tales of quarantine camps, isolation, and fear. The spread of the virus is scary, yes, but people are working day and night to prevent greater exposure. What should I know about coronavirus scams? Coronavirus online scams are largely similar to one another. By preying on misinformation and fear, cybercriminals hope to trick unwitting individuals into opening files and documents that promise information about the virus. However, Malwarebytes recently found an email scam that preys on people’s desire to help during a moment like this. The scam email—titled “URGENT: Coronavirus, Can we count on your support today?”—purportedly comes from the nondescript “Department of Health.” Inside, the email asks users to donate to coronavirus prevention causes. “We need your support , Would you consider donating 100 HKD to help us achieve our mission?” the email says near its end, before offering a disguised link that opens an application, not a website. The link itself begins with neither HTTPS or HTTP, but “HXXP.” A screenshot of an emailed coronavirus scam that preys on users’ good will. Routine scams that allegedly include information about prevention and protection also come through emails, like this phishing scam spotted by Sophos. A screenshot of the emailed coronavirus scam that Sophos discovered. The malicious email informs its recipient to open an attached document that includes information about “safety measures regarding the spreading of coronavirus,” which then directs users to a page that asks for their email address and password. These scams are becoming a dime a dozen, and we don’t expect them to dwindle any time soon. In fact, threat actors in China were spotted sending malware around through email and through the Chinese social media platform WeChat. Though the exact types of malware were not reported, the Computer Virus Emergency Response Center said the malware itself could be used to steal data or remotely control victims’ devices. Coronavirus information and data resources If you’re afraid about the spread of coronavirus, we understand.

6600699c,"Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, will today pledge to introduce an additional mandated health visit at 3-4 months, as part of Labour’s commitment to making Britain’s children the healthiest in the world. Experts say that 3-4 months is when mothers are at substantial risk of perinatal mental health problems, and is a critical time in supporting continued breastfeeding. Labour will commit an additional £25 million for health visiting to fund the pledge, paid for from Labour’s costed National Child Health Fund, announced in the General election. Child health outcomes in Britain are lagging behind most other high-income countries on obesity rates, tooth decay and mortality. Today’s pledge forms part of Labour’s all-out effort to tackle health inequalities and improve early intervention services. Jonathan Ashworth will also unveil new analysis showing that since the end of the national Health Visitor Programme in 2015, staffing numbers and funding have tailed off: Between 2016/17 and 2017/18, local authorities will have £55.2 million in real terms cut from their public health 0-5 children’s services, which primarily cover universal health visitor reviews, because of public health cuts imposed by this Tory Government. There were 8,244 full time equivalent health visitors working in the NHS as of December 2017, which is the lowest number since August 2013. Numbers peaked at 10,309 in October 2015, meaning there has been a fall of more than 2,065 health visitors or 20% in just over two years The impact of cuts to health visitor numbers is now leading to huge variations in outcomes for children across the country: Nationally, 12% of babies missed out on a New Birth Visit in the most recent period, but performance was mixed- rising to 17% in the South West of England. Nationally, 17% of babies missed out on their 6-8 week review- although in London this was a 1/3 rd of babies. of babies. Nationally, over 25% of children did not receive their mandated one year review by 12 months- in London this was a staggering 44% of children. 90% of North East babies received a two and a half year check, compared to just 64% in London and 73% in the East of England. Additionally, Jonathan Ashworth will today: Pledge to reinstate the Infant Feeding Survey- first established by a Labour Government and then abandoned by the Coalition Government. Pledge to work towards ensuring all maternity services achieve and maintain UNICEF’s UK Baby Friendly Initiative accreditation- as already occurs in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is recommended by NICE as a minimum standard. Pledge support for the ‘70/30 campaign’, which aims to bring about a 70% reduction in child maltreatment by the year 2030. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, speaking to the national ‘Breastfeeding: a public health priority’ conference in London, will say: “Sir Michael Marmot taught us: “The foundations for virtually every aspect of human development – physical, intellectual and emotional – are laid in early childhood.” “Yet after many years of progress, health outcomes for babies and young children in the UK are stalling. We are lagging behind most other high-income countries on mortality, breastfeeding and obesity rates. “So I want to use the opportunity of its 70th anniversary to reflect on the next stage of the NHS’s development. And I strongly believe a laser like focus on improving the health and wellbeing of every child must be an absolute priority. “The future of health visiting services is at a critical juncture. David Cameron and Theresa May used to boast of their commitment to increase the number of health visitors. Yet we have actually seen health visitors cut by more than 20 percent in just over two years. “We must do better in England where families generally receive the lowest level of universal health visiting support when compared to the other UK nations, both in numbers and quality of universal contacts received. “As Health Secretary it will be my commitment to work with Health Visitors to implement an additional mandated health visit at 3-4 months backed up by an extra £25 million of investment from our National Child Health Fund. “Children are 20 per cent of our population but 100 per cent of our future. So our ambition is to create the conditions for the healthiest children in the world.”",Up to a third of millennials 'face renting their entire life',TRUE

More important, President Trump had officially shut down the Cabal’s USA Inc. and re-started a restored Republic on 4 July 2020. It was all a part of the Alliance’s Plan to free the globe of the Communist Parties /Cabal’s suppression of The People. “The Plan To Save The World”: As part of that plan President Trump’s Space Force has been involved in worldwide blackouts in multiple countries as Alliance Special Force units made arrests. Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election. Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism. By Tues. 12 Jan. the White House had launched the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.

While discussing the deteriorating Security situation in parts of the country, on the floor of the Senate, the Minority Leader, Eyinnaya Abaribe, had called on the President to resign, if he could not guarantee security, nationwide. The National Assembly, some individuals and groups, have also called on the President to sack his Service Chiefs. However, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, told Reporters, in Abuja, on Thursday, that Buhari will not resign, because he has the mandate of Nigerians to preside over the affairs of the country, till 2023. He noted that the nation’s Security challenges is being aggravated by fake news. The Minister said: “As I said earlier, the country is facing Security challenges, and the challenges are being tackled headlong. “However, there have been some red herrings in recent times, including those calling for the resignation of Mr. President, or the sack of the Service Chiefs. “I just want to say that the government, which has provided and continues to provide the Military and the Security Agencies with the wherewithal, believes in their ability to tackle insecurity. “These challenges will be successfully tackled. I will however, advise all commentators, especially political and religious Leaders, to be very careful at this time, not to aggravate the situation with incendiary comments; comments that cash in on our religious, ethnic, and political fault lines, to further divide us. “The kind of comments that have been attributed to some Leaders, especially Religious Leaders, are incendiary and reckless. Leaders should be part of solutions to problems, rather than aggravating situations. “To those asking Mr. President to resign, I wish to say this: Mr. President will not resign. He has the overwhelming mandate of Nigerians to preside over the affairs of the country, till the expiration of his tenure in May 2023.”",Vice President Mike Pence: Our agenda is working for Philadelphia,TRUE

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice NHS hospital beds numbers have plunged by 20% over the past decade and left the health service at “breaking point”, the British Medical Association warned. Analysis by the BMA found the number of overnight beds in English hospitals fell by a fifth between 2006/7 and 2015/16. BMA chairman Mark Porter said: “The UK already has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head in Europe per head ,and these figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point. “High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.” The BMA’s new report found that in the first week of January this year, almost three-quarters of trusts had a bed occupancy rate of 95% on at least one day. According to the analysis, in 2000 there were an average of 3.8 beds per 1,000 people, but this had dropped to 2.4 beds by 2015. Image: Universal Images Group The report said that in November 2016, 14.8% of patients spent more than four hours waiting for a hospital bed, having been seen in an A&E department. “The data demonstrates the increasing pressures on the system,” Dr Porter said. “It provides evidence of the underlying cracks within the NHS, such as funding constraints, changes and increases in demand, disjointed care and workforce pressures,” the BMA report said. It noted that pressures on mental health services were particularly acute, with a 44% decrease in the number of mental health beds since 2000/01. The document was seized on by opposition politicians, with Labour saying it was a “wake-up call which Theresa May must not ignore” and the Liberal Democrats warning the situation was becoming “intolerable”. Image: Moment RF Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Thanks to Tory mishandling of our NHS, patient numbers in hospitals are now routinely above the levels recommended for safety. The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety. “The number of overnight hospital beds has decreased by over a fifth, and combined with Tory neglect and underfunding this has left nine out of 10 hospitals dangerously overcrowded this winter.” Lib Dem spokesman and former health minister Norman Lamb added: “Chronic bed shortages should be the exception not the rule. “The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. “The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.” A NHS Improvement spokeswoman said: “The NHS has been under real pressure this winter, as it copes with a surge in demand for emergency services the knock-on effects are felt throughout our hospitals. “Our hospitals are extremely busy but we are working tirelessly alongside providers to help them manage and to support more efficient use of the number of beds available.”",State wise to wait and see fate of health reform law,partially false

6378a0ff,"A coalition of civil society groups has described the proposed Control of Infectious Diseases Bill as a threat to human rights. The group, 41 in total, said the House of Representatives must subject the bill to public scrutiny by embarking on stakeholders’ consultations and a public hearing to harness public inputs into the legislation. Many Nigerians had criticised a move by the House of Representatives to repeal the Quarantine Act and replace it with the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill. The bill, which scaled second reading before it was stood down last week, has 82 sections. Sponsored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, the bill seeks to strengthen the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and make it more proactive and “not just reactive and function when there is an outbreak.” The bill seeks to empower the president, the minister of health as well as the director-general of NCDC, and the institutions they head, to make regulations on quarantining, vaccination and prevention of infectious diseases in Nigeria. CSOs position In a statement issued on Tuesday, the groups said the bill empowers NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms of the people. “The Bill empowers the NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms at will, and abuse constitutionally established institutions and processes, without any form of accountability. “For instance, Section 10 (3) gives the Director-General express powers to use force to enter any premises without a warrant,” it said. The group also said the bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. It, therefore, demanded the immediate review of all provisions of the bill. “The Bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. “This leaves room for significant amount of discretion on the part of the implementing authorities and limits the rights of citizens and respective institutions to question decisions taken in the exercise of the powers provided in the Bill. “We demand a review of all provisions of the Bill that foster inter-agency conflicts and abuse of power and undermine constitutionally guaranteed rights and are contrary to the rule of law and Nigeria’s international human rights obligations.” The groups include: Girl Child Africa, Center For Liberty, Centre for Democracy and Development, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Say No Campaign, Amnesty International, YIAGA Africa, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, Global Rights and African Centre for Media and Information Literacy.

Police Chief Robert Garner said that an anonymous tip was left on their drug hotline, expressing concern about a horrible burning smell that was coming from the back of the Decatur WalMart facility. When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room. “The thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,” said Chief Garner. “Apparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.” No one from Walmart’s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were “disappointed” that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down. 0 Comments comments",Georgia to Review Mail-in Ballot Signatures to Boost Confidence in Elections,FALSE

0c1b08cf,"Ten years ago, when I was studying to become a dietitian and public-health professional, the idea of stepping outside of our culture’s weight-centric dieting paradigm was almost unthinkable. Most of us have lived our entire lives in “diet culture” — a belief system that views being thin as a mark of health and moral virtue, promotes weight loss as a means of attaining higher status and better health, demonizes some foods while elevating others and oppresses people who don’t match culture’s image of health and beauty. It took years of study and professional and personal experience to arrive at the anti-diet paradigm I now embrace. So it’s not surprising that many r eaders of my Op-Ed, “I Help People Recover From Disordered Eating. Don’t Give Your Child This App.,” expressed doubts and concerns about taking this approach to food and body size. As a dietitian specializing in disordered eating, I wrote the Op-Ed to express the concerns that many of my colleagues and I share about how the new Weight Watchers (or WW, as it has been rebranded) app for kids could set millions of children on a path to a lifetime of pain. I hoped to help both kids and parents avoid the struggles I see every day in my work: fixation on weight and shape, internalized prejudice against people in larger bodies, harmful yo-yo weight cycling and compulsive exercise, not to mention compulsive tracking and logging of food and exercise. I don’t expect to completely change the thinking of readers with one article, or even several. But I would like to further the conversation by responding to some of the themes and questions that emerged from the more than 500 comments on the piece. I hope these exchanges can help people start to view issues involving food and weight in a new light that could significantly improve their well-being.",NY Assembly Democrats defend blocking bill to help Gold Star families,partially false
b099e01c,"The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges. The say a judge should take a killer's confession to the court into account when deciding whether they should be kept behind bars for good with a whole-life term. The proposal by the Sentencing Council, the body led by judges which instructs judges and magistrates on the punishments they should hand down, allows the possibility of eventual freedom to even the most evil murderers if they admit their guilt at the earliest opportunity. Critics warned yesterday that if the new sentencing rule goes into effect it could act as encouragement to murderers. Criminologist Dr David Green of the Civitas think tank, a former Home Office adviser on crime statistics, said: 'If someone knows they could get a lighter sentence if they own up, that could make them more inclined to kill.' The new murder sentencing rule is contained in a consultation document published by the Council, which lays down guidelines for judges and magistrates which they must follow unless they believe it would be unjust to do so. The paper suggests new guidance for the courts on what leniency should be shown to criminals who plead guilty. Murder sentences have been regarded as different from those imposed for all other crimes ever since the abolition of the death penalty in 1965. Those convicted of murder are always given a life sentence, but the judge also sets a real term of years that the killer will be made to serve in prison before release. The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West. The new proposal, which will now go through a three-month consultation process before the Council decides whether to put it into effect, says that 'a court should consider the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' The paper said this is one of 'some differences' from the existing murder sentencing rules, set down by the Council's predecessor body, the Sentencing Guidelines Council, in 2007. Different guidance on whole life terms for murderers, it said, is included to reflect a 2005 Court of Appeal decision on murder sentencing. Under the new proposal, the paper said, 'the draft guideline explicitly states that the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty may be taken into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' It added that 'murder is the most serious criminal offence and the sentence prescribed is different from all other sentences.' The 2005 Appeal Court judgement on murder sentencing and guilty pleas, handed down by then Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips and two other judges, considered sentences in two murder cases. The Appeal judges said: 'The court should consider the fact that the defendant has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' However this decision was not included in the sentencing rules for murder handed down to judges in 2007. A spokesman for the Sentencing Council said: 'The practice in the courts will be unchanged. Judges have to follow the decisions set down by the Court of Appeal.' The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield pictured, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West The Council also said that general criminals who do not plead guilty at the first opportunity should get a lesser cut in their sentence. The bonus for an early guilty plea should remain a third off the sentence, it said, but those who plead guilty later in the court process should get only a fifth off their sentence rather than a quarter. The Sentencing Council chairman, Appeal judge Lord Justice Treacy, said: 'We want those who have committed crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible. When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that they are spared having to appear at court to testify. 'It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other cases.' But Dr Green said: 'If a judge is considering a whole life sentence it must be a case of truly evil murder. The sole consideration should be how strong a message of disapproval society wants to send. It should be sending the strongest possible message.",Tapping private resources for public university good: Guest opinion,FALSE
b1a03e65,Vitamins C and D Finally Adopted as Coronavirus Treatmen,"Flu season is in full swing, and once again reports are coming in that formerly healthy people are suffering serious harm or even dying from taking the flu shot. The fact that the annual flu shot is deadly and dangerous is not a fact even in dispute. But these facts are seldom, if ever, communicated to the American public before marketing the flu shot to the entire population, including those most vulnerable such as young babies and sick seniors, as the flu shot is marketed in retail pharmacy stores across the nation as if they are just as safe as buying a candy bar or pack of gum. As you will see below, the Department of Justice report on compensated cases for vaccine injuries and deaths in the U.S. Vaccine Court, submitted each three months to the federal government Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, shows that millions of dollars are being spent for injuries and deaths due to the flu shot. As far as I know, Health Impact News is the only news source publishing this government data on compensated cases due to vaccine injuries and deaths. The December 6, 2018 meeting just concluded, and government attorney Catharine Reeves reported that there were 144 settlements for vaccine injuries and deaths the past 3 months, and 89 of those cases were listed in her report (see below). Some of these cases took more than 5 years to settle. Of those 89 cases compensated, 77 were for injuries and one death caused by the flu shot, making the flu shot the most dangerous vaccine in the United States, by far. The side effects of the flu shot include (among others): GBS – Guillain–Barré syndrome is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness (paralysis), beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body, with both sides being involved. TM – Transverse myelitis is an inflammation of both sides of one section of the spinal cord. This neurological disorder often damages the insulating material covering nerve cell fibers (myelin).Transverse myelitis interrupts the messages that the spinal cord nerves send throughout the body. ADEM – Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. CIDP – Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder — a condition that targets your body’s nerves. Symptoms aren’t the same for everyone, but you may be tired and have areas of numbness and pain. MS – Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. SIRVA – SIRVA stands for “Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration.” It can happen when a vaccine is injected into the shoulder too high or too deep and can cause several types of injuries. SIRVA can lead to intense, prolonged pain, limited range of motion, and shoulder-related injuries such as Adhesive Capsulitis or Frozen Shoulder Syndrome. Myasthenia gravis is a long-term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Peripheral Neuropathy  is damage to or disease affecting nerves, which may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function, or other aspects of health, depending on the type of nerve affected.

9c27fea0,"AdvertisementsOne day after the February 3 2020 Iowa caucuses — the first primary voting of all fifty American states — the hashtag #IowaCaucusDisaster remained at the top of Twitter’s “trending” charts after a confusing night with no clear, announced results. Even before caucus-goers gathered in Iowa to participate, the lead-up to the event was, to say the least, unusual. One of the first unexpected occurrences involved a decision to withhold the results of a highly anticipated final poll because of an apparent irregularity involving presidential contender Pete Buttigieg: The Des Moines Register poll, a closely watched indicator of the Iowa race, was canceled after at least one interviewer apparently omitted Pete Buttigieg’s name from the randomized list of candidates the surveyor read. The political website Axios reported that the reason for the error was that an interviewer increased the font size of the questionnaire on a computer screen, leaving the bottom choice invisible. A prescient article published by The Atlantic on February 3 2020, prior to the start of the caucuses, predicted possible chaos: BURLINGTON, Iowa—A crush of new Democratic voters, mobilized by a wave of anti-Trump energy, will arrive at their caucus precinct, and there will not be enough voter-registration forms. The lines will be long, and some Iowans, many of them elderly, will shiver in the cold for hours before getting inside. The caucus itself will be pandemonium: There won’t be enough preference cards for caucus-goers to write down their favorite presidential contenders. Voters will be incensed when they learn about the new realignment rules. There will be miscounts and recounts. And at the end of the night, once all the numbers have been crunched and recrunched, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders will each claim victory. This is Sandy Dockendorff’s nightmare scenario for tonight’s caucus. The 62-year-old former nurse, who is running a caucus in the small town of Danville, laid it all out for me over coffee [in late January 2020]. Her worst fears are unlikely to be realized. “The party has done everything it can to make sure that’s not the case,” she said. But the caucus is extremely complex, and rule changes threaten to make it even more bewildering for voters to navigate and complicated for the press to cover. The biggest fear: Democrats may not have a clear winner—a scenario that could further threaten Iowa’s imperiled first-in-the-nation position. Alas, it seemed Dockendorff’s fears were more than realized as the night wore on. As results failed to appear, social media lit up with debate over what exactly was taking place in Iowa, leading to, among other things, memes satirizing the lack of reported results: Just after 10PM Eastern time, the Iowa State Democratic Party stated it was doing “quality control” testing, thus delaying the results of the caucuses: In a void where results had been anticipated, speculation and rumors predictably rushed in to take their place. A number of claims were popular on Twitter, many of which in whole or in part attempted to explain the mitigating factors in the Iowa caucus meltdown. Rumor #1: Robby Mook, former campaign manager during Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid, designed an app used to limited efficacy during the Iowa caucuses. Mook’s name emerged Monday night as the purported architect of an app being blamed for many of the problems with Iowa caucus reporting; the app developer was provided as Shadow, and a related company identified as ACRONYM: Mook denied designing the app: On January 29 2020, the Des Moines Register reported Mook and another former campaign manager had consulted with the app’s developers, not that either had a hand in developing it: Both parties in Iowa and their app and web development vendors partnered [in fall 2018] with Harvard’s Defending Digital Democracy Project to develop strategies and systems to protect results and deal with any misinformation that’s reported on caucus night. They worked with campaign experts Robby Mook and Matt Rhodes — as well as experts in cybersecurity, national security, technology and election administration — and simulated the different ways that things could go wrong on caucus night. Mook, 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, and Rhodes, Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign manager, helped develop a public-service video to alert campaigns to the warning signs of hacking and misinformation. It was released in 2018, days after a federal indictment detailed how Russian intelligence operatives hacked Clinton’s presidential campaign, the DNC and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016. Mook’s name did not appear in a separate February 4 2020 Des Moines Register item about Clinton campaign operatives and the app in play in Iowa, and the organization also reported that Nevada would not be using the app in its own caucus: The smartphone application blamed in part for the ongoing delay in reporting results of the [February 3 2020] Iowa caucuses is linked with key Iowa and national Democrats associated with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. The revelation came as the Nevada Democratic Party announced [February 4 2020] it would not be using the same app in its Feb. 22 [2020] caucuses, despite earlier reports to the contrary. The app was issued by Jimmy Hickey of Shadow Inc., metadata of the program that the Des Moines Register analyzed Tuesday shows. Gerard Niemira and Krista Davis, who worked for Clinton’s 2016 campaign, co-founded Shadow. Rumor #2: Iowa caucus results were delayed due to onerous reporting requirements instituted by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on the request of Bernie Sanders supporters in 2016. Another rumor spreading held that supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in 2016 were largely at fault for the Iowa caucuses debacle in 2020: Tweets making that claim sometimes came with screenshots of a February 3 2020 Associated Press piece about changes to the caucus system: Q: Why are Democrats making this change? A: The new rules were mandated by the DNC as part of a package of changes sought by Bernie Sanders following his loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries. The changes were designed to make the caucus system more transparent and to make sure that even the lowest-performing candidates get credit for all the votes they receive. And it’s not just Iowa that is affected by the changes. The Nevada Democratic caucuses on Feb. 22 will also report three sets of results. Without context, it looked as if those two conditions — Iowa’s delayed caucus results and Sanders’ objections to 2016 caucusing — were directly related. But a December 2017 Des Moines Register report about the changes as they unfolded provided a bit more context before the 2020 primaries were underway. It began by reporting that absentee Iowans would be able to participate in 2020: Iowa’s first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential caucuses would break with decades of tradition in 2020 by allowing voters to cast absentee ballots and then releasing the raw total of votes won by each candidate. A Democratic National Committee panel known as the Unity Reform Commission set those changes into motion during a meeting here [in December 2017], clearing the way for perhaps the most significant changes to the Iowa caucuses since they emerged as a key step in the presidential nominating process five decades ago … DNC Chairman Tom Perez called the caucus reforms “game-changing.” “Obviously we want to make sure that if you’re a shift worker you can vote in a caucus,” Perez said. “We want to make sure a member of the military or someone else who’s been left out of the process — that you can vote, that you can make sure your franchise is exercised.” The piece quoted Sanders 2016 operative Jeff Weaver on complaints about the 2016 caucus: Commission member Jeff Weaver pointed to 2016 candidate Martin O’Malley, who campaigned heavily in Iowa and won a following but received 0.6 percent of the state delegate equivalents … The change forces Iowa, in effect, to release at least two different results: the traditional calculation of state delegate equivalents as well as a much more straightforward tally of votes. Finally, the reforms centered on the controversial influence of DNC “superdelegates,” party-appointed individuals unbound by primary results with outsized influence on the final tallies: In other business, the commission moved to scale back the influence of so-called “super-delegates” — the party leaders and insiders who were not bound to support a particular presidential candidate in previous national conventions. In a series of recommendations, the commission sharply reduced the number of super-delegates who can back a candidate regardless of how that candidate performed in their home state’s caucus or primary. The move is a response to 2016 convention delegates and particularly supporters of Bernie Sanders who believed Hillary Clinton’s nomination was unfairly bolstered by super-delegates who were unaccountable to the will of voters in their states. It is broadly true that supporters of Sanders (such as Weaver) as well as the DNC instituted reforms affecting the 2020 Iowa caucuses. But it was unclear whether those reforms — particularly ones involving superdelegates — had any direct effects on the Iowa caucus chaos. Rumor #3: “Quality control.” As mentioned above, Iowa’s official Democratic Party cited “quality control” as a cause for the delayed results, promising a 50 percent tally by 5PM on February 4 2020. It is true that the Democratic Party referenced “quality control,” but few details about what that meant exactly were available the morning after the Iowa caucuses: The party said it was doing “quality control” on the results before releasing them out of “an abundance of caution.” In a statement, the party said that 25% of precincts have reported results, but they have not publicly announced any numbers. The delay was linked, in part, to issues with a new app being used by the Iowa Democratic Party to report precinct results, though the party denied that the app crashed. The Iowa Democratic Party in a statement said, “We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results.” At 1:14 PM EST on February 4 2020, NPR reported: But as of Tuesday afternoon [February 4 2020], the state’s Democratic Party was still struggling to report the outcome of [the previous] night’s caucuses, blaming the delay on problems with that app. The party told campaign representatives it plans to release some results by 5 p.m. ET [on February 4 2020]. The party said it has determined “with certainty” that “the underlying data” via its new app “was sound.” In a statement Tuesday [February 4 2020], party chair Troy Price said the app was recording data accurately, but “it was reporting out only partial data” because of a “coding issue in the reporting system.” NPR’s reporting also pointed out that the app and its late introduction to caucus chairs might be in part to blame for the chaos and confusion: Multiple county chairs blamed the app for the delayed reporting of results. Holly Christine Brown said she was only appointed [in late January 2020] as the Asian/Pacific Islander caucus chair for the Iowa Democratic Party and first saw the app on [the evening of January 31 2020]. “We were just given access to the app and told, ‘Play around in there a little bit,’ and that was about as much training as we got,” Brown told NPR’s Rachel Martin. “We were able to call in and ask questions, but there was no real training on the app.” Brown said the problems with [February 3 2020] caucuses will “absolutely” increase calls to change Iowa’s system. “People are very upset about how this happened and how this played out,” she said. Elesha Gayman, the Scott County Democratic chair, said the app was difficult to use for older and younger people alike. “It was unique; it’s not something you can download in the app store,” she said. “You actually had to fill out a form.

We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.” Rumor #3: Unfair coin flips or coin tosses. A contentious element of the 2016 Iowa caucuses involved the purported use of coin flips to award delegates, a factor witnesses inevitably claimed was unfair. A number of Iowa coin flip rumors circulated on Twitter, but as was the case in 2016, their claims were impossible to either verify or debunk: Myriad rumors about the delay continued spreading on social media the day after the Iowa caucuses. Use of a new app called Shadow was blamed by many caucus chairs for the difficulties, and Iowa’s Democratic Party cited only an “abundance of caution” regarding “quality control” for the delays. Related rumors about coin flips or coin tosses used to award delegates also circulated widely on social media, but without firm results or numbers, it remained difficult to draw any conclusions about the array of speculative claims regarding chaos at Iowa’s caucuses in 2020.",Most people don't know climate change is entirely human-made,TRUE
0d657fd8,"Nicola Sturgeon must come clean on SNP plans to raise the age for the free bus pass, Scottish Labour said today. The Sunday Post reported that eligibility changes were in the works. This comes after draft budget documents showed a planned cut in the concessionary travel budget in 2017/18, and Transport Scotland avoided answering questions on the subject from the newspaper. A Scottish Labour-led administration introduced the free bus pass for over 60s. SNP Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has so far only stated that the SNP does not intend to scrap the bus pass – but the SNP has made no commitment on maintaining eligibility at 60. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted in response to growing concerns, saying only “The SNP is not taking anyone’s bus pass away”. But she has repeatedly refused to answer the key question of whether she plans to delay people becoming eligible for it in future. Scottish Labour’s Transport spokesperson Neil Bibby MSP said: “This is a carefully crafted form of words from Nicola Sturgeon which is deliberately designed to deceive. No wonder people are sick and tired of Nicola Sturgeon being disingenuous and dancing around words all the time. Why can’t Scotland’s First Minister just be straightforward with people on her intentions about the bus pass? The SNP Government has cut the bus pass budget by £10m and plan to cut back the eligibility criteria for the bus pass after the election. My response is a straightforward one – if the First Minister is not honest about her plans to cut back the bus pass now then the minority SNP Government will have absolutely no mandate to do so.”",Honduran father reveals daughter was never separated from her mother,partially false
dc22ab9d,"A single mother has told the BBC she fears losing her home, on the day the new benefits cap is introduced. Emma Bradley, who has four children, including a baby, said she could be left £76 a week short on her rent unless she finds work. The cap - which limits the income households receive in certain benefits - has been reduced from £26,000 a year to £20,000 a year outside London. The government says the cap is a clear incentive to move into a job. But the policy has been criticised by campaigners and unions. The GMB union described the lower cap as a monstrous new assault on 40,000 single mothers, which risks shattering the life chances of children up and down our country. Under the new system, Ms Bradley's benefits will be capped unless she works at least 16 hours a week. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on the day the new system was introduced, the mother-of-four from Coventry said she would quite happily work, but the childcare costs and the job of looking after her four children made it much harder to do so. She said she was having sleepless nights worrying about how she would find a job to fit around her family, saying: If I lose the house, which could happen, it is scary to think 'what would I do?'. 'Incentive' to find work The earliest free childcare provision is offered is when a child is aged two. The Gingerbread group, which campaigns for single parents, said 43,700 single parents with a child under the age of five would be hit by the cap. The new benefit cap is likely to drive more single parents into poverty. Many will have to choose between the roof over their children's heads and other essentials such as food and heating, said Gingerbread policy officer Laura Dewar. But ministers say the level of the cap is fair because it is close to the average salary after tax. The Department for Work and Pensions described it as a clear incentive to move into a job. The current Work and Pensions Secretary, Damian Green, said it was wrong that some claimants could receive more in benefits than the average wage. He said the government was making it as easy as possible for claimants to get work, by offering free childcare offers and structuring benefits to encourage people in to employment. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he denied that children of single parents who do not work were being condemned by the changes. I'm not saying that lone parents have to go and find a full-time job. If they want to avoid the benefit cap they only have to be working 16 hours a week and we will be providing free childcare to enable them to do that, he said. Two children holding an adult's handimage copyrightGetty Images image captionSome 320,000 children will be affected be the changes, analysis suggests The cap - which, in total, is now set to affect an estimated 88,000 households primarily with high rents or large families - relates to a string of benefits for those aged 16 to 64 including child tax credit, housing benefit, jobseeker's allowance and income support, but excludes some others such as disability living allowance. Households where someone works more than 16 hours a week are exempt. Under the new cap, those living in the UK outside of Greater London will receive a maximum of: £384.62 per week £20,000 a year for a couple £384.62 per week £20,000 a year for single people whose children live with them £257.69 per week £13,400 a year for single people who do not have children or whose children do not live with them The limits are higher for those living in Greater London boroughs. The new cap is: £442.31 per week £23,000 a year for a couple £442.31 per week £23,000 a year for single people whose children live with them £296.35 per week £15,410 a year for single people who do not have children or whose children do not live with them Those affected will most likely see their housing benefit amount being cut, but the changes are expected to take a few weeks to be fully implemented. Research by the Chartered Institute of Housing suggests 320,000 children will be affected estimating 115,000 households are impacted with families losing up to £100 a week. The cap will save the Treasury an estimated £100m a year in the long run, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies IFS - only a fraction of the total £12bn cuts to welfare spending over this parliament. But the IFS questioned whether the policy would actually have the desired effect. The lower cap would fail to move the majority of those affected into work or prompt them to downsize their home, it said. Speaking to the BBC shortly after resigning as work and pensions secretary in March, Iain Duncan Smith hit out at the arbitrary decision to lower the welfare cap. He questioned why working-age benefits were hit while pensioner benefits were protected. 'Route out of poverty' A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: We are committed to helping lone parents into a job which fits in around their caring responsibilities, which is why we are doubling the amount of free childcare available. We know that work is the best route out of poverty, and there are now record numbers of lone parents in work. The benefit cap provides a clear incentive to move into a job, even if it is part time, as anyone eligible for working tax credits is exempt. Even with the new cap, lone parents can still receive benefits up to the equivalent salary of £25,000, or £29,000 in London. Some discretionary funds are available for people struggling to pay their rent.","Historical Data destroys the Global Warming myth, and people are waking to it…",TRUE
ca53fa81,"SHARE By of the Sun Prairie - With the economy still struggling and his own political prospects in the balance, Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday he would seek a bipartisan approach on a second special session of jobs bills. Saying lawmakers should focus on jobs like a laser beam, Walker said he wanted to pass by November roughly 30 bills written by both Republicans and Democrats and targeting everything from biotech companies to farm and trucking businesses. But consumer advocates and Democrats immediately raised red flags on some of the legislation, noting that one bill would require families and small businesses to subsidize lower power rates for large manufacturers, other bills were still just drafts, and some - which would loosen regulations on everything from piers to wetlands - wouldn't necessarily create any jobs. For now, the special session doesn't include the two highest-profile pieces of economic development legislation - a bill to boost venture capital investments and another to rewrite the state's mining regulations and permitting process. ""We just want to make it easier for all the people who want to come and grow and expand in Wisconsin . . . to get away from all the other stuff, all the other subjects debated around the Capitol that distract us from this,"" Walker said, speaking at the firm Thermal Spray Technologies. In his speech, Walker struck a conciliatory tone, noting that many jobs bills in a January special session received bipartisan support. The call to refocus on jobs follows a spring dominated by a divisive debate over the Republican governor's repeal of most union bargaining for public workers and a summer overshadowed by recall elections against nine state senators for their stances on that legislation. So far the disagreements are lingering, with Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) taking the unusual step on Tuesday of refusing to appoint to a mining committee the senators recommended by Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona). This year, the economic picture in Wisconsin and the country has been mixed. The state created a net total of 30,100 jobs between December and August, after accounting for seasonal differences in hiring, but the unemployment rate has risen to 7.9% from 7.5%. Democrats welcomed the focus on jobs but questioned whether some of the bills, such as one that dealt with piers and others to limit lawsuits, would accomplish that goal. They asked whether the bills should be part of a special session that allows them to be potentially moved more quickly. ""We want to see bills rushed that will create jobs. We want to see bills slowed down that do not have any promise for creating jobs now,"" said Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), who has one of the bills on the list. Power rates The bill on utility discounts is being touted by Republican lawmakers as a tool to help Wisconsin's economy grow. The bill would expand a pilot program to offer a discount of nearly $5 million over five years to Mercury Marine, the final piece of a more than $120 million state-and-local financing package that helped the Fond du Lac engine maker decide not to move to Oklahoma. Charlie Higley, executive director of the ratepayers group Citizens' Utility Board, objected to a news release by Walker's office that referred to the bill as ""tax relief,"" saying that it dealt with utility rates and had nothing to do with taxes. Higley said that the proposed lower rates for certain large manufacturers would end up being paid for by what is essentially a hidden fee on other consumers. ""That's been prohibited for over 100 years because it's simply unfair to make ratepayers pay for discounts that go to other ratepayers,"" Higley said. A trade association of the state's largest power consumers backed the proposal. The bill ""would increase our competitiveness and help job creation efforts in Wisconsin. Many other regulated states across the country offer similar programs as part of their economic development tool kits,"" said Todd Stuart, executive director of the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. The announcement highlighting the bill Wednesday came one day before the state Public Service Commission, controlled by two Walker appointees, is scheduled to vote on whether to award the utility bill discounts to Mercury Marine. Discounts for the engine maker were announced as part of a package that included funding from the state, county and city to persuade Mercury not to move its manufacturing from Wisconsin to Stillwater, Okla. The company ended up receiving $122.7 million in state, county, federal stimulus and local funding, but Alliant's request for Mercury to receive a rate break was never authorized. It has been challenged by the Citizens' Utility Board but supported by Stuart's group. At a May public hearing on the utility rate bill, We Energies and the Municipal Electric Utilities of Wisconsin joined CUB in raising concerns about the impact the utility rate legislation would have on small businesses, which would be funding discounts for larger ones. But Wisconsin Power & Light and manufacturers backed the bill, saying it would help Wisconsin attract businesses by giving it a tool that other states, including Iowa and Minnesota, have. Rep. Mark Honadel (R-South Milwaukee) said Wednesday the bill is being revised to address concerns raised at the hearing. Another proposal highlighted by Walker Wednesday would create a program to make grants and loans to biotech companies. Those would be paid for by redirecting the growth in income taxes withheld by businesses in that sector for their workers. That draft legislation would be capped at $50 million a year and run for 15 years or $500 million over the life of the program. Wetlands bill Walker's list also included draft legislation to allow for construction on wetlands if new wetlands are created in other locations. Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison) said that he believes the draft bill would make it easier to allow so-called ""wetland mitigation"" - moving wetlands from one spot to another. He said he feared it was a backdoor effort to help mining company Gogebic Taconite of Hurley, which is proposing to construct a large iron ore mine in Ashland and Iron counties. But opponents of the current law say that the Department of Natural Resources has long inhibited commercial development by restricting what can be done on wetlands. Dan Johnson, an aide to Sen. Neal Kedzie (R-Elkhorn), a co-sponsor of the legislation, said the wetlands bill has nothing to do with mining. Another draft bill would make changes in how Wisconsin regulates the construction and size of piers on public waterways and grandfather in all existing docks on lakes and rivers. Pier regulation has also been controversial, with the DNR under the administration of former Gov. Jim Doyle saying that changes were needed to protect the sensitive shore area of water bodies and property owners saying they should be able to keep long-standing piers. Regulations approved in 2008 grandfathered most but not all piers, when the state set new standards on the size of new docks. This spring, the Legislature allowed pier owners one more year to meet the deadline to comply with the 2008 regulations. The new deadline is April 1, 2012. Democrats such as Barca questioned how that proposal could create any jobs at all. Walker spokesman Chris Schrimpf said that it was a measure to streamline regulation that ""has been worked on for a long time and made sense to be introduced as part of an overall package.""

The Syrian government has long accused the US of fueling groups of foreign Islamist fighters, even those bragging of committing atrocities in Syria, as long as they were willing to fight against the forces loyal to Damascus. Washington claimed its illegal deployment of troops in Syria was aimed at destroying IS, but even after the group was declared defeated the American boots remain on the ground. The latest public justification coming from the US is that oil in northeastern Syria needs to be “secured” from the defeated jihadists.

ADVERTISEMENT A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released Thursday evening shows Sanders leading with 44 percent to Clinton's 43 percent. Sanders's 1-point lead falls within the poll's margin of error. California's primary is open to independent voters that give Sanders a boost; among registered Democrats, Clinton still leads Sanders by 4 points, while Sanders has 50 percent support from independents to Clinton's 34 percent. But, the poll found, Clinton has a 10-point lead among those likely to vote next week, primarily due to support from older voters. Sanders has continued to close the gap between him and Clinton and has been campaigning hard across the state. “Bernie Sanders has tapped into a wellspring of support in the Democratic primary over the last several weeks and he’s closing with a rush,” said Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, which partnered with the L.A. Times to conduct the poll. ""If Clinton manages to hold him off and win the primary, it would be as a result of a low turnout that tilts the electorate in her direction."" Sanders has barnstormed California in recent weeks, hoping to grab a large share of the state's 475 pledged delegates up for grabs. However, if primary results are as close as recent polls indicate, Sanders and Clinton would split the 475 delegates evenly, which wouldn't give the Vermont senator much of a boost in his search for the nomination. Clinton leads Sanders in the pledged delegate count 1,769 to 1,501. When superdelegates, the unbound party leaders who vote at the July convention, are factored in, the former first lady's lead blossoms to 2,313 and puts her just 70 delegates short of the Democratic nomination, according to The Associated Press delegate tracker. Sanders has pledged to fight up until the Democratic National Convention to convince superdelegates to flip and hopes a convincing win in California will help. The Los Angeles Times poll is just the latest to show it will be a close race for the two Democratic candidates. A Field poll released Thursday morning showed Clinton leading Sanders by just 2 points, 45 percent to 43 percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. And a NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Wednesday similarly shows Clinton and Sanders within 2 points of each other: Clinton leads Sanders 49 percent to 47 percent in that poll. The LA Times poll surveyed 1,500 voters from May 19-31 and has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. That included 903 Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, and 503 likely Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 5 points.",Amazon near tipping point of switching from rainforest to savannah – study,FALSE

The United States has more than once demonstrated its contemptuous attitude to the system of international law and the wish to use the existing multilateral arms control mechanisms for advancing its own political agenda. Hypocritical position The Foreign Ministry recalled that the United States tries to incriminate Russia of an act of using chemical weapons in the so-called Skripal case.

32b6810a,"Poor British people in 2020 are unhealthier than those born into poverty 100 years ago, a study has found. Adults on low incomes who were born in 1920 enjoyed better health between the ages of 30 and 60, compared to those born in 1970. The study considered how many people are living with long-term illnesses which are considered 'life-limiting' – such as heart failure, as well as self-reported health. While a quarter of the least well-off men born in the early 20th Century were found to be in bad health, that figure has now risen to one in three. Meanwhile, the opposite has been true for the richest people, who now have poor health rates of around one in 10, showing the gap between rich and poor has widened. People born in the 1920s were less likely to say they had bad health when they hit their 30s, 40s and 50s than people born in the 1970s Pictured: Children in a train carriage in September 1922 The study showed that the probability of people describing their own health as bad has risen sharply for the poorest men dark grey line on the right-hand graph and gradually for the poorest women dark grey line on the left-hand graph since the 1920s University College London researchers said the gap will only get worse unless action is taken to address the widening inequality. The study analysed data for up to 263,390 people in the British General Household Survey from 1979 to 2011. The results used were people's own reports of how healthy they were, how they felt and also whether they had serious illnesses. People could be divided into the poorest third of the population, the wealthiest third and the middle class. The research did not give exact income breakdowns but government figures define households earning more than £900 per week as the wealthiest 30 per cent, and those earning less than £300 per week as the poorest 30 per cent. The study found women born in 1968-70 are twice as likely to have serious health problems than those born in 1920-22. The risk for men increased 1.5 times. A quarter of the poorest men in the 1920s 26 per cent had serious health problems, compared to more than a third in 1970 35 per cent. And among women, this rose from one in seven 15 per cent to one in five 19 per cent. For the richest households, however, the proportions of people reporting bad health shrank significantly during the same time, the study found. 'The results presented here show a widening in health inequalities by income,' wrote Dr Stephen Jivraj, who led the study. HOW CAN BEING ON A LOW INCOME DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH? People on low incomes are known to have significantly shorter lives than rich people, and also to spend less of their lives in good health. There are various ways being short of money can affect someone's health. Those who are constantly stressed about money and making ends meet produce more of the stress hormone, cortisol. Over time this is known to cause damaging swelling inside the body and also to add to weight gain, sleep problems, depression and insulin resistance, which may lead to diabetes. If people don't have enough money they are also more likely to work more than one job, work long hours, or do shift work, all of which can disrupt sleep patterns – not sleeping properly is linked to heart disease, weight gain and dementia. It is generally more expensive to get enough calories from healthy food, so poorer people often end up with worse diets which may leave them with vitamin deficiencies, excess fat, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes. And statistics show smoking rates are higher among people who are less well off. Smoking causes more than a dozen types of cancer, heart disease and increases the risk of dementia. Advertisement Dr Jivraj added: 'They point to a greater future demand in healthcare from people in society who will be least capable of managing their health as they enter ages when [ill health] becomes more common.' Dr Jivraj said it was beyond the scope of his study to say why the health of poorer people was getting worse. But he suggested it was because the differences between the rich and poor were getting larger. One of the reasons for this may be that, as house prices rise, the value of the homes of the wealthiest families increase, making them richer, while the poor are still left without property of their own and increasingly less likely to afford it. People in poverty are known to have worse health outcomes because being short on money causes constant stress. It is also more expensive to eat healthy foods and poor people are known to be more likely to smoke cigarettes. Worse self-reported health is known to be linked to a greater risk of developing serious illnesses and dying prematurely, Dr Jivraj said. In the survey, participants were asked to rate their general health – 'Over the last 12 months, would you say your health has on the whole been good, fairly good or not good?' And they also reported any 'limiting long-term illness' using a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer. Limiting illnesses were not named in the study but generally include conditions which significantly affect day-to-day life, such as heart failure, lung diseases, incurable cancer, dementia or conditions like Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. Bad health was less common among wealthier people and became rarer over time – one in six 16 per cent of the wealthiest men born in the 1920s said they had bad health, compared to one in 10 11 per cent in 1970. For women this changed from one in 13 eight per cent to one in 11 nine per cent.

3a5207e0,"ADVERTISEMENT Despite the closure of all tertiary institutions by the federal government, the Academic Staff of Universities Union (ASUU) has declared an indefinite strike after the expiration of its two-weeks warning strike. The national president of the union, Biodun Ogunyemi, announced the strike at a press conference in Abuja on Monday. “The union has decided to embark on total and indefinite strike from Monday 23,2020, ” he said. He said the union rejects the use of force to enrol on Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System (IPPIS). The National Universities Commission ordered universities across the country to close for a month, beginning from March 23, due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The union commenced its warning strike on March 9, 2020. Since the commencement of the strike, the government met with the union twice. ASUU is embarking on the strike over the non-payment of salaries of their members who failed to enrol into the federal government’s IPPIS, a payroll software mandated for all public officials. The government, last Thursday, also reached an interim agreement with striking university lecturers to integrate the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) into the IPPIS. The IPPIS is the government’s accountability software that has been made compulsory for all public institutions, mainly for personnel payroll. ASUU is opposed to the use of IPPIS for lecturers, saying it does not consider some of the peculiar operations of universities. The lecturers’ union then developed its own UTAS which it wants the government to adopt for universities. More details later…","Parents concerned about their vaccinated children potentially contracting measles from unvaccinated children may want to consider the fact that the bigger health threat is technically the vaccine, not the disease itself. Comparative data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveal that nobody has died from measles in more than 10 years, while at least 108 deaths reported in VAERS during the same time frame have been linked to measles vaccines. Many of our older readers probably remember a time when measles wasn't viewed with the obscene level of paranoid hysterics being witnessed today. Like chickenpox, measles was a common childhood infection that, after running its typically mild course, imparted lifelong immunity in those who contracted it. The risk of serious complications or death from measles has always been overwhelmingly minimal, in other words, with previous generations viewing it as something of a rite of passage. Fast forward to today and all rationality and common sense has gone out the window on this issue. The media is reporting a few isolated cases of measles as if it were the black plague, calling for those who don't vaccinate their children to be ostracized from their communities or even jailed for ""putting others at unnecessary risk."" But where are the facts in all this unsubstantiated mania, which unfairly tags the unvaccinated as dangerous lepers? Once again, the media is discarding factual reporting in favor of mindless sensationalism, attributing an alleged measles resurgence -- even this claim is specious -- to the unvaccinated. Whether or not this claim is actually true pales in importance compared to the fact that measles really isn't much of a threat in the first place. The measles vaccine, on the other hand, is a whole different story. ""There have been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003,"" the Associate Press reported based off statements made by Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Meanwhile, VAERS, which captures only a very small percentage of the actual number of injuries and deaths associated with measles vaccines, reports at least 108 deaths associated with measles vaccines since 2003. Of these, a shocking 96 deaths were reported in conjunction with MMR, which is now the preferred vaccine for measles immunization. Measles deaths were virtually nonexistent prior to introduction of vaccine, which is now triggering outbreaks Some will try to argue that measles deaths are essentially nonexistent now because of measles vaccines, the first of which was introduced in 1963. But this argument holds no water -- U.S. measles mortality data shows that deaths from measles rapidly declined in the years leading up to when the first vaccine was introduced, validating the success of improved sanitation and better nutrition in making measles a non-problem. ""What you may not have heard, is that by 1963, the death rate from measles in the United States had already dropped by approximately 98%,"" explains the International Medical Council on Vaccination (IMCV). Not long after it was introduced, the first measles vaccine was actually found to manifest worse symptoms of measles in vaccinated patients than if they hadn't gotten the vaccine at all. The vaccine also suppressed the normal rash and fever associated with measles, obstructing the normal immune response and ultimately leading to future health problems for vaccinated individuals once they reached adulthood. ""[W]hereas natural measles exposure generally left the person with reliable lifelong immunity, measles vaccines leave the individual with waning immunity,"" adds IMCV. ""This dynamic of waning immunity means we will probably see measles epidemics even in highly vaccinated populations.""",TRUE
2328d1b9,"The spike was led by an influx of migrant families, with more than 55,000 children among those taken into custody. A young child is seen as she along with other migrants are processed by Border Patrol agents after being detained when they crossed illegally into the United States from Mexico. The number of arrests at the border continued to surge in May. The flow of migrants at the southern border surged in May as authorities last month apprehended or deemed inadmissible for entry more than 144,000 migrants, according to numbers released Wednesday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The tally is a 32 percent jump from April and includes the highest number of apprehensions in a month on the southern border in 13 years. More than 55,000 migrant children were among those taken into custody while the number of families and unaccompanied migrant children encountered at the border skyrockets, officials told reporters. The volume of migrants has taxed immigration facilities beyond their breaking point. CBP is currently housing some 19,000 migrant detainees, more than three times beyond what authorities consider a crisis level, officials said. ""We are in a full-blown emergency. I cannot say this stronger: the system is broken,"" acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said.
Family unit apprehensions jumped dramatically last month, continuing a trend: Border Patrol apprehended some 84,500 migrants in family units in May, a 44% increase over the number of families caught at the border in April and more than triple the number of those apprehended in November. An additional 4,134 migrants together as families appeared at ports of entry, but were deemed inadmissible by authorities. The number of unaccompanied migrant children also rose in May, increasing to about 11,500 from 8,900 in April. Sanders noted that nearly 680,000 people have been encountered so far this year on the southern border – more than the population of Miami and on pace to break records for the number of migrants encountered in a year, he said.
Officials said most of the migrants arrests at the border are from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador – a group of Central American countries commonly known as the Northern Triangle. The volume of people arriving at the border has strained immigration facilities ""beyond the breaking point,"" said Randy Howe, CBP's executive director of operations in the office of field operations. A report from the Department of Homeland Security watchdog found ""dangerous overcrowding"" at a Border Patrol processing center in El Paso, Texas, in May, where cells were stuffed with 5 to 6 times the number of migrants than were their capacities. To handle the number of migrants, Customs and Border Patrol agents from all over the U.S. have been pulled from their posts to help at the southern border. Pooling resources at the southern border will impact operations elsewhere and increase wait times at ports of entry, especially as the summer travel season picks up, officials said. In addition to seeing the demographic of migrants encountered at the border shift dramatically from mostly single adults to primarily families and unaccompanied children, immigration authorities said they are also seeing a marked increase in the number of large groups apprehended along the border. Authorities have encountered 182 groups of 100 migrants or more this fiscal year, including 48 in May, officials said. Last year, Border Patrol encountered 13 such groups. Last week, a group of over 1,000 migrants surrendered to Border Patrol agents after crossing the border illegally. It was the largest group Border Patrol has ever seen, officials said. The influx of migrants has been a constant focus of President Donald Trump, who has previously declared a national emergency to build a border wall and purged the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security, vowing to get ""tougher"" on immigration. Last week, Trump announced that the U.S. will impose tariffs on Mexican goods in an attempt to compel Mexico to stymie the flow of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican and U.S. officials were meeting Wednesday for talks over the tariffs, which have been unpopular even among Republican lawmakers.",Bill Gates offered House of Reps $10m bribe for speedy passage of compulsory vaccine bill – CUPP alleges,partially false
7d021245,"The phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on Monday night along with encouragement to “clog the lines,” an indication that jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been due to prank calls. An Iowa Democratic Party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included “supporters of President Trump who called to express their displeasure with the Democratic Party.” The party official’s comments were first reported late Wednesday by Bloomberg News. Users on a politics-focused section of the fringe 4chan message board repeatedly posted the phone number for the Iowa Democratic Party, which was found by a simple Google search, both as screenshots and in plain text, alongside instructions. ""They have to call in the results now. Very long hold times being reported. Phone line being clogged,"" one user posted at about 11 p.m. ET on Monday, three hours after the caucuses began. ""Uh oh how unfortunate it would be for a bunch of mischief makers to start clogging the lines,"" responded another anonymous user, sarcastically. Some users chimed in, posting alleged wait times on hold, imploring others to “clog the lines [and] make the call lads.” Rob Sand, state auditor of Iowa, said he took results calls on Monday night as a volunteer and received an influx of calls that appeared to have been generated by a post on the internet. “A lot of calls came in at a certain point where it was clear somebody had published the hotline number somewhere,” Sand said. He cautioned that he could not speak for other people who were taking calls and said he did not get any calls that said they were from Trump supporters. He added that the system prevented people from reporting fake results. He also said he was able to identify fake calls quickly. “If I picked up the phone and it was clear after the first handful of words that someone was not calling to report the results, I just hung up,” Sand said. Mandy McClure, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, confirmed that the hotline received “an unusually high volume of inbound phone calls to its caucus hotline, including supporters of President Trump.” “The unexplained, and at times hostile, calls contributed to the delay in the Iowa Democratic Party’s collection of results, but in no way affected the integrity of information gathered or the accuracy of data sets reported,” McClure said in a statement. The telephone reporting problems added to other issues, notably a smartphone app that did not work for some people and that also had a coding problem that prevented results from being reported properly, pushing more caucus volunteers to the phone lines. Iowa Democratic Party officials said that party staff members and volunteers flagged and subsequently blocked repeat callers who appeared to be reaching out in an attempt to interfere with their reporting duties. These included callers who would hang up immediately after being connected and callers who expressed support for Trump and displeasure with the Democratic Party. It’s unclear how many prank calls the party received or how much they contributed to wait times. Some calls came from Iowans looking to confirm details of their evening’s caucus, party officials said. The party has not responded to requests for information on how many individuals were manning the phone lines on Monday night. The Trump campaign denied any affiliation with people clogging phone lines on Monday night. “We don’t know anything about this, but perhaps Democrats should consider using an app that works,"" communications director Tim Murtaugh said. ""It's laughable that they would try to blame Trump for their own incompetence."" Several officials at caucuses attended by NBC News reporters struggled with lengthy hold times that made it impossible for them to report results. 4chan, which hosts an anonymous and often extremist politics board called /pol/ whose users have largely supported Trump since 2015, is known for extensive online political trolling and targeted harassment campaigns. On debate nights, 4chan users often direct one another to swarm and manipulate specific online polls on other websites with repeat votes, a practice known as “brigading” in online communities. The polls would then be used by politicians and partisan websites to claim shocking upsets. Users on 4chan are anonymous, and usernames are randomly generated with each new thread. Some users on 4chan pushed back against users claiming to spam phone lines on Monday night. One user said he didn’t want other trolls “making us the scapegoat for the DNC.” “I can’t wait for the news headlines saying nefarious trolls ruined the caucus,” another added. Two precinct chairs said they were unaware of any interference with the hotline and doubted it made much of an impact. “I wouldn’t blame the Republicans,” said Tom Courtney, co-chair of the Des Moines County Democratic Party and a precinct chair. “I’d love to blame the Republicans and the Trumpers, but I don’t know.” Mike Carberry, chair for a precinct in Iowa City, also said he doubted prank calls were the primary reason for long wait times. “I’m sure that they got some calls, but those could be sorted through relatively quickly,” he said. Another hotline staffer who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the prank calls but that they were not the main reason that results were delayed. “It was definitely a problem,” the staffer said. “But it was definitely not the reason that results were a mess.”",Clog the lines': Internet trolls deliberately disrupted the Iowa caucuses hotline for reporting results,other

""Attorney General Bondi is right to focus on the need for states to protect and defend the individual liberties of their citizens, as well as preserve the constitutional principle of limited government.

Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months, added Hasner. ""Individual liberty and limited government are paramount toward the defeat of Obamacare, but we should also never forget the incredible toll this massive overreach of government will take on our economic freedoms, as well.

58ee2468,"In September 1959, Nikita Khrushchev became the first Soviet leader to visit America. It was a remarkable event and a seminal moment in the Cold War. Born in 1894 the son of poor peasants in Russia, Khrushchev’s life charts what is arguably the most dramatic period in Russian history, straddling the First World War, the 1917 February and October revolutions, the 1918–1922 civil war that ensued thereafter, the upheavals of the 1920s, followed by the five year plans and purges of the 1930s. It also takes in the Second World War and the post-Stalin period, a period in which Khrushchev was personally and politically central with his infamous 1956 ‘secret speech’ to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union CPSU in Moscow. Read more For a leader whose political career was closely bound up with Stalin’s, the speech was considered by some to be an act of treachery – a cynical attempt to salve his own conscience by distancing himself from the brutal excesses of his predecessor. Others considered the speech courageous and necessary, beginning the thawing out of a sclerotic political culture within the upper echelons of the Party and government that was incompatible with the times, thus allowing the country and its people to breathe more easily. Regardless of the whys and wherefores, what cannot be gainsaid is that Khrushchev’s peasant background and homespun style belied a leader who was willing to take risks at home and also on the international stage. He well understood the crucial distinction between doctrinal purity that looks good on paper and policies that pass the all important test of being applicable to real world conditions, ensuring that he could never be accused of being a prisoner of fixed ideological positions. The fruits of such a worldview were never more evident than in a foreign policy defined by the objective of peaceful coexistence with the West. And it is here we return to a fascinating episode in the history of the Cold War, when the Soviet premier, at President Eisenhower’s invitation, embarked on a two-week tour of the US on 15-27 September 1959. Khrushchev, in his multi-volume memoirs, left behind a treasure trove of personal reminiscences and recollections of the tour. With refreshing candour, he confesses that when the invitation to visit the US arrived it took Moscow by surprise. “We had no reason to expect such an invitation,” he writes. “Our relations had been extremely strained… America had been boycotting us completely… and now, suddenly, this invitation. What did it mean? A shift of some kind? It was hard to believe.” His sense of pride at the shift in Washington’s stance towards the Soviet Union, though, is unabashed: “We’d come a long way from the time when the United States wouldn’t even grant us diplomatic recognition. We felt pride in our country, our Party, our people, and the victories they had achieved. The main factors forcing the President [Eisenhower] to seek improved relations were our economic might, the might of our armed forces, and that of the whole socialist camp.” Read more A revealing insight into the culture within the Soviet leadership is provided by the wrangling that took place over who should be part of the delegation to the US: “The question came up of whether or not to take our wives. When Bulganin and I went to Geneva and London, we left our wives at home. Leaving them behind was one of our legacies from Stalin’s time. Stalin was very suspicious of anyone who took his wife on a trip with him… In general, we had always considered it unbusinesslike – and a petty-bourgeois luxury – to travel with our wives.” At the time of Eisenhower’s invitation, Khrushchev’s leadership was beset by crises at home and abroad. His previously mentioned speech to the 20th Congress of the CPSU, beginning the process of de-Stalinization, had the unintended consequence of catalysing anti-Soviet sentiment across the Eastern bloc, most explosively in Hungary. Meanwhile, the Cold War had got the point where it was more than justified to hold to the belief that World War III was a question of when, not if. In this context, a visit to the United States brought with it the opportunity to alleviate tensions between East and West that were pregnant with risk. Khrushchev’s abiding pride in the achievements of the Soviet system was manifest as soon as the Tu-114 aircraft bringing him to the US on a non-stop flight from the Soviet Union touched down in Washington and the Americans lacked stairs of sufficient height to reach the door. “They hadn’t known our plane was such a giant. We could see wonder in their eyes as they looked at it. They’d never seen anything like it, and they certainly didn’t have anything like it themselves, nor would they have one for a long time.” Apart from the series of talks the Soviet delegation held with their US counterparts on various subjects and matters of common interest, the tour took in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh, before culminating in private talks with Eisenhower at the President’s Camp David retreat. Khrushchev’s recollection of a dinner held in his honour during his visit to Los Angeles, bringing together the city’s most wealthy and influential dignitaries, is revelatory: “The meal was delicious and lavishly served,” he writes. “No sour cabbage soup for these people.” Read more But things took a decidedly negative turn when the city’s mayor addressed the dinner and in the course of his remarks insulted the Soviet Union. Khrushchev felt compelled to respond in kind in his own address to the assembled guests: “Mr Mayor, ‘I said,’ “I’m here as a guest of the President. I didn’t come to your city to be insulted or to listen to you denigrate our great country and our great people. If my presence is unwelcome, then my plane is always ready to take me straight back to the Soviet Union.” Khrushchev’s meeting with the head of the US auto workers’ union, Walter Reuther, provides another fascinating insight into the worldview of a man who’d been reared in the belief that communism heralded the future. “I studied Reuther closely… here was a man who had betrayed the class struggle… He made as much money [as head of the union] as the directors of the biggest American corporations, like Ford. In other words, the capitalists had bought him off.” Ultimately, the attempt to achieve a breakthrough in US-Soviet relations over the course of the tour failed. “I could tell Eisenhower was deflated,” Khrushchev writes. “He looked like a man who had fallen through a hole in the ice and been dragged from the river with freezing water still dripping off him.” But no matter, at least this son of Russian peasants was able to take comfort in the fact that getting ready to fly back to the Soviet Union with the rest of his delegation, the Americans “still hadn’t found a set of proper stairs high enough for our Tu-114.” Though the tour failed to produce the outcome sought by both leaders, it is testament to the political courage of President Eisenhower that he reached out and invited his Soviet counterpart to visit the country during a period of extreme hostility within Washington to Moscow. Indeed it is arguable that without his prolonged visit to the US in 1959, Khrushchev may not have been so willing to accommodate JFK during the Cuban Missile Crisis three years later in 1962 – the reason being that only in visiting the country or countries of his adversaries is a leader able to humanise it beyond the realm of geopolitical differences. In 2018, due to the unbounded anti-Russia fever that has Washington in its grip, it is highly unlikely that any such visit to the US by Russian President Vladimir Putin will be taking place anytime soon, nor to Russia by his US counterpart, President Trump. In this respect at least, the hard lessons of the twentieth century have been lost. Think your friends would be interested?

905519d3,"Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than £1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than £422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs £1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over £10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications. Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan Presentational grey line The rise in diabetes There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese 66.8% and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese 57.8% in England. Source: NHS England Presentational grey line Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly £477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around £350 million was spent on insulin, and £181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes.","Renationalising railways supported by almost two thirds of Britons, exclusive poll reveals",other

According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.” Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.

BEIJING, Feb. 15 Xinhua -- About a century ago, Walter Lippmann, known by many as the Father of Modern Journalism, criticized The New York Times for distorting reports on Russia and seeing not what was, but what men wished to see. While the Times' tradition to push a narrative instead of presenting the facts has long predated its highly biased reporting on China's fight against COVID-19, its latest step to twist facts to suit its anti-China agenda represents a new low for the daily. By intentionally misquoting professionals on a World Health Organization WHO team who have concluded their mission on COVID-19 origin-tracing in China, the Times, among some other Western media, have made themselves accomplices in politicizing the pandemic. Though the Times was at the vanguard when it came to pointing out conspiracy theories and lies churned out by the former U.S. administration of Donald Trump, it has more than its fair share distorted reality when it comes to reporting on China. Take its latest misleading account of the trip to China by the WHO expert team as an example. By selectively misquoting WHO experts to leave the impression that those scientists were endorsing the falseness of a report, the Times again attempted to frame China as lacking transparency. In the report, those WHO scientists were depicted as typically mild-mannered. Shortly after the report was published, two of those mild-mannered interviewees slammed the Times for misquoting them and stressed that the fabricated accounts by the Times was NOT my experience. Shame on you @nytimes! As Peter Daszak, a British zoologist and a member of the WHO expert team, tweeted. For the past months, the world has borne witness to how a politicization of the pandemic could hinder the global campaign against the once-in-a-century health crisis. Unfortunately, even now, some Western politicians and media like the Times are still spreading misinformation in pursuit of their geopolitical agenda against China. Photo taken on Feb. 9, 2021 shows a scene of the WHO-China joint study press conference in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province. Xinhua/Cheng Min While China is committed to transparency and global collaboration in the fight against COVID-19, some Western media like the Times have no qualms about abusing their influence to mislead the public over China out of self-interest. Those groundless accusations constitute a stark disrespect for the hard efforts of scientists from both China and the WHO, as well as malicious slander against China's achievements in the fight against COVID-19. As noted by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, COVID-19 origin-tracing is a complex scientific issue involving many countries and regions, and should be carried out by global scientists in collaboration. For the global collaboration to succeed, mutual respect and trust must be guaranteed. China is unswervingly committed to building trust, but some Western politicians and media like the Times should keep in mind that trust is a two-way street. ■","In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization to two messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against COVID-19. Because the unapproved vaccines’ status is investigational, anyone who gets an injection (whether they realize it or not) is agreeing to participate in an ongoing experiment. Recognizing that there are many unknowns, many Americans have refused the experimental jab, including members of the armed forces and healthcare workers, but with one notable exception: healthcare providers who are pregnant. Even without data from Pfizer or Moderna sufficient “to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy,” expectant doctors, nurses and others appear eager for the shots, perhaps influenced by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which states that neither a conversation with a clinician nor even a pregnancy test are necessary prerequisites. Do these individuals know that as of Feb. 12, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had already received 111 reports of adverse events experienced by women who were pregnant at the time of their Pfizer or Moderna injection? The first such report was submitted Dec. 22, just 10 days after authorization of the Pfizer vaccine. Nearly a third (31%) of the women had miscarriages or preterm births, which occurred within as little as one day of injection — the majority after a single dose of vaccine. Red flags The descriptions of miscarriages and premature births accompanying the VAERS reports are tragic and hair-raising. For example, a 37-year-old who received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine at 28 weeks of pregnancy, just after an ultrasound showed a healthy placenta, was discovered to have “significant placenta issues just one week later.” A repeat ultrasound showed that the placenta had “calcified and aged prematurely,” leading to recommended hospitalization for the duration of her pregnancy. A 35-year-old, also vaccinated at around 29 weeks of pregnancy, “noticed decreased motion of the baby” two days after receiving the Pfizer injection. The following day, “the baby was found to not have a heartbeat.” Two Pfizer vaccine recipients in earlier stages of pregnancy (first trimester) had miscarriages after experiencing “intolerable” abdominal pain and uterine bleeding extensive enough, in one case, to require “emergency surgery and a blood transfusion.” At least some of the individuals submitting these reports — taking stock of the tight temporal relationship between vaccination and adverse event — clearly judged it premature to rule out vaccine causality, especially in cases where the women were otherwise healthy and taking no other drugs or vaccines. Nonetheless, in unsupported statements parroted without question by the media, Dr. Anthony Fauci claimed on Jan. 21 and again on Feb. 3 that “no red flags” had surfaced for vaccinated pregnant women. Bizarrely, Fauci’s January comments indicated that 20,000 pregnant women had received COVID vaccines, while in subsequent remarks, he halved his apparently off-the-cuff estimate to 10,000. Fauci’s willingness to make light of potential COVID vaccine risks for pregnant women, only two months into the rollout of experimental vaccines, defies logic. Fauci is not only the Biden administration’s chief medical advisor but the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which holds patents and will receive royalties for the Moderna vaccine). Fauci surely knows that without substantive data — including birth registry data, medical records and complete information about all trimesters of pregnancy and birth outcomes for all of the vaccinated women and as-yet unborn babies receiving the unapproved vaccines — it is impossible to claim that risks are either known, or that they even have been evaluated. Moderna’s fact sheet states that the company is enrolling vaccinated women into a “pregnancy exposure registry.” The University of Washington is doing the same for COVID vaccine recipients who are either “pregnant, postpartum, lactating and/or contemplating pregnancy.” However, neither entity is anywhere close to being able to issue pronouncements about their findings. Interestingly, the World Health Organization on Jan. 27 issued guidance advising against pregnant women getting Moderna’s COVID vaccine — only to reverse that guidance two days later, as The New York Times reported. Hands off no more? Historically, pregnant women have been cautious about getting vaccinated or participating in vaccine clinical trials. In turn, vaccine developers have excluded them from trials, acknowledging the difficulty of tallying risks versus benefits. Documented risks of vaccination during pregnancy include miscarriage as well as neurodevelopmental problems arising from maternal immune activation (an inflammatory response in the mother that can harm fetal brain development). However, as psychiatrist Peter Breggin has written (describing the seven-decade-old branch of public health science focused on fear appeals), behavioral scientists know that “fear is a powerful motivator and can drive humans to be more easily manipulated into doing things they would ordinarily resist doing.” Understood in this context, it is easy to see how two decades of badgering from the pharmaceutical-industry-funded and Gates-funded media about exotic health threats — including H1N1 influenza in 2009, Zika in 2015-16 and now COVID-19 — might wear down the protective instincts of mothers-to-be, and especially those of younger women with less life experience. In addition to capitalizing on the media attention created by sporadic epidemics, public health officials and vaccine manufacturers have also successfully used outbreaks of illnesses like influenza and pertussis as wedges to spur a “paradigm shift in vaccine research and development as well as … policy regarding immunization in pregnancy,” according to “Who’s the Target? Mother or Baby”? In the mid-2000s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stirred up concern about flu and pertussis and aggressively stepped up its recommendations for routine vaccination of pregnant women. As a result, roughly three out of five American women now receive either influenza or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis) shots during pregnancy, while two out of five receive both. Studies of influenza vaccination during pregnancy link the shots, some of which contain thimerosal, to vastly increased risks of miscarriage as well as autism. And Tdap vaccines contain neurotoxic aluminum. While the developmental consequences of such widespread fetal exposure to aluminum can be suspected, they are difficult to pinpoint. That’s partly because most Tdap “safety” studies are short-term (and focus on pertussis disease rather than developmental outcomes) and also because babies immediately encounter an “absurdly high” load of aluminum in their early childhood vaccines. However, placental tissues and miscarried fetuses display high concentrations of aluminum, and high blood aluminum in the mother is associated with a risk of birth defects. The package insert for one of the leading brands of Tdap describes outcomes ranging from miscarriage to stillbirth, and major birth defects in women exposed to the vaccine before the third trimester. Wider concerns In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established a Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women. With the task force in place, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) now appears willing to ignore the ethical principles that historically have required researchers to put special research safeguards in place for pregnant women. Instead, virtuously advocating for “greater inclusion” of pregnant women in COVID vaccine clinical trials, the NIH is making the convoluted case that it is better to “protect” pregnant women “through research rather than from research.” No sooner said than done: Pfizer and partner BioNTech just announced (on Feb. 19) the launch of a trial that will formally test their COVID vaccine in 4,000 pregnant women. There are multiple reasons why pregnant women might question the push for “inclusion” — not least are the concerns about possible infertility outlined in a petition filed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Dec. 1. According to the petition’s authors — Dr. Michael Yeadon (one-time head of respiratory research at Pfizer) and Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg (former head of the German public health department) — there is plausible evidence to suggest that the spike proteins in the mRNA vaccines could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, a protein “responsible for the development of a placenta in mammals and humans” that is “an essential prerequisite for a successful pregnancy.” When a COVID vaccine recipient’s placenta has been verified through ultrasound as healthy and normal at the time of vaccination, but within a week shows up as “calcified” and prematurely aged, shouldn’t that raise a “red flag”? The push to vaccinate all pregnant women also highlights another subtle and even more disturbing issue, one that is a central focus of a lawsuit filed in federal court in December. As the attorneys leading the lawsuit point out, “control groups are necessary to the scientific method” — and particularly essential when it comes to assessing both the short- and long-term risks of vaccination. The attorneys represent The Control Group, which completed a pilot survey showing “1,248% better health for unvaccinated adults and 1,099% better health for unvaccinated children” compared with their vaccinated counterparts. If regulators and an acquiescent public continue with the willy-nilly “experimental biological alteration of the human immune system” — not only vaccinating “cradle to grave” but also pre-cradle — there will soon be no healthy, unvaccinated group left to compare against those who have been vaccinated.",partially false
5ed4cca9,"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Mitt Romney talks to the media after he filed to run for the United States Senate, in the Lt. Governor's office at the State Capitol, Thursday, March 15, 2018. Mitt Romney’s 2012 run as the GOP presidential nominee made him a household name in Utah. As it turns out, that past campaign also gave him a big financial head start for his U.S. Senate race here now. He transferred $1 million left over from his presidential campaign to his Senate push, according to disclosure forms made available by his campaign Tuesday. He may still have a few hundred thousand dollars more left in the presidential account. His year-end report for it previously had listed $1.3 million in cash on hand there. Including the $1 million transfer, Romney reported raising $1.68 million through April 1 this year for his Senate bid. He reported spending $526,516, and said he has $1.15 million in cash on hand. The big-money transfer — originating mostly from out-of-state donors — brought criticism from other candidates. “The $1 million is indicative of what we’re seeing from Mitt Romney. He’s bringing in national money to make this a national-profile race,” said Jenny Wilson, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the race. “I’m a Utahn running for Utahns,” she said, adding most candidates receive some national money but not as much as Romney is attracting. “Utahns need to ask if Mitt would represent the nation, or would he represent Utah.” Wilson’s disclosure form is not due for another week, because the Utah Democratic Convention is a week later than the state GOP convention. She said she expects to have a small fraction of cash on hand compared to Romney. “It’s challenging to compete against that kind of money,” said Larry Meyers, a St. George attorney who is one of 11 Republicans challenging Romney at the April 21 Utah Republican Convention. He figures he has raised about $15,000 total and has about $4,000 cash on hand. Meyers — a conservative running well to the right of Romney — figures he still has a shot as he has been campaigning hard among the 4,000 or so state delegates with phone calls, group meetings and one-on-one meetings. “I think the message matters more than the money.” Of course, Romney has also been working hard in such meetings — often offering a breakfast or lunch for delegates who come to listen to him. State Rep. Mike Kennedy, R-Alpine, another challenger to Romney, also complained about his $1 million transfer. “If he had millions of dollars left over from his presidential campaigns that include donations from special interests and people outside of Utah, why didn’t he use that money to win and defeat [Barack] Obama?” Kennedy’s disclosure form shows he loaned his campaign $251,143 — making up the bulk of the $289,000 he raised this period. He reports $257,488 in cash on hand. He has spent $31,535 so far. Disclosure forms for other Senate candidates had not yet appeared Tuesday on the Federal Election Commission’s website. They normally file forms first with the Senate, where they are digitized and provided to the FEC — which slows the process. As of Tuesday afternoon, the office of Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox reports it has verified 24,478 voter signatures so far out of the 28,000 needed by Romney to qualify for the primary election using that path to the ballot. The deadline to submit signatures is Monday. Romney is the only Republican U.S. Senate candidate gathering signatures. All others are hoping to qualify for the ballot just through the state convention, while Romney is using both paths. “I’m both a suspender and belt kind of guy,” Romney said earlier about using both paths to ensure his candidacy proceeds. If Romney wins 60 percent of delegate votes, he would eliminate all the other Republicans and proceed directly to the Nov. 6 general election. If no candidate wins 60 percent of the vote, the top two convention candidates proceed to a primary — plus Romney if he gathers enough signatures and is beaten at the convention. Romney’s new disclosure form includes some interesting donors — including former President George W. Bush, who gave him the maximum-allowed $8,100. Others who gave him the maximum-allowed $8,100 include Richard Marriott, chairman of Host Hotels and Resorts; Harris Simmons, chairman/CEO of Zions Bancorp.; and John Cumming, chairman of the ski-resort-owning Powdr Corp.",Alex Trebek Becomes U.S. Citizen,TRUE
bc815fa3,"President Vladimir Putin held his annual end-of-year press conference on Thursday, answering questions from state media and independent journalists on an array of topics related to Russia's domestic and foreign policy. Here are the highlights from the marathon presser that lasted four hours and 19 minutes: On constitutional term limits for the presidency: — One thing that could be changed about these [presidential] terms is removing the clause about 'successive' [terms]. Your humble servant served two terms consecutively, then left his post, but with the constitutional right to return to the post of president again, because these two terms were not successive. [This clause] troubles some of our political analysts and public figures. Well, maybe it could be removed. On climate change: — “But we're not really sure why global warming is happening, but we need to do something about it.” — “We have the greenest energy system in the world. New industries have been created: liquefied natural gas, hydropower. Those who believe that we live on old resources are deeply mistaken.” On U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment: — You phrase your question as if Trump's presidency is coming to an end. I am not sure that's the case. [The impeachment bill] still needs to go through the Senate where Republicans as far as I know have a majority. It's unlikely they will want to remove from power a representative of their party based on what are, in my opinion, completely fabricated reasons. On Russia’s spat with Germany over the killing of an ex-Chechen rebel in Berlin: — “The issue of extraditing Khangoshvili was discussed at the level of our special services but there was no official request, because we knew that it would be refused.” — “This is an absolute bloody killer. He killed 98 people in the Caucasus — think about it. He participated in the attacks in the Moscow metro.” On the election of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: — Johnson can be congratulated. He was victorious after all and had a better sense of the British public's mood than his political opponents. And as far as I understand, he intends to implement all of his Brexit plans. — In regards to [Russian] interference or non-interference, we've heard many times from official governing bodies in various countries, including Britain, assessments of what is happening inside Russia. Is that interference? On China: — We do not have a military alliance with China and we do not plan to create one. — But our relations with China continue to develop, including in the sphere of defence technologies... I think China is capable of producing its own ballistic missile early warning system, but with our help it can do so sooner. This will improve our strategic partner's ability to defend itself in a significant way. On the Libyan conflict: — Russia is in touch with [Libyan Prime Minister Fayez] al-Serraj and with [eastern Libyan commander Khalifa] Haftar. We are also constantly maintaining dialogue with our partners, including Turkey, Europe and other countries. — In our opinion, the best outcome would be for an agreement to be reached between the two conflicting sides that would lead to an end to military actions, and would establish who will rule the country, how, and what responsibilities they would have. On extending the New START arms control treaty with the U.S.: — We are ready until the end of the year to extend the existing agreement, the new START treaty. — But thus far there has been no answer to any of our suggestions. And without a new START treaty, there is nothing to curb an arms race. And that, in my opinion, is bad. On Russia’s doping scandal: — If WADA does not have any claims against our national Olympic Committee, then our team should be allowed to participate under its own flag. On Ukraine peace talks: — If a revision of the Minsk [peace] Agreements starts, then the situation could enter a complete dead end. — Direct dialogue on Donbass is needed. It is lacking. On internet freedom and the “foreign agents” law: — “Free internet and sovereign internet do not contradict each other. The [‘sovereign internet’] law is aimed only at preventing negative influence in case foreign resources are restricted.” — “We are not moving toward closing off the internet and are not going to do that.” — “It wasn’t us who coined the term ‘foreign agent.’ A similar law has been in force in the U.S. since the 1930s.”",Florida GOP candidates for governor weigh in on school board term limits,partially false
168e5898,"Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.",NHS fails thousands of new mothers with post-natal depression,other

1a6a1a97,"The number of children being considered for adoption has plummeted by 24 per cent in a year, despite an increase in those taken into care, official figures show. Adoption placement orders, which mean children are ruled eligible to be adopted, fell to just 7,320 between March 2014 and March 2015, according to the Department for Education’s latest Looked After Children statistics. Those placed for adoption also fell by 15 per cent in 2015 to 3,320. 69,540 The total number of looked after children in the UK up to March 2015 The fall comes as more children are being taken into care than at any time since 1986. At the end of March this year there were 69,540 looked after children, an increase of 6 per cent compared to 31 March 2011. The majority of these children live in foster care. Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo’s, said: “We are deeply concerned about the drastic 24 per cent fall in the number of children being put forward for adoption. It’s crucial that local authorities don’t shy away from acting decisively. These can be tough decisions but the best interests of vulnerable children must be put first. This could very soon become a real crisis with children waiting an unnecessary length of time in care – or even missing out completely on the chance of their own loving, safe and supportive family.” Earlier this year The Independent revealed how a series of rulings in the family courts had sent adoption rates into freefall. The problems began in November 2013 when the President of the Family Court, Sir James Munby, made a ruling that left many local authorities convinced they must try every extended family member before putting a child up for adoption. Two further rulings in January slowed down the process further. Sir James granted an appeal in a case in Liverpool where three children were taken away from a mother with a history of drug and alcohol abuse who was given no opportunity to prepare a case. He ruled that the “ruthlessly truncated process” employed by the earlier judge in the case was “unprincipled and unfair”. A second case decided by Mr Justice Keehan ruled that Northamptonshire County Council had made “egregious failures” in its handling of the case of a baby taken into care without proper assessments of the mother or the maternal grandparents in Latvia, where the baby was eventually placed. Data released for the first time this year also showed that more than 6,000 children went missing from care in the year to March 2015.

842ac903,"Rep. Leon Young figures the Wisconsin Legislature already works just part-time. So maybe it should get paid that way. Earlier this week, Young, D-Milwaukee, floated the idea of a constitutional amendment calling for lawmakers to meet just the first three months of the year and cut their pay by 75 percent — to $12,000 a year from the current $49,943. ""After reviewing the number of days that we were in session during the course of the 2011-12 biennium, I realized that we met a total of only 34 days out of a possible 122 session days,"" Young said. ""It is fair to say that we actually function as a 'de facto' part-time legislature now."" When you look only at the number of session days in 2012, Young said, the number drops to seven. ""Who works seven days and gets paid for a whole year?"" he asked. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Wisconsin is among 10 states where the salaries are highest, there are large staffs and ""legislators are paid enough to make a living without requiring outside income."" A similar proposal to cut the pay and budget of the Milwaukee County Board has been introduced and is gaining support among some Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature. That measure, being floated by state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, and Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-West Allis, would allow voters to decide whether to cut supervisors' pay to $15,000 a year from the current $51,000, eliminate health and pension benefits and make deep cuts in the board's $6.5 million annual budget. It will be interesting to see whether lawmakers view a part-time Legislature with the same enthusiasm as a part-time Milwaukee County Board. Young said he's gotten a ""couple of calls"" from fellow lawmakers in recent days, ""some in support; some not too happy, actually."" Rough times for Democracy Campaign The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, one of the state's strongest voices for government transparency, has hit a rough patch. Over the holidays, the Madison-based group was informed it would soon lose funding from the Joyce Foundation, which had supported the nonprofit for 16 years. Executive Director Mike McCabe said he is working to generate new sources of revenue to replace the $232,000 in lost Joyce funding. The Democracy Campaign's annual budget is $430,000 a year. McCabe said his highest priority is maintaining the group's searchable database that tracks donations to state candidates and associated research — which costs roughly $130,000 a year. ""We want to at least maintain our tracking program and searchable database and maintain the capacity to do research and analysis to connect the dots between all that (campaign) money and the votes at the Capitol,"" McCabe said. Some speculate that McCabe's often pointed critique of officials has generated more enemies than friends for the Democracy Campaign. ""I make no apologies for advocating for a system that values people over money,"" he said. ""I am bound and determined to keep this going."" If he fails, McCabe said, ""There will probably be some Capitol insiders that would be very happy.""",,FALSE
2c6d2cf7,"Trump official revises Statue of Liberty poem to defend migrant rule change Published 14 August 2019 image copyright Getty Images A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants. The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"". The official added the words ""who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge"". He later said the poem had referred to ""people coming from Europe"". Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new ""public charge"" requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future. image copyright Getty Images image caption The New Colossus was written by New York-born poet Emma Lazarus in 1883 The new regulation, known as a ""public charge rule"", was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October. The rule change is intended to reinforce ""ideals of self-sufficiency"", officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help. What did the official say? On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied. ""Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?"" asked NPR's Rachel Martin. image copyright Getty Images image caption Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services ""They certainly are,"" Mr Cuccinelli responded. ""Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge."" ""That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing,"" he added. The actual passage reads in part: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome ""who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition"". After the host asked if the policy ""appears to change the definition of the American dream,"" he said: ""We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. ""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American."" media caption Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target ""any particular group"" Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of ""twisting"" his comments. Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: ""Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class."" The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have ""excluded"" her family. ""I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN,"" she said. Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration ""think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people"". This administration finally admitted what we’ve known all along: They think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people. https://t.co/kTLl50yCmw — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) August 14, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Who will be affected by the new rule? Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change. It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants. But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change. Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country. Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected. An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected. President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration. What has reaction been? The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words ""vile and un-American"". ""It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out,"" the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli ""a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government"". Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality. Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: ""I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States."" ""I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things.","Even the South Pole Is Warming, and Quickly, Scientists Say",FALSE
