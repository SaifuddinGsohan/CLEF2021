f2182a54,HUGE! Attorney Sidney Powell CONFIRMS Alleged Dominion Servers in Germany Were Confiscated — VIDEO,"Last week Rep. Louie Gohmert told Chris Salcedo on Newsmax that people on the ground in Germany report that Scytl, which hosted elections data improperly through Spain, was raided by a large US ARMY force and their servers were seized in Frankfurt.  The video went viral.  Here is what Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) had to say about this alleged raid earlier today.  TRENDING: FBI Sends Out Warning Advising Against Buying, Making or Misrepresenting a Vaccine Card Which May Be ""Breaking the Law""  We later posted more information we received from our source on this raid in Germany.  From our source: The US government, once they determined that this Dominion server was involved in switching votes, then the intelligence community began a search for the server and discovered that the server was in Germany. In order to get access to that server and have it available for use in a legal manner they had to have the State Department work in tandem with the Department of Justice. They had to request that the government of Germany cooperate in allowing this seizure of this server. The appropriate documents required to affect that kind of seizure were put in place, signed off on, and it appears there was also US military support in this operation. The US military was not in the lead. But this helps explain why Esper was fired and Miller and Kash Patel were put in place — so that the military would not interfere with the operation in any way. By getting ahold of the server they now are going to have the direct evidence of when they were instructed to stop counting. They will also discover who gave the direction to stop counting and who initiated the algorithm that started switching votes. The CIA was completely excluded from this operation.

c5175d8d,Paul Ryan’s Worst Ally - The New York Times,"WHATEVER drama plays out when Republicans meet in Cleveland next week to nominate their party’s presidential candidate, the most consequential story line might well be the nationally televised debut of the awkward political partnership between Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican and thus chairman of the convention. But it offers just a sample of the spectacles sure to ensue between them should Mr. Trump become president.  How could Mr. Ryan, for years his party’s self-styled ideas guy, share power with a president whose ill-formed, often baffling ideas are in significant cases the opposite of his own, and of conservatives generally — on trade, Medicare and Social Security, immigration policy and more?  Could Mr. Ryan, as he suggests, really expect compromise from Mr. Trump, who has already served notice that Republican congressional leaders should “just be quiet” and leave running the country to him? Might Mr. Ryan even use the House’s legislative power to block some initiatives, though President Trump would be certain to claim a mandate for them? Where difficult trade-offs are needed to bring Trumpian ideas into legislative reality, can Mr. Ryan corral support from his fractious Republican colleagues (and even a few Democrats when necessary)?  That last question suggests another, bigger one that predates the Trump ascendance: Can Mr. Ryan himself compromise in the interest of getting legislation signed into law? Many in both parties have come to doubt it after 17 years in which the 46-year-old congressman from Wisconsin has held increasingly influential positions in the House, with Republicans holding a majority for all but four of those years.",TRUE

392886ea,Antifa gearing up for false flag violence disguised as Trump-supporters,"With merchants in Democrat-run cities boarding up their storefront windows, the possibility of serious urban violence is well understood. As horrific as that could get (ask anyone who lives in Minneapolis), the progressive fascists appear to have a plan in place to make it even worse: disguising their rioters as Trump-supporters in order to make the case that Donald Trump truly is a dictator that must be violently overthrown if he wins or arrested and prosecuted if he loses.  A source that has always been reliable was able to photograph an Antifa flyer:  What makes all of this particularly chilling is that progressives already are absurdly claiming that the threat of violence comes from our side. Portland's Mayor Ted Wheeler warns of white racist rioters inspired by the rhetoric from Washington, D.C. (i.e., Trump):  Given the heightened concerns about potential violence, particularly from white supremist organizations and the divisive rhetoric from Washington, D.C., the need for coordination and partnership takes on statewide significance. Oregon is likely to be a flashpoint. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) November 2, 2020  Other media players, such Vox and the New York Times, warn of both sides, a disguise of balance but ridiculously unrealistic, considering the utter lack of property destruction by the right and massive destruction at the hands of the left since Gorge Floyd's death in police custody.  Tucker Carlson and Lisa Boothe last night addressed Ted Wheeler's warning and correctly pointed out its absurdity. As they noted, if merchants believed that white supremacists were the threat, they would not be spray-painting ""We support Black Lives Matter"" on their plywood window coverings. If they thought Ted Wheeler were for real, not a vicious liar, they would spray white power rhetoric. The segment begins at about 1:30 in the video below (courtesy of Media Matters!):  Dan Crenshaw makes a similar point:  Trump’s chaos?

bc6d5d55,Remarks by President Biden on the Administration’s COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts,"State Dining Room  4:22 P.M. EST  THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, folks. The Vice President and I have some good news to report, and I’d like to make two key announcements today related to our COVID-19 vaccination effort.  As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening — open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal.  But that’s — one of my first goals in office was — when I got into office was to say that there will be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We’ve got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we’ll make it all the way.  As I — and as I’ve said, we have a long way to go, but, you know, as I said from the outset, we’re going to use every resource of the federal government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came into office was that Johnson & Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we pote- — while we had the potential of another highly effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn’t coming fast enough. So my team — my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.  As I’ve always said, this was a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches.  And today, we’re announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world — that are usually competitors — are working together on the vaccine. Johnson & Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two.  We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7.  In addition, we’ll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.  I’ve also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s efforts. And I want to thank Johnson & Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis.  Here’s what all this means: We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.  Let me say that again: When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About three weeks ago, we were able to say that we’ll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July.  And I’m pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I’ve ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply — I’ll say it again — for every adult in America by the end of May. By the end of May. That’s progress — important progress.  But it’s not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people’s arms, millions of Americans’ arms.  To date, we’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses. We’ve developed — we deployed more than 1,500 federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency — FEMA — and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands of more to come.  We’re also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We’ve sent millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot.  The federal government is also working with states to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill and I just visited one in Houston last week. It’s incredible.  And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely.  Right now, an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents; they understand. We’re already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation.  Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed. And remote learning isn’t the same for every student, as you all know.  Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs.  Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for — and further undermining the health of our economy.  This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal of having a majority of our K-through-8 schools open by the end of my first 100 days as President.  To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely — reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus. All cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week, and I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well.  You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely. It’s a roadmap that will enable schools — if they have the resources they deserve — to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I’ve asked Congress to give them the tools. And today, to add one more tool to school reopening: a vaccinated workforce.  Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we’ve heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that.  So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let’s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers who provide that service — educators, school staff, childcare workers — get them vaccinated immediately. They’re essential workers.  Over 30 states have already taken step to prior- –prioritize educators for vaccination. And today, I’m using the full authority of the federal government. I’m directing every state to do the same. My challenge to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.  To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month — the month of March, we will be using our federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and child-care workers. Throughout March, they will be able to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K-through-12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them.  And I want to be very clear: Not every educator will be able to get their appointment in the first week, but our goarl [sic] — goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March.  I want to conclude with this: We’re making progress from the mess we inherited. We’re moving in the right direction. And today’s announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over. I told you I’d be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South. But our administration will never take this public health threat lightly.  Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks — keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I’ve asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now is not the time to let our guard down. People’s lives are at stake.  We have already — we have already — and I carry this in my pocket — lost more — as of today, we’ve lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It’s got to stop.  We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing states for their efforts.  We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now. Now.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can’t assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That’s how we’re going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.  So thank you. And please, please, it’s not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much.  Q Mr. President, based on the news you announced, when do you think things will get back to normal? When do you think things will get back to normal?  THE PRESIDENT: When do I think things will get back to normal? I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure. But my hope is, by this time next year, we’re going to be back to normal, and before that — my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue — continue to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There’s a lot we have to do yet. So thank you.  Q Did you receive a briefing about the border today?  THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I did.  Q What did you learn?  THE PRESIDENT: A lot.  Q Is there a crisis at the border, sir?  THE PRESIDENT: No, we’ll be able to handle it, God willing.  4:34 P.M. EST",partially false

b8437efb,BOMBSHELL: Covid-19 infection rate may be 440% higher among children who received FLU SHOTS… while health “authorities” madly push more shots for the coming flu season,"(Natural News) A 2012 study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases finds that children who received inactivated influenza vaccines were 440% more likely (relative risk: 4.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-14.8) to acquire infections of respiratory viral pathogens which are not influenza. With the aggressive push for influenza immunizations now under way, the medical establishment may be setting up children to be extremely vulnerable to coronavirus infections.  Titled, “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine,” the study is found at this link at the National Library of Medicine:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/  The study finds that flu shots quite literally inactivate parts of the human immune system, rendering the child more vulnerable to coronavirus infections. “Being protected against influenza, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses,” the study authors write.  The study authors explain that the influenza vaccine works to prevent influenza virus infections, but at the same time it makes children more susceptible to other respiratory infections. Since the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for seasonal influenza is so low (around 0.024%, which is not a typo), and the Infection Fatality Rate of covid-19 infections is at least one order of magnitude higher, it raises the obvious question:  Would it save more lives of children to avoid administering flu shots this year and therefore reduce their vulnerability to covid-19, which has a far higher fatality rate?  The study, which was conducted in 2009, observed the outcomes of 115 children aged 6 – 16 years. The study also used a placebo group and found that placebo made “no statistically significant difference” in the risk of acute respiratory infection risk.  But children who received influenza vaccines had a much higher risk of respiratory infections.  Even more shockingly, the study also found no difference in the risk of seasonal influenza infections between those children who were vaccinated vs. those who weren’t. In other words, the influenza vaccine offered no protection against the flu, but it created increased vulnerability to other respiratory infections. (No benefits, just increased risks.) “There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between recipients of TIV or placebo,” the study explains.  You can see the increased number of respiratory infections in this chart. Note the “TIV” column means those children who were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine:  The conclusion is that influenza vaccines make children more susceptible to other respiratory viral infections. From the study, which took place more than a decade before the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic:  We identified a statistically significant increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients (Table 3), including significant increases in the risk of rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus infection, which were most frequently detected in March 2009, immediately after the peak in seasonal influenza activity in February 2009.  The study authors point out that the influenza vaccine, “could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism,” although they also state more research is needed because some of the self-reporting of symptoms may have introduced “artifacts” which could sway the numbers. Nevertheless, the study authors also state that this phenomenon of “viral interference” is well known:  Participants who received TIV would have been protected against influenza in February 2009 but then would not have had heightened nonspecific immunity in the following weeks… The phenomenon of virus interference has been well known in virology for >60 years [24–27]. Ecological studies have reported phenomena potentially explained by viral interference [3–11]… Interference in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections has been reported after receipt of live oral poliovirus vaccine [29–32].  Those who push flu shots may be worsening the coronavirus pandemic  The upshot of this research is that those who are pushing flu shots for children may in fact be worsening the coronavirus pandemic, creating “perfect storm” conditions for children to become carriers of the Wuhan coronavirus that causes covid-19.  This is consistent with the fact that we now know the medical establishment has acted to deliberately worsen covid-19 fatalities by, for example, conspiring the destroy the credibility of hydroxychloroquine, working to maximize fatalities in order to reap a windfall of profits from the coronavirus vaccine.  Yes, the medical and science establishment quite literally arranges for more people to die in order to keep the coronavirus fear alive, resulting in more demand for high-profit vaccines.  As always, it’s all about the money. As Gary Heavin recently wrote in a warning to America, Big Pharma operatives are “accessories to murder.”  How does Big Pharma have so much control over the dissemination of this information or should I say propaganda? Well, the same answer pops up again, money. Big Pharma gave $2 billion dollars during the last election cycle to US politicians. Big AG, the military/security complex and big oil each gave only a paltry $1.0 billion dollars to buy the votes of our political leadership.  The MSM counts Big Pharma’s advertising revenue at up to 80% of their income. The internet’s “masters of the universe” also kowtow to Big Pharma’s influence and advertising dollars by censoring anyone who tries to tell the American people the truth about Covid 19.  It certainly appears that anyone who is complicit in this Great Deception, a deception that is designed to kill and terrify enough people to ultimately beg for an experimental vaccine, well, these people would be accessories to murder.  Flu shots are being hyped to suppress immune systems and create an explosion in coronavirus infections  Flu shots, it seems, are one more way the medical establishment can literally murder children and adults, creating widespread vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic which will no doubt surge back this Fall as flu shots work to suppress the immune systems of millions.  Recognize that the people pushing flu shots are medical murderers, and many are deliberately trying to kill as many people as possible to create demand for the high-profit coronavirus vaccines that are about to be unleashed on America, probably before the end of this year.  It’s the perfect crime: Manufacture vaccines that suppress the immune system right in the middle of a pandemic, causing more infections and deaths, leading to more calls for mandatory vaccines. The drug companies will cash in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars while innocent children and adults all across America needlessly suffer and die.  As usual, it’s all about the money, and the vaccine / drug cartels are murderous, criminal regimes that twisted science (Dr. Fauci?) to maximize profits at any cost.

faf024d6,Marine Corps. Rebukes Pelosi: “WE DON’T WORK FOR YOU!”,"Latest Breaking News: Martial Law Imminent  General David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps., refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to use the Corps. to safeguard Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration from Trump supporters and insurrectionists.  A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night.  Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.  Her statement made the general explode, our source said.  “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said.  Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress.  “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.  Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”  Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”  Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.  “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen. Berger allegedly told her.  Please help support alternative media. We follow the truth, wherever it leads. We reject absolutely big-tech and the narrow, dogmatic views of MSM.

daafc154,Scott Walker still owes $1 million for presidential campaign,"Gov. Scott Walker said Friday his presidential campaign remains $1 million in the red, despite a spurt of fundraising in the final quarter of 2015. Credit: Associated Press  By of the  Madison— Scott Walker's former presidential campaign still owes more than $1 million, despite raising $500,000 in the last three months of 2015.  Also Friday, the Republican governor said he's dropping the practice his political operations adopted last year of paying for the travel costs to campaign events for Walker's state security team. Taxpayers will now, as they did before the presidential campaign, foot the costs of both the travel and salaries of the governor's security when he leaves the state for political events.  As of the end of last year, Walker's White House campaign had about $1.2 million in obligations left and about $153,000 in cash that partially offsets those debts.  Though Walker has raised nearly $8 million for his short run, his operation spent the cash faster than he could raise it over the campaign's 71-day life, and he dropped out of the 2016 presidential race in September.  A report filed Friday with federal elections officials shows the resulting burden won't be an easy one, even for the best political fundraiser in state history.  ""Governor Walker made substantial progress in addressing financial commitments over the last quarter, and he remains humbled by the outpouring of support from friends across the country who continue to believe in his common sense reform agenda,"" spokesman Joe Fadness said.  The filings show Walker still owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to a number of companies, including fundraising and communications consultants, direct mail companies, and photographers and video producers.  His highest debts include: $317,000 to FLS Connect LLC, a Minnesota-based telemarketing company; $82,000 to a Washington, D.C.-based legal consulting company, Jones Day; $70,000 to SCM Associates, a New Hampshire based direct mail printing company; $59,000 to the Lukens Co., an Arlington-based direct mail printing company; $44,000 in event staging expenses to MMA Events, a Maryland-based company; and $39,000 to an Alexandria-based video production company, Sharp Politics.  Walker also got some help from his state campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker, which purchased $14,682 of items from the presidential campaign.  And he rented his voter list to Voter Gravity Inc., and Granite Lists LLC, for $20,000 and $15,700.70, respectively.  The governor did make some progress paying off his debts in the wake of his failed presidential bid.  He had owed about $10,500 to the Waukesha County Expo Center, where he officially launched his 2016 campaign in July, but paid that bill in full.  Walker also refunded 152 contributions for a total of $407,546.24.  Walker's presidential campaign took in $2.4 million and $1.2 million during July and August. Those figures dropped off dramatically in September, with $484,521, and October, with $35,279. The campaign still managed to break six figures in individual contributions in November and December, bringing in $127,498 and $151,334, respectively.  Also Friday, Walker's affiliated Unintimidated PAC reported that it took in $3.7 million in itemized receipts in the last half of 2015. The grand majority of that money came from two families: Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein contributed $2.5 million; and Mary and Mike Shannon of Milwaukee contributed another $500,000. Richard Uihlein is CEO of Pleasant Prairie-based Uline Corp. Mike Shannon is the CEO of KSL Capital Partners.  The PAC filed termination papers Friday.  State officials also said Friday that in the future, Walker's political operations will no longer reimburse state taxpayers for his security team's travel expenses.  Walker's political operations have reimbursed state taxpayers $260,000 to cover hotel stays, airfare and other travel expenses last year for his security team. But in the future, taxpayers will have to pay such costs when state troopers accompany Walker on political trips, said Jim Dick, a spokesman for the state Department of Administration.  Walker decided last year to have his political operations pick up some of those costs while he crisscrossed the country and traveled overseas as he explored and launched his presidential campaign.  But Walker is returning to the previous practice as used by other governors of both parties. Democrat Jim Doyle, for instance, brought security along on his travels to political and other events, such as a December 2010 visit to Cancun for a United Nation climate change conference.  The Wisconsin governor was an early favorite in the Republican field after surging in the wake of a January 2015 speech in Iowa, but then began to flounder as real estate mogul Donald Trump surged and Walker had to clarify statements about birthright citizenship and building a wall on Canada's border.

The bottom line is that if you are not sick, you should not wear a face mask. As businesses reopen, many are requiring shoppers and employees to wear a face mask. Costco, for instance, will not allow shoppers into the store without wearing a face mask. Many employers are requiring all employees to wear a face mask while at work. In some jurisdictions, all citizens must wear a face mask if they are outside of their own home. ⁃ TN Editor  With the advent of the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. One of these measures is the wearing of facial masks, either a surgical-type mask, bandana or N95 respirator mask. When this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior, it was assumed that it would behave, in terms of spread among communities, like other respiratory viruses. Little has presented itself after intense study of this virus and its behavior to change this perception.  This is somewhat of an unusual virus in that for the vast majority of people infected by the virus, one experiences either no illness (asymptomatic) or very little sickness. Only a very small number of people are at risk of a potentially serious outcome from the infection—mainly those with underlying serious medical conditions in conjunction with advanced age and frailty, those with immune compromising conditions and nursing home patients near the end of their lives. There is growing evidence that the treatment protocol issued to treating doctors by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mainly intubation and use of a ventilator (respirator), may have contributed significantly to the high death rate in these select individuals.  By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. Russell Blaylock, MD  As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, “ None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”1 Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission.  It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history.  Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications.  There is a difference between the N95 respirator mask and the surgical mask (cloth or paper mask) in terms of side effects. The N95 mask, which filters out 95% of particles with a median diameter >0.3 µm2 , because it impairs respiratory exchange (breathing) to a greater degree than a soft mask, and is more often associated with headaches. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males and 165 females) asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.2  How is Coronavirus Getting Into the Brain? Vaccine Reaction  They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation (hypoxia) or an elevation in blood C02 (hypercapnia). It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death.  A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask.3 Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance.  Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind—which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung.  While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well. In this study, researchers examined the blood oxygen levels in 53 surgeons using an oximeter. They measured blood oxygenation before surgery as well as at the end of surgeries.4 The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels (pa02) significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels.  The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.5,6,7  People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers.8,9 Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular (strokes) diseases.10  There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.  It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain.11,12 In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.13  It is evident from this review that there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mask of any kind can have a significant impact in preventing the spread of this virus. The fact that this virus is a relatively benign infection for the vast majority of the population and that most of the at-risk group also survive, from an infectious disease and epidemiological standpoint, by letting the virus spread through the healthier population we will reach a herd immunity level rather quickly that will end this pandemic quickly and prevent a return next winter. During this time, we need to protect the at-risk population by avoiding close contact, boosting their immunity with compounds that boost cellular immunity and in general, care for them.  One should not attack and insult those who have chosen not to wear a mask, as these studies suggest that is the wise choice to make.  References  bin-Reza F et al.

4461868e,Kamala Harris Says She Supports Your Second Amendment Rights. Her Record Proves Otherwise,"We knew that Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick wasn’t going to be an NRA member or a Second Amendment supporter, but that doesn’t mean he had to pick someone who actually argued in 2008 that Washington, D.C.’s ban on handguns didn’t violate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala Harris signed on to an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court in the Heller case, arguing that “for nearly 70 years courts have consistently sustained criminal firearms laws against Second Amendment challenges by holding that, inter alia, (i) the Second Amendment provides only a militia-related right to bear arms, (ii) the Second Amendment does not apply to legislation passed by state or local governments, and (iii) the restrictions bear a reasonable relationship to protecting public safety and thus do not violate a personal constitutional right.”  The brief, written by Adrian Fenty (at the time the Attorney General for Washington, D.C.) urged the Supreme Court to uphold the District’s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a firearms storage law requiring guns to be kept locked up or disassembled with ammunition stored separately. To do otherwise, claimed Fenty, Harris, and several other prosecutors, would create “a broad private right to possess any firearm that is a ‘lineal descendant’ of a founding era weapon and that is in ‘common use’ with a ‘military application’ today.”  Create a right. In other words, Kamala Harris told the Supreme Court that Americans didn’t have an individual right to possess a firearm that is in common use, turning a right of the people into a privilege to be exercised by a chosen few.  Harris lost the argument in 2008, but she’s been opposing the right to keep and bear arms ever since. As District Attorney, Harris demanded an end to gun shows at the Cow Palace convention center just outside of the San Francisco city limits, and as California’s Attorney General she not only defended the state’s gun control laws in court, but according to California Rifle & Pistol Association president Chuck Michel, she failed to properly oversee several databases that the state uses to determine whether or not someone is eligible to own a firearm.  .. not one but two separate Reports from the California State Auditor have found serious problems with the way the DOJ processes mental health records to determine a person’s firearm eligibility. Despite these multiple admonitions, Harris has failed to fix the problems. A 2013 Report from the California State Auditor found that under Harris, the DOJ “had not sufficiently reached out to the courts or mental health facilities to remind them to promptly report required information,” which if done would have allowed the DOJ to determine when dangerously mentally ill persons were in possession of firearms or attempting to purchase them. Additionally, this report found that: [K]ey decisions, such as whether a person is prohibited, are left to staff whose work does not receive a supervisory review. Because of these issues, Justice cannot identify all armed prohibited persons in California as effectively as it should, and the information it uses to ensure public safety by confiscating firearms is incomplete.  As U.S. Senator, Kamala Harris has backed bans on so-called assault weapons, universal background check mandates, and more, but it was her short-lived presidential campaign that really allowed her to once again tout her anti-gun agenda. Harris proclaimed that if she was elected president, she would enact gun control with or without the support of Congress.  “Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. We need action, and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I’m elected, I’ll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don’t, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country, because it is time to act.”  Expect the media to highlight the fact that Harris says she owns a gun, in order to portray her as some sort of “moderate” on the issue of the right to keep and bear arms. She’s not a moderate. She’s a hypocrite. Here’s what she told a CNN townhall audience last April.  “I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do — for personal safety,” the California Democrat said Thursday. “I was a career prosecutor.”  Remember, as a career prosecutor Harris argued that you and I don’t have a right to own a handgun for personal safety, and that local governments should be able to ban you and I from legally possessing one. As a member of law enforcement, of course Harris would have been exempt from the very gun bans she wanted to keep in place in Washington, D.C., but she wanted local governments to be able to strip you of your ability to legally own a firearm for self-defense. Harris may own a gun, but that doesn’t mean she believes that you have a right to own one too.",FALSE
c69de08e,Wisconsin Election Commission Directive Allows Clerks To ‘Fix’ Ballots [UPDATED],"This article has been updated to include more context about the directive as well as the commission’s defense of its policy.  A new report points out that an executive branch agency called the Wisconsin Election Commission issued a directive in October telling local county election clerks that they can “fix” ballots by filling in missing addresses for witnesses. According to one former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice, the policy, which has been in place since October 2016, may violate a Wisconsin law requiring ballots to have a witness address to be validated. The commission has defended its policy, however, stating that the law “does not specify who affixes the address.”  Wisconsin Statute 6.87(6d) states, “If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted.”  But in August, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a memo telling clerks they could fill in the address of the voter:  To make sure your ballot is counted, double check the following before you return it: Your voter information: this section is usually completed by your clerk and includes the date of the election, the county and municipality in which you are registered, your name, the address where you are registered, city, and zip code. Voter Signature: you (or your assistant) must sign in the Certification of Voter section. Witness Signature and Address: your witness must sign and provide their full address, (street number, street name, city) in the Certification of Witness section. Make sure your ballot is in your envelope and make sure the envelope is sealed properly. If any of the required information above is missing, your ballot will not be counted.  In October, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a directive to the state’s county clerks that seemed to allow them to fix incomplete (or “spoiled”) ballots missing witness signatures, writing, “Please note that the clerk should attempt to resolve any missing witness address information prior to Election Day if possible and this can be done through reliable information (personal knowledge, voter registration information, through a phone call with the voter or witness). The witness does not need to appear to add a missing address.”  As noted by Wisconsin Election Commission public information officer Reid Magney, the guidance has been in place since October 2016. “The guidance has been in effect for 11 statewide elections, including the 2016 presidential and presidential recount, and no one has objected to it until now,” said Magney, as reported by USA Today.  An Oct. 18, 2016 memo from the commission reads in part (formatting adjusted):  [T]he Commission’s guidance is that municipal clerks shall do all that they can reasonably do to obtain any missing part of the witness address. Those steps may include one or more of the following options: 1. The clerk is able to reasonably discern the missing address or address component by information appearing on the envelope or from some other source, such as: The voter has provided his or her complete address and the clerk has personal knowledge that the witness resides at the same address as the voter.  The clerk has personal knowledge of the witness and knows his/or her address.  The voter’s complete address appears on the address label, and the witness indicates the same street address as the voter.  The clerk is able to utilize lists or databases at his or her disposal to determine the witness’s address. 2. The voter or witness may wish to appear in person to add the missing information, or provide the address information by phone, fax, email or mail. The voter may provide the address separately as an alternative to returning the certificate envelope and having the voter mail it back again as outlined below. 3. The voter may request that the clerk return the certificate envelope so the voter can personally add the witness address. […] 4. The voter may wish to spoil the original ballot and vote a new one.  Derek Muller, a professor of law at the Iowa School of Law, told Just The News, “This is a complication thing about elections like this. I’ve seen it in a lot of jurisdictions, what might be sort of a technical violation of the statute, in this case encouragement to county clerks about how to use their judgment on whether or not to cure a ballot.”  Retired Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman told WISN, “The statute is very, very clear. If an absentee ballot does not have a witness address on it, it’s not valid. That ballot is not valid.”  “In defiance of and direct contradiction to the statute, the Wisconsin Elections Commission gave guidance — that is, cover —to all 72 county clerks and turned the statute on its head,” said Gableman. “They said, ‘Gee, we know the law says an absentee ballot without the witness address is not valid, but county clerk, you have a duty to go ahead and look up on your own the witness’ address if there’s no address on the absentee ballot.’”  The Wisconsin Election Commission, however, maintains that its policies are not in violation of the law, asserting that the law “does not specify who affixes the address” and noting that the addresses have been added to the certificates rather than the ballots themselves, as AFP reports.

3c2b01de,Trump Is the Worst Kind of Socialist,"“America will never be a socialist country,” President Trump said as he launched his bid for re-election last week. That declaration was an effort to frighten Americans and undermine growing support for expanding Medicare and Social Security—two popular programs that have long been derided as “socialist.” Mr. Trump’s declaration hypocritically ignores that he and his Republican colleagues are the nation’s leading purveyors of an insidious form of corporate socialism, which uses government power and taxpayer resources to enrich Mr. Trump and his billionaire friends. When we defeat Mr. Trump in this election, we are going to end his corporate socialism and use those resources to create a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights that benefits all people. Consider the corporate socialism we’ve seen on Wall Street, where the high priests of unfettered capitalism reign. As you will recall, Wall Street’s deification of “free markets” went out the window in 2008 as they watched the financial crisis caused by their own greed and illegal behavior threaten the existence of some of the largest financial institutions in the country. Suddenly, Wall Street became strong supporters of big-government socialism. They begged the federal government for unprecedented taxpayer assistance, and Congress provided them with the largest bailout in history. The major banks received some $700 billion from the Treasury and trillions in low-interest loans from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, working people all across the country lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings. The most vulnerable were hit the hardest, with the African-American community losing half its wealth. That was not an aberration. The norm across the corporate world is what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called “socialism for the rich, and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.” If you are a fossil-fuel company, whose carbon emissions are destroying the planet, Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans offer billions in government subsidies, including special tax breaks, royalty relief and funding for research and development. But if you are struggling to pay your utility bill, you get the free market—higher and higher electric bills. If you are a pharmaceutical company, you make huge profits on patent rights for medicines that were developed with taxpayer-funded research. But if you are a taxpayer, you get the free market and pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs—and in some cases you die because you cannot afford the medication you need. If you are a monopoly like Amazon, owned by the wealthiest person in the U.S., you get hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives from taxpayers to build warehouses, yet you end up paying not one penny in federal income taxes. But if you are a small business that falls behind on your store’s rent, you get the free market—which means you get an eviction notice. If you are the billionaire Walton family, state and local governments grant you free land and subsidies and build infrastructure for your stores, even as Walmart’s tax-avoidance schemes drain local towns of public revenues. But if you are a Walmart worker, you get the free market—which means starvation wages. If you are the Trump family, you got $885 million worth of tax breaks and subsidies for your family’s housing empire, which was built on racial discrimination. But if you are a homeowner struggling to pay your mortgage, you get the free market—which means foreclosure. The time is long overdue for the U.S. to end corporate socialism for Mr. Trump and the rest of the billionaire class. Instead, those resources should be put to work to ensure shared prosperity by enhancing Social Security and Medicare and investing in roads and bridges, public schools, clean water and clean air. Mr. Trump believes in corporate socialism to protect the wealth and power of the rich. I believe the U.S. must end corporate socialism and instead fulfill President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s vision of enshrining basic economic rights for all Americans. These include the rights to health care, a living wage, a decent job, a quality education, a secure retirement, affordable housing and a clean environment. We can make this 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights a reality with initiatives like Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, a Green New Deal, student-debt cancellation and legislation to expand Social Security. I recognize that this agenda will face enormous opposition from corporate America and the 1%. They have a vested interest in protecting the corporate socialism that has enriched and empowered them. The wealthiest three families now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country, and they will do everything they can to block our agenda. But more Americans are noticing the contradiction between coddled socialism for the rich and the destruction of opportunity for everyone else. I am confident that we will be able to build a grass-roots movement that will not only defeat Donald Trump in this election but finally create a government that works for all people, not just the billionaire class.

fb721890,"WisDems: Farmers have been crushed by Trump’s failed COVID-19 response, but he’s been dragging them down his entire presidency","(WISCONSIN) — Trump’s failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin and across the country. Farmers have been dumping milk, setting their crops on fire, and euthanizing their livestock because there is no market for their products. All the while, millions of more Americans are going hungry because they lost their jobs.  But farmers were struggling long before coronavirus hit the United States. Trump’s chaotic trade wars, particularly with China, obliterated the markets Wisconsin farmers spent decades building in just a short few months. During this time Trump and his administration told Wisconsinites the pain would be “temporary,” that farmers were “over the hump,” and that small and medium-sized family farms should just get bigger if they want to survive.  Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his reelection chances. He used their pain to push through a multi-billion dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies. After getting rolled by China on a trade deal that was a mere fraction of what he promised it would be, a recent news report confirms that Trump was never interested in bettering the lives of Wisconsin’s farmers and was simply looking out for his own political interests.  “Donald Trump crushed our farmers and the local economies they support because he only sees them as a bargaining chip, not human beings and Wisconsinites,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman said. “Trump has been a lapdog for China as he has rolled over for them at every turn. It’s been made clear by recent news reports that Trump gambled with farmers’ livelihoods because he thought it would be good for his reelection prospects. But after decimating these communities, they’re not willing to give him another four years — they know they can’t afford it.”  Wisconsin Examiner: Farms go from frying pan of trade wars to fire of COVID-19  Coxhead said trade policies under President Donald Trump…contributed significantly to the plight of Wisconsin farmers in the last few years. The federal government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic has further endangered the country’s — and Wisconsin’s — position in the world economy, he added.  Wisconsin State Farmer: Economic recovery after pandemic will be slow for farmers due to trade and internet issues  He also said the Trump administration’s volatile relationship with China, one of the country’s biggest trading partners, is a cause for concern. And a widespread lack of high-speed internet access in rural areas is causing many rural economies to fall behind entirely. “The global economic recovery, which will outpace the United States, is not really going to benefit us all that well because the administration has turned its back on international trade,” Coxhead said.  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Coronavirus has hit Wisconsin dairy farms especially hard — some farmers may even have to dump milk  Coronavirus is delivering a blow to Wisconsin agriculture…export markets are threatened by global trade unrest, and some farms may not make it through the spring. “The coronavirus outbreak has caused milk prices to drop down to unprofitable levels this spring…We also need to be prepared for the scenarios that would require our members to dump milk”…”or dispose of (it) in some other manner,”…the stimulus package won’t resolve long-term issues such as increased global competition and trade wars that may arise from countries closing their borders to curb the spread of COVID-19.

5a228e0e,Merck Scraps COVID Vaccines; Says It’s More Effective To Get The Virus And Recover,"Vaccine manufacturer Merck has abandoned development of two coronavirus vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing antibodies.  The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection.  The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482.  The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus.  “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug.  Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed.  Chief Marketing Officer Michael Nally recently told Bloomberg that Merck is aiming to produce some 20 million courses of the MK-4482 drug, an oral antiviral which patients will take twice a day for five days.  Meanwhile, in related news, German scientists have claimed that the UK Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is less than 8% effective in over 65s, prompting the vaccine developers to hit back, rubbishing the claims.  The German media published the claims, alleging it had been ‘confirmed’ by ‘multiple’ unnamed senior German government sources.  UK government ministers have suggested that the claim could be related to the ongoing dispute over delivery of the vaccine between the European Union and AstraZeneca.  The EU, which is yet to approve the vaccine, has threatened to block exports of shots to Britain, in a move that has been branded ‘spiteful’ by British government sources.  In an effort to make sure its member states get their ‘fair share’ of vaccines, the EU has also threatened to block the delivery of Pfizer vaccines to the UK, demanding that drug companies provide detailed information on when they plan to export Covid jabs to countries outside the bloc.",partially false
3bc38092,U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin,"U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Stands Up for Wisconsin Dairy Farmers  Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act fights back against non-dairy products that are mislabeled as milk, yogurt and cheese  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin applaud the reform  WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin stood up for Wisconsin dairy farmers and introduced legislation today to combat the unfair practice of mislabeling non-dairy products. The Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act (DAIRY PRIDE Act) would require non-dairy products made from nuts, seeds, plants, and algae to no longer be mislabeled with dairy terms such as milk, yogurt or cheese.  “Dairy farmers in Wisconsin work tirelessly every day to ensure that their milk meets high standards for nutritional value and quality,” said Senator Baldwin. “Imitation products have gotten away with using dairy’s good name for their own benefit, which is against the law and must be enforced. Mislabeling of plant-based products as ‘milk’ hurts our dairy farmers. That’s why I’ve authored the DAIRY PRIDE Act to take a stand for Wisconsin farmers and the quality products they make.”  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin are strongly supporting Senator Baldwin’s reform:  “Finally after all these years, it’s about time someone stands up for the American Dairy farmer. We are held to higher quality and animal care standard every year to keep milk safe. It’s not fair that the name milk should be used by non-dairy drinks to further erode what little profit we have,” said Jerry Croes, member of the Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery in Deer Park, WI.  “As a proud Wisconsin Dairy Farmer, I support Tammy Baldwin’s efforts to introduce the DAIRY PRIDE Act. I know the economic struggles we dairy farmers face on a daily basis, as I am also an Ag Lender, helping through the low milk prices of 2015 and 2016. We don’t need competition from plant-based drinks being labeled as milk and sending a false message to consumers, and also falsely advertising them as being better than cow’s milk. When compared on nutrients and price, cow’s milk still comes out on top. I am opposed to all false labeling of food products that aren’t true dairy products,” said Jim Smidel of Brothers Smidel Farms, LLP in Kewaunee, WI.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, the increasingly common practice of labeling beverages as milk when they quite obviously are not is wrong and misleading. Senator Baldwin’s bill simply asks FDA to enforce current regulations meant to uphold the standards of identity, and integrity, of milk,” said Brad Nevin, Dairy farmer and member-owner of Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) in Rice Lake, WI.  “Consumers deserve to be treated with respect and that begins with proper and accurate food labels. Milk is clearly defined by the FDA, and this definition should also be enforced. It’s about time the FDA upheld its responsibility of enforcing existing labeling requirements, especially when it comes to dairy,” said John Rettler of Tin Valley Farms in Neosho, WI.    “Dairy has built a strong reputation as a reliable source of important nutrients we need daily. To use these dairy terms on plant-based products undermines the real value that dairy provides in the form of naturally occurring Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin A among others. Consumers associate dairy with the nutrients they need, and those are naturally occurring in milk from cows,” said Janet Clark of Vision Aire Farms in Eldorado, WI.  “Thank you, Senator Baldwin, for taking the initiative to protect the definition of milk, cheese and yogurt. Your advocacy supports the hard and honest work of dairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the nation, and more importantly, supports clear and accurate information to be shared on food labels, something consumers deserve,” said David Cooper, General Manager of FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison, WI.  “The FDA has already clearly defined milk, and liquid from a plant does not fit this definition. Existing regulation should be enforced, reserving the use of the term ‘milk’ exclusively for those products that deliver the nutritional value only found in dairy. We thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership on this matter,” said Mark Frederixon, Blair Division Manager of Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) in Blair, WI.  Dairy producer coalitions and groups around the country are also applauding the legislation:  “For too long, the FDA has turned a blind eye to the misbranding of imitation dairy products, despite the decades-old federal law that milk comes from animals, not vegetables or nuts. None of these imitators provides the same high quality and quantity of nutrition offered by real milk. Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act will simply ensure that FDA enforces current law by requiring marketers of these imitation products to call them something other than milk,” said Jim Mulhern, President and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation.  “Dairy farmers invest a great deal of time and money to produce a wholesome, nutritious product for consumers, and take pride in the milk they produce. The federal government has promised to ensure that the term “milk” on store shelves can only be used on dairy products. But they have fallen short on that promise. The bill introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin will help ensure that products labeled as milk are indeed dairy products. Consumers and dairy farmers alike will be the beneficiaries of this effort,” said Steve Etka of the Midwest Dairy Coalition.  ""The Wisconsin Dairy Products Association. which represents processors that manufacture a wide range of dairy products, supports Senator Baldwin’s legislation which protects the integrity and image of wholesome and nutritious dairy products,"" said Bradley Legreid, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Dairy Products Association.  ""Wisconsin Farmers Union fully supports the introduction and swift passage of the DAIRY PRIDE Act. Our grassroots, member-driven policy opposes any changes in the FDA definition of milk, cheese or other products made with milk and opposes the use of the word ""milk"" to designate any product not derived from mammals,"" Darin Von Ruden, President of the Wisconsin Farmers Union.  “National Farmers Union supports policy that encourages the healthy consumption of real dairy products and prevents the mislabeling of imitation and substitute dairy products in the marketplace. We appreciate Senator Baldwin’s leadership on the DAIRY PRIDE Act and her commitment to our nation’s dairy producers,” said Roger Johnson, President of the National Farmers Union.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, dairy imitators do not naturally provide the same level of nutrition as milk does,” said Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “We look forward to working with Senator Baldwin on this important legislation.”  “Cooperative Network strongly supports efforts to protect the integrity of dairy products by requiring national enforcement of the sensible labeling requirements we already have on the books. When misbranded items are corrected, we believe consumers will choose real dairy products over imitations, which will benefit Wisconsin’s vital $43 billion dollar dairy industry,” said Tom Liebe, President and CEO of the Cooperative Network.  “We applaud the efforts of Senator Baldwin to ensure that non-dairy foods are not inaccurately labeled as milk, cheese or yogurt. Our dairy farmers and processors work hard to produce incredible food. Milk and other real dairy products offer an almost unbeatable level and variety of nutrition. Mislabeling non-dairy foods confuses people buying these products and misleads them about the nutritional value of the items they purchase. It also hurts dairy farmers and related businesses. This bill is simply asking the FDA to adequately enforce the laws already on the books. It’s a small step that could have a very big positive impact,” said John Holevoet, Director of Government Affairs, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act is also supported by Bongards Creameries, Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery, First District Association, Dairy Business Association, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative, FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative, Mid-west Dairymen's Company and Scenic Central Milk Producers.  Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations define dairy products as being from dairy animals. Although existing federal regulation are clear, the FDA has not enforced these labeling regulations and the mislabeling of products as ‘milk’, ‘yogurt’ and ‘cheese’ has increased rapidly. This hurts dairy farmers that work tirelessly to ensure their Made in Wisconsin dairy products meet FDA standards and provide the public with nutritious food. It has also led to the proliferation of mislabeled alternative products that contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act would require the FDA to issue guidance for nationwide enforcement of mislabeled imitation dairy products within 90 days and require the FDA to report to Congress two years after enactment to hold the agency accountable for this update in their enforcement obligations.

673f05fa,Danny O'Connor has more than 10 times Troy Balderson's money going into November rematch,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - After narrowly winning an Aug. 7 special election for a Columbus-area congressional seat, newly minted GOP Rep. Troy Balderson of Zanesville is badly losing the fundraising battle in his November rematch with Democratic Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor, Federal Election Commission filings show.  Reports that covered the pair's campaign fundraising from July 19 through Aug. 27 showed O'Connor had more than $1 million in the bank at the end of August, compared with under $93,000 for Balderson.  O'Connor took in almost $4 million during the period covered by the report, including more than $1.4 million he got after losing the election by 1,680 votes. Balderson raised slightly more than $500,000. Roughly $180,000 of the cash Balderson raised came from political action committees.  O'Connor's campaign said he got donations from more than 92,000 people in the period covered by the report, most of whom gave small amounts of money. Most donors listed in his report were from outside of Ohio.  ""We have thousands of people chipping in $5 and $10 at a time,"" said O'Connor's campaign manager Annie  Ellison  . ""They are excited about Danny's campaign for new leadership. And we are really proud of that.""  Balderson's campaign had a different take on O'Connor's haul.  ""Liberal out of state special interest groups are continuing to prop up Danny O'Connor's campaign in their efforts to retake the House and put Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker's chair,"" said a statement Balderson released through his campaign before his own report was filed. ""While O'Connor's campaign has raised 90% of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters, our campaign is funded by hard-working Ohioans who want someone who will fight for them and their middle class values.""  O'Connor's campaign got more than $114,000 from political action committees, including $5,000 each from organizations associated with autoworkers, boilermakers and firefighters unions. He also got a $5,000 donation from a committee associated with New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and $2,000 from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign committee.  The political committees that contributed to Balderson included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which gave $2,000, and political committees associated with aspiring House of Representatives speakers Kevin McCarthy of California, who gave $4,000, and Jim Jordan of Champaign County, who gave $2,000. Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's political committee gave $5,000 to Balderson, as did political action committees for Koch Industries, Murray Energy, and Cardinal Health.  O'Connor's campaign said Balderson's report demonstrated he's ""beholden"" to corporations and party bosses.  ""We're proud of the grassroots support behind Danny's campaign for new leadership because people are ready for someone who isn't beholden to any corporation or party boss, that's why he didn't take a single dime of corporate PAC money and 92% of contributions were for $50 or less,"" Ellison said. ""Central Ohioans get excited for new leadership when they hear from Danny, and with this grassroots army we'll have the resources to communicate his message.""  O'Connor's biggest expenses were more than $2.6.million spent on media production and buys, and digital services. He felt financially secure enough to give a $25,000 contribution to the Ohio Democratic Party on Aug. 10.  Balderson's campaign spent more than $400,000 on media buys and more than $42,000 on fundraising services. He also paid the Republican National Committee $25,000 for a campaign event.  Records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that outside groups spent more than $5 million so far to back Balderson and oppose O'Connor, while groups sympathetic to O'Connor have spent around $1.3 million.  ""My record of balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and delivering results are what Ohioans are looking for in a Congressman, as evidenced by my victory in the August special election,"" said a statement from Balderson. ""We will have the necessary resources to deliver that message and defend against any attacks from the O'Connor-Pelosi team.""",partially false
e2e93a55,Pro-Life Groups Upset UN Coronavirus Relief Funds Can Promote Abortions in Ecuador,"The United Nations is using coronavirus aid to fund abortions in Ecuador, pro-life leaders in the country claim.  The Catholic News Agency reports the country’s Ministry of Foreign Relations and Human Mobility recently asked for $46.4 million in aid from the UN Humanitarian Response Plan COVID-19.  Within that UN funding package, however, is a goal to “maintain continuity of maternal, neonatal and children’s health and other sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic,” including abortions, according to the report.  “[Our] fear is that our highest authority in Ecuador will even consider accepting this economic shakedown of $46 million in exchange for the lives of thousands of unborn children,” Martha Villafuerte of the pro-life Guayaquil Family Network told ACI Prensa.  The Guayaquil Family Network and other pro-life organizations recently began a petition urging President Lenin Moreno to reject the abortion agenda within the aid, according to the report.  “It goes against the Constitution, specifically article 45, which guarantees the right to life from conception, a right that was ratified last September 17 at the plenary session of the National Assembly,” Villafuerte said.  HELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation!  Villafuerte said the UN plan would give Ecuador $46.4 million, but $3 million of that aid would be used to train “health personnel on safe, legal abortion and post-abortion care.”  Some lawmakers are speaking out against the abortion agenda, too.  “Unbelievable! The UN conditions ‘safe legal abortion’ in its humanitarian support plan for Ecuador,” Assemblyman Héctor Yépez wrote on Twitter. “While we all want to save lives, some insist on eliminating the lives of unborn girls and boys.”  UPDATE 5/26/20: The Ecuadorian government has assured Yépez that funds would not be used to legalize abortions and would only be spent in accordance with current laws.  In statements to ACI Prensa, legislator Yépez referred to the Foreign Ministry’s response. “The objective of preventing them from executing what the UN wanted, which was an attempt to advance abortion, was achieved, but now they come out with a pun to wash their faces, in which they say that they were only referring to what it was already established in the Comprehensive Organic Penal Code ”. “I think the objective has been met, having discovered the intent, and with this letter they themselves are ensuring that they are not going to execute anything outside of what the law says in Ecuador, which is what we were looking for,” he stressed. However, Yépez urged “to remain very vigilant so that the COVID-19 Humanitarian Response Plan is not distorted.”  The United Nations has faced prior international criticism for pushing abortions as part of its response to the coronavirus.  Jonathan Abbamonte of the Population Research Institute wrote more about it earlier this month:  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has also been urging governments to ensure uninterrupted access to abortion during the pandemic. An interim technical brief recently issued by UNFPA calls on governments to: “Ensure women’s and girls’ choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health is respected regardless of their COVID-19 status, including access to contraception, emergency contraception, safe abortion to the full extent of the law.” The technical brief also advises governments to “encourage” women who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection to seek abortion services “to the full extent of the law.” This seems a backhanded way of saying that, when women come to African health clinics to be treated for the coronavirus, they should also be propagandized about the benefits of abortion. Health care in Africa has often been directly tied to population control programs in this way.  The WHO also faced heavy criticism from pro-life leaders this spring when it falsely claimed abortion is an essential service during the coronavirus pandemic.  President Donald Trump stopped giving United States tax dollars to the United Nations Population Fund in 2017, and, in April, he halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO).

ae596f59,CBC Cuts Donald Trump's 'Home Alone 2' Cameo Out of Broadcast,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is full of violence that, in my opinion, exceeds the physical comedy of the original film and is borderline barbarism. The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That’s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump’s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.  You guys are the biggest bush league “journalists” of all time. Editing out Trump’s cameo in Home Alone 2.

The first time the CBC’s cutting of Trump’s cameo appearance was acknowledged on Twitter was around Christmas that year:  Thanks @CBC for cutting @realDonaldTrump out of Home Alone 2. — Colt McCaullany🇨🇦 (@DENNISGRIMBLE) December 22, 2015  Now, either 2015 happened to be the first year the CBC broadcasted the movie, which I highly doubt, or something happened between the 2014 CBC broadcast of Home Alone 2, and the 2015 CBC broadcast. One could argue that Trump wasn’t a political figure in the public’s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama’s birth certificate—so I don’t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I’m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump’s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can’t decide if this is hilarious or sad.  Update January 2: Just to be clear, the CBC issued a formal statement saying Home Alone 2 was edited in 2014 when they first obtained the rights to the movie.  _____  Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama’s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

610801c6,New research of toxic bait might provide control of wild hog problem in Texas and other states,"The rapid and uncontrolled population growth of feral swine in Texas and other affected states has been a severe problem for at least the last decade, damages caused by the wild animals reaching into the millions just in Texas.  Nationally, feral swine cause major damage to property, agriculture (crops and livestock), native species and ecosystems, and cultural and historic resources. This invasive species costs the United States an estimated $1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs.  Related: No end in sight for Texas' war against feral swine  In addition to these concerns, because of their very nature, feral swine, which wallow along river banks, lakes and ponds, are known to spread diseases to other types of wildlife, and domestic animals. Feral pigs are also becoming a problem in some suburban areas as they root up turf at homes, parks and golf courses. They also turn over and root through trash cans in suburban areas and pose a driving hazard when moving in large numbers near roadways and highways.  In recent years a major effort to control population numbers has helped, but wildlife and public health officials say more needs to be done. But with an estimated five million feral swine running free in the United States, controlling the problem appears to be greater than current efforts to manage their numbers.  Limited Control Options  Existing control methods include hunting and trapping the animals, but in spite of eliminating a considerable number of the animals, feral swine continue to spread into other states not previously known to be feeding or breeding grounds. Overall, 39 states have reported some level of problem with wild pigs.  Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA. More effort to reduce their numbers has occurred in Texas than anywhere else, representing more traps, more hunts, and more research. Yet their numbers are growing, and so is the amount of damage they cause each year.  In 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveiled a wide-reaching plan to deal with the feral hog problem, calling for what he termed a ""hog-apocalypse"" involving the distribution of a deadly poison bait. Miller initially approved the legal use of a commercial poison that contained warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. Once feral swine ingest the poison, they begin to bleed internally. But hunters and conservationists expressed concern, fearing other animals may be exposed to the toxin, possibly affecting any animal or human predator feeding on the meat of a poisoned pig.  Shortly after announcing its use, the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily removed the product from the market out of fear of lawsuits and other possible retribution.  Toxic Bait Evaluation  Now, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is evaluating another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine. APHIS received an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trials on free-roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November, and signed a final environmental assessment and issued a Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) associated with conducting field trials using the poison.  ""Wildlife Services takes the selection and use of toxic baits for use in wildlife damage management very seriously. The final environmental assessments, FONSI and EUP, are the result of years of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private, state, federal and international partners,"" reports APHIS Wildlife Services (WS) Deputy Administrator Bill Clay. ""With these in place, we can now begin field trials to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for removing feral swine sounders in natural settings, as well as any potential impacts to non-target wildlife.""  Safeguards  Clay says the EUP allows researchers to partner with landowners to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounders (herds) each in Texas and Alabama. He said bait delivery systems designed to prevent access by non-target wildlife will be filled with placebo bait, placed in the sounders’ territories and monitored with motion-activated cameras.  Following a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting areas, the placebo bait will be replaced with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two nights. As a research method, at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoons in each state’s study area are to be captured live and radio-collared prior to baiting in order to monitor their movements and exposure to the bait. Landowners within 300 meters of bait stations will be notified, and signs will be placed on bait stations and along roads leading into the study areas.  ""Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) is a meat preservative commonly used to cure meats such as sausage and bacon. When eaten in high doses over a short period of time, it is toxic to feral swine. The mode of death is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. Once enough sodium nitrite bait is eaten, the feral swine gets faint, is rendered unconscious, and quickly dies. In most cases, feral swine die within two and-a-half to three hours after eating a lethal dose,"" Clay said.  Researchers say many factors are considered when developing a toxic bait for feral swine. Not only must it be effective and humane in eliminating feral swine, but also must be low risk for those handling it, the environment, and wildlife. Other wildlife, such as raccoons, bears and deer, may be attracted to the sodium nitrite toxic bait, but to prevent non-target species from accessing it, researchers will use delivery systems and baiting strategies designed to target feral swine. Trials will not be conducted in areas with known black bear populations.  The trials are scheduled to begin in both Alabama and Texas as early as February.  ""Although trapping, aerial operations, and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduced damage in some areas, studies show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be removed each year in order to prevent population growth,"" Clay said. ""Should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine, it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrated feral swine damage management.""  Skeptics  While farmers welcome technology that helps to control the damaging swine in their fields, there are skeptics.  Roland Ortiz, a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area, says wild hogs are ""very intelligent creatures,"" and they are prolific breeders. Ortiz stays busy hunting and trapping hogs on farms, ranches and lately in subdivisions that contract his services.  ""We are slowly pushing back into more sparsely populated areas, but they keep coming back. Managing them is a full time job, ""Ortiz said.  While he agrees a toxic bait would help to control wild swine populations, he doubts anything will ever solve the problem.  ""We have rat poison, but there's still lots of rats,"" Ortiz notes.",partially false

Watch below (timestamp 2:35) –  Partial transcript:  “…The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people.

And doing that so you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.  “So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges – you know pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard, and that actual decision of ‘okay, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world,’ governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”",FALSE

Having confidence in our elections means knowing that votes are legally cast and that voters themselves are legally eligible to cast a ballot.  Americans cannot have confidence in election results unless elected officials, law enforcement authorities, and fair-minded journalists take the issue of voter fraud seriously and investigate potential instances thoroughly. The Trump campaign will continue to bring these allegations to light, and the media and election authorities should vigorously examine them.  Here are several examples in Georgia that should be investigated:  Voter records show someone used the identity of Mrs. Deborah Jean Christiansen of Roswell, Georgia to vote in the recent election, even though Mrs. Christiansen passed away in May 2019. Further, someone registered Christiansen to vote on October 5, the day of the deadline to register, more than a year after she passed away. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran an obituary announcing Christiansen’s death at the time of her passing.  Someone used the identity of James Blalock of Covington, Georgia to cast a ballot in last week’s election, even though Blalock died in 2006. Blalock’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution shortly after he passed away that year.  Linda Kesler of Nicholson, Georgia died in 2003, but someone cast a ballot under her identity in last week’s election. Nicholson’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution when she passed away.  Edward Skwiot of Trenton, Georgia is shown as having cast a ballot last week, even though he died in 2015. The Chattanooga Times Free Press ran a death notice in April of that year.

a14a969b,Cynthia Nixon slams Cuomo on Albany's culture of corruption,"ALBANY – Gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon said the state’s economic development programs overseen by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo need an overhaul, which she said will become especially evident this summer during the corruption trial into the awarding of the Buffalo Billion and other upstate projects. “I think it’s going to be incredibly damaging"" for Cuomo, Nixon said in an interview with The Buffalo News about the political impact of the pay-to-play trial of several Buffalo and Syracuse executives and the recent conviction of a former trusted adviser of Cuomo. “In the corruption Olympics that is Albany, I think Andrew Cuomo is winning himself some gold medals,"" said the actress and political activist who on Monday announced her Democratic primary run against Cuomo. In a 16-minute interview, her first with a daily news outlet since her campaign started, Nixon kept up her barrage of assaults on Cuomo and sought to lay out a path for her candidacy. Though focused in the early days on New York City, Nixon said she expects to begin an upstate campaign either next week or the following week. Nixon, 51, best known as one of the stars of the ""Sex and the City"" television series and movies, is making her first run for elected office. She said one of the reasons she is running is “because of Andrew Cuomo’s enormous tax breaks” that she said have benefited wealthy people and corporations. Asked for her view of a major tax break Cuomo has championed for the film and television industry, Nixon said she is studying the issue. But, she quickly added, “I don’t think there’s any real truth that that enormous expenditure of money is making a significant enough different in production to justify it.’’ She added that the more than $420 million annual tax break the industry receives “doesn’t merit the investment” the state is giving in tax credits. She said the beneficiaries are predominately large entertainment companies. Nixon, who has been involved in public school funding activism for 16 years, slammed Cuomo for not providing enough state aid to the Buffalo city schools. She estimated Buffalo schools would be owed more than $100 million in aid from the state, had Albany followed the decision that came out of a landmark school funding lawsuit won by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a group Nixon got involved with when her oldest teenager began as a kindergarten student in a New York City public school. Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon launches run against Cuomo But Nixon saved much of her attacks on Cuomo over the component of the Buffalo Billion program that is going to be front and center in a federal courtroom later this summer. “If you look at (Cuomo’s) attempt at economic development, there’s just been enormous giveaways with not a lot to show for it. Buffalo Billion is a prime example of the intersection of corruption and pay to play, giving state business to his donors without a lot of oversight, without a lot of strings attached,"" Nixon said. “The thing that’s so awful about the Buffalo Billion is the corruption, of course … but also how much money is being spent with so little accountability. The corruption is one thing, but these are just a bad investment of taxpayer dollars,"" she said. Nixon added that “it was good that jobs were created” in the broader Buffalo Billion program, but she questioned the way in which economic development dollars are dedicated by the Cuomo administration and said more state money needs to be spent on crumbling infrastructure needs. “We need an overall, real investment in our infrastructure,"" she said. The looming Buffalo Billion trial in June is partly over alleged pay-to-play bribery allegations involving the state’s more than $750 million contract to build the solar manufacturing plant at Buffalo’s RiverBend. Cuomo has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing by federal prosecutors.",TRUE

The Senate Republicans’ plan includes proposals that prioritize restarting our local economies, rethinking how New York State operates, and renewing a commitment to New York State’s residents to ensure strong, robust communities.  Restart our Local Economies by:  · Safely reopening our small businesses to help them get back on their feet and offer gainful employment for residents;  · Helping our schools and colleges stay open; and  · Investing in our physical and human infrastructure to rebuild our state’s competitiveness.  Rethink how New York State Operates by:  · Ending New York State’s unaffordability problem, which has been made worse by the pandemic;  · Taking on State government’s culture of overspending and restoring fiscal responsibility; and  · Reasserting the Legislature’s constitutional authority as an equal branch of government.  Renew our Commitment to Residents by:  · Fostering the growth of vibrant local communities;  · Developing a robust economy with diverse opportunities; and  · Creating safer neighborhoods with common sense public safety measures.  “New York government is failing its people. Broken policies have made New York more expensive, less safe and have diminished the quality of life for our residents. We need to change course before it is too late,” said Deputy Leader Andrew Lanza.  “Throughout this pandemic, there seems to have been little interest from New York’s one-party leadership in stepping up and taking an active legislative role in constructively combating the pandemic by putting our communities’ safety and livelihoods at the forefront of legislative policy. I’m proud to join my colleagues in offering actual solutions to help us rise to meet the challenges ahead. I call on my colleagues across the political spectrum to join us as we work toward ending this terrible crisis and rebuilding our state for the better,” said Senator Fred Akshar.  “While New York State once stood tall in our nation as a pillar of economic strength, educational excellence and public policy innovation, its leadership today is more dubious. High taxes, excessive, job-killing regulations, and a rising crime rate have made us number one in population loss, and a misguided focus on politically driven agendas has diverted precious resources away from our core responsibilities. With the added challenges created by the pandemic, the future of our state hangs in the balance. If there was ever a compelling case to rethink and change course, this is it,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Long before the COVID-19 pandemic turned our world upside down, New York faced daunting challenges, including a looming budget deficit and a shrinking population. The corona virus has exacerbated our problems, adding to the financial burden we face and bringing our economy and many small businesses to the brink. As we fight the pandemic, we must also safely re-open our economy, control spending, ease the burden on taxpayers and restore our system of checks and balances in state government,” said Senator Patrick M. Gallivan.  “We have seen an exodus of New York residents, families and businesses who have fled the state for better opportunities elsewhere because of unwelcome policies, burdensome regulations and high taxes. Substantive and dramatic change is needed, especially at a time when the state’s fiscal challenges have been significantly exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. This plan refocuses the state’s priorities and helps to build a better and brighter future for New York,” said Senator Joseph Griffo.  “Together we can restore New York to its rightful status as the Empire State. To accomplish this we must work with our small business owners, farmers and other job creators. My focus is on getting New York open for business and helping people get back to work safely. This common sense package would help the communities I represent and put our state on the road to real economic recovery and future prosperity,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “Overcoming the unprecedented, ongoing health, economic, and community challenges posed by COVID-19 requires big, bold solutions. We need to rethink the state’s approach to solving problems, successfully restart our economy, and renew our commitment to residents and each other. Partisan politics and a bureaucratic Albany trapped in the old ways of doing things won’t work. What will work is advancing smarter public policies that recognize the breadth and depth of our challenges and the necessity of fresh thinking that goes beyond party labels. It’s time for our state to hit the reset button, and it begins with the priorities and principles we are unveiling today. Our Reset New York State plan reflects our continued efforts to bring New Yorkers together and improve the quality of life across our state. We are ready to answer the challenges of COVID and deliver the positive change New Yorkers expect and rightfully deserve,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “Between July 2019 and July 2020, New York State led the nation in at least one thing- people moving out. The pandemic only accelerated a trend that was already in place. High taxes and an unfriendly business climate are the real culprits. Our small businesses need help and our state needs a new direction. We already know what works from other states that are growing and not shrinking. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, instead we need a reset. Senate Republicans have a plan to do just that and I'm proud to support it,” said Senator Michael Martucci.  “As our state begins to emerge from the current crisis, it is vital that we start immediately working together to make our state’s future brighter than the past. The ‘Reset New York’ plan reflects the priorities of hardworking New Yorkers and I am proud to join with my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference to make sure their voices are heard in Albany. The challenges our state faces are not new but the solutions must be – and finding them must be our main focus,” said Senator Mario Mattera.  “I look forward throughout this new legislative session to our Senate Republican Conference giving voice to the need for rebuilding local economies, focusing on stronger and safer communities, and resisting what threatens to be a devastating expansion of a business-as-usual, tax-and-spend direction in state government. This ‘Reset New York’ strategy begins our commitment to more fiscally responsible, commonsense government that works better for taxpayers, builds and protects livelihoods, honors public safety and security, and focuses like never before on the restoration of Upstate’s rightful place in New York government,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “New York is facing true challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic is one reason for our struggles, but wayward state policies that fail to meet the needs of our small businesses, families, and taxpayers, are the real culprit. There is no margin for error and the time is now to change course by enacting the Reset New York agenda. Specifically, broadband access, support for our farmers, and a strong educational system are among the initial building blocks that can set us on the right path. Let’s enact policies that create opportunities, not those that confine us,” said Senator Peter Oberacker.  “Long Island’s families, businesses and seniors are hurting and need greater support and relief from state government, both in the immediate term to help get through the pandemic and in the future to ensure that New York is a more affordable and safer place to call home. Reset New York will put us on a trajectory to accomplish these goals and begin to reverse the trends of higher taxes, burdensome regulations, and more crime that has caused hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the Empire State,” said Senator Anthony Palumbo.  “New York is in desperate need of a reset. The pandemic has highlighted and exasperated the issues that our state has faced for decades. We continue to lose residents and jobs, with our high taxes and over regulations. Our communities are suffering. Small businesses, restaurants and family farms are struggling to stay afloat. We need to provide real answers and solutions to help our local economies and save our struggling communities. We can no longer ignore these glaring issues. New Yorkers need results now,” said Senator Ed Rath.  “In recent years, people have been fleeing New York State due to high taxes, a lack of opportunity, and red tape that hinders business growth. The pandemic has only made matters worse and now, more than ever, our state needs a reset. From reenergizing our small businesses to making New York more affordable for hardworking taxpayers, my colleagues and I are committed to fighting for changes that will improve our state in the wake of this unprecedented pandemic,” said Senator Patty Ritchie.  “Despite the unprecedented challenges that our communities are facing, New Yorkers have remained resilient, and now more than ever, they need a government determined to deliver results. If we want to rebuild our state, we have to start by resetting the state's priorities and ensuring that the needs of hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers are firmly at the top. I am proud to join with my colleagues to reaffirm our commitment to that goal and to do all that we can to ensure that small businesses, middle class families, and struggling New Yorkers have a strong, independent voice on their side,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “There’s only one way forward and that’s to enable our businesses and communities, big and small, to have the best possible chance to recover. When the need for help is apparent, too often the response of government is to throw an anvil instead of a life-preserver into the water. We can’t make this harder with higher taxes and more unreasonable demands. Our vision must show that we are listening. That’s what this is about,” said Senator Dan Stec.  “As we begin a New Year and new legislative session, our top priority must continue to be addressing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic so we can stop the spread of the virus, save lives and safely reopen our economy. In order to reset New York State by safely restarting our economy, we need to address the elephant in the room that our state government is not talking about: the fact that for the third year in a row, New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade. When enough people who can afford to leave New York State are gone, who will be left to pay for the infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities? I look forward to joining with Leader Ortt and my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference in the coming weeks and months to address these issues and put forth policies to turn things around so the Empire State does not become the ‘Empty State,’” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “I look forward to joining my Senate Republican Conference colleagues in advancing our ambitious Reset New York plan today. As we all work toward opening our State and local communities safely from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus must be on the economy, which starts with advancing policies that support small businesses, which are the backbones of our communities, jobs, public safety, improving our local infrastructure, and ensuring our schools get their fair share. One party control has pushed those priorities to the side and with our Reset New York plan, our Conference will ensure that the voices of our constituents are heard,” said Senator Alexis Weik.  ###",partially false
c3dea290,BREAKING: US Military at the White House Arresting Congress,"Special Operations (SOF) units including 4,000 deputized National Guard soldiers acting as US Marshalls, have served indictments on, or were about to arrest 67% of Congress. Early Mon. morning 25 Jan.  between 3 and 6 am Military vans, buses and police cars, along with a multitude of police and Military troops, were very busy at a blacked out White House.  “I just watched everyone in the White House arrested” declared an unnamed person doing one of the two videos shown below. (Video contains graphic language) https://youtu.be/ywfXNGNvvuU      Even though the Mass Media have refused to report it, the US has been functioning under Martial Law since Sat. 9 Jan. An Interim Military US Government was actually running the US and they saw President Biden as a treasonous agent. A few days before Joe Biden’s Inauguration and due to foreign interference in the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump had instigated the Insurgency Act, declared Martial Law and deferred his power to the US Military.  Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House. According to two separate videos taped at the scene, police and US troops were everywhere in the darkness. Military vans, buses and police cars pulled up to the White House, loaded passengers, took them down the road and across a bridge and then some vans came back empty to do a repeat.  Mustang Medic’s recording showed many buses and vans, some marked as Military, entering the Capitol grounds. Several people were taped getting out of their cars, showing IDs to guards and then walking into the grounds.      https://rumble.com/vdawtd-mass-arrest-at-the-capitol.html  When it was over and seemingly on Q, fireworks lit up the sky. Reports from those on the ground claimed that by later that day the White House was closed up tight and remained so as of right now.  https://youtu.be/iqjVRcSejWU  Evidently Biden’s team was not in the White House, but detained and arrested behind the scenes. The US Military was expected to have arrested Harris on charges of treason, while invoking the 25th Amendment on Biden because of his dementia and subsequent inability to hold office. (The Deep State had plans to invoke the 25th on Biden, put Harris in his place and Pelosi as VP. Not going to happen).  On Fri. 22 Jan. a Juan O Savin reported that the US Interim Military Government was about to arrest Joe Biden and his traitor Deep State politicians in DC. Crimes of these elite politicians have recently been exposed from findings of the Russia hoax Mueller probe, impeachments of Trump and Obamagate.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT57EP1wL9g&feature=share      It was reported that to date, 260 global elites have been served, “The deal that they got was that if they gave information that was useful, they could have a better death, or a jail cell for life.

Communications would be cut off for a short period of time. There’s some mayors, governors and judges out there with their names on some of the over 222, 286 sealed indictments filed in federal courts across the nation since Trump took office in 2016.  On Tues. 26 Jan from about 11am EST to about 4pm EST there were massive internet and network outages on the East Coast said to be a cover for Special Operations (SOF) units making arrests of Deep State bad guys.  https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/tech/verizon-fios-outage/index.html  Soon the Emergency Broadcast System would be activated to announce all.

3b246b55,This New Bill Would Allow Texas Teachers To Kill Their Students If They Felt It Was Needed,"Texas state Rep. Dan Flynn(R) has proposed a bill called the Teacher’s Protection Act (H.B.868). It would allow teachers to use deadly force on school property, a school bus, or at an event sponsored by a school either in self-defense or defense of students at the school. Teachers would also be allowed to use guns while defending school property. In addition, teachers who shot someone under such circumstances would be granted “civil immunity,” which means they could not be held liable if the student they shot was injured or killed. Teachers in Texas already have the right to keep guns in the classroom.  Flynn is a strong supporter of gun rights. He has worked on pieces of legislation that permitted people to have guns on college campuses and that reduced the required minimum number of hours of training for a concealed handgun license.  Gun advocates have been demanding that teachers be armed ever since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 that resulted in 20 fatalities. Gun control advocates, however, state that easy access to guns increases crime. Psychologists also note that easy access to guns increases the chance of somebody getting shot during an emotionally charged confrontation.  Civil rights organizations also oppose the bill. They point out that black and Latino students are already more likely to be disciplined harshly at school than are their white classmates. They are more likely to be suspended or expelled. Civil rights activists worry that since students of color are already being targeted for their behavior by school authorities, they would be more likely to be the victims of gun-wielding teachers than their white peers.

da01ca66,Current Actual Election Result Update: President Trump Leading In Electoral College With More Paths to Victory Than Biden,"Based on actual results and accounting for states currently not called, still counting, recounting, under investigation or audit, or states with election issues now in the courts, President Trump is winning the 2020 Presidential Election.  Per consideration for all the states still in question, President Trump is currently winning the 2020 election.  Here is what we already know. A number of states have been called but a number are still in question. Here is a list of those in question.  Pennsylvania – although the current counts show Biden leading there is so much corruption in this state that it is likely that this state will never come to a transparent and agreed upon decision on who wins this state. President Trump was up by 700,000 votes on election night but more than a million ballots were added since that which eventually stole the election for Biden. The President has a clear path to victory once the illegal votes are addressed.  TRENDING: FBI Sends Out Warning Advising Against Buying, Making or Misrepresenting a Vaccine Card Which May Be ""Breaking the Law""  Wisconsin – this state as well now shows Biden in the lead but early in the morning after the election more than 100,000 votes magically appeared in Milwaukee. The current lead for Biden is only 20,000. If these votes or the exception in the numbers in Rock County are addressed, Trump will likely win this state by a large margin.  Michigan – this state is as well full of fraud. Lawsuits are in place. In addition there were over 100,000 votes dumped in Detroit and the lead here was stolen from Trump as well. Once the illegal votes are eliminated President Trump has a very good chance of winning this state as well.  Georgia – this state too has much fraud. The President was winning this state on election night by 100,000 votes. But after the election a program was put in place to basically harvest a number of ballots. Now Biden leads in this state as well. Once the harvested ballots are thrown out, this state will go to Trump as well.  Nevada – there is much fraud here as well. Signatures were not verified on hundreds of thousands of votes. It is likely that President Trump will win this state if any of the ineligible votes are eliminated here as well.

Alaska – this still hasn’t been called but it is clearly a red state and should have been called on Election night. No doubt more monkey business going on here as well.

465eaa43,4 challenges await Panetta at DOD,"One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword, says the author. | AP photo 4 challenges await Panetta at DOD  Defense Secretary-designate Leon Panetta gained vast government experience as a reform-minded member of the House, where he chaired the Budget Committee. He later served in the White House as President Bill Clinton’s director of the Office of Management and Budget and then chief of staff. He aimed to put America’s financial accounts on a path to balance by the year 2000. He succeeded.  His integrity, lawyerly leadership, razor-sharp mind and affable demeanor will serve our nation, President Barack Obama and the Defense Department well.  Four major challenges await him at DoD:  • Address the wear and tear protracted warfare has exacted on our armed forces  The longest military engagements in U.S. history have achieved exemplary results at significant human cost. Multiple deployments, 5,885 deaths, thousands of permanent disabilities, inadequate dwell time, broken families, historic levels of suicide by soldiers and even family members and more than $2 trillion in treasure — all demand that our nation set firm timetables to complete the military mission and turn operations over to civilian control.  U.S. soldiers should not be expected to do nation-building. Ensuring success halfway around the world requires robust engagement of the world community — starting with neighboring nations whose backyards adjoin the undemocratic societies in which our soldiers bear the burden of order.  One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword. People in those societies should aspire to a better future for themselves — and be willing to sacrifice for it.  • Balance security concerns with budget realities    The need to cut war-induced federal deficits, both in the short term and long term, means that all spending must be on the table — including defense. It now makes up 20 percent of annual federal spending. Military leaders under Panetta must be resourceful, efficient and visionary to save dollars, while keeping our commitment to the troops and without compromising our national security.  The killing of Osama bin Laden is likely to further disrupt the capacity of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, allowing the U.S. to continue to withdraw forces from Iraq and begin an orderly drawdown from Afghanistan. Even so, the U.S. must maintain, as the Obama administration has pledged, a strong and agile military that is well trained and well equipped.  The new secretary recognizes the importance of hard power and soft power and understands that America must not only be militarily strong, but financially sound.  • Reining in the contractors    The increase in the use of contractors demands special scrutiny at the highest levels for three reasons:  a. Morale in the ranks  Insourcing military functions back to DoD is necessary — not just for prudent management of taxpayer dollars but morale in the ranks. When an E5 guard pilot, who enlisted at basic pay, sees contractors earning five times as much and operating by different rules of the road, there is a serious breakdown in the value set of service. Indeed the very meaning of military service changes from “duty” to “job.” Long term, this will corrupt the military code of honor and needs to be reined in now.  b. Security  Significant outsourcing of Pentagon duties to contractors increases the likelihood of security breaches. The military is aware this has even occurred in theater.  I can recall my shock at seeing signs posted in Iraq’s Green Zone: “No Alcohol on Base.” These were meant to curb contractor abuse. But what a poor message this sends to our regular forces. Military service should be exactly that – service to our nation, not one’s wallet.  c. Cost savings  Defense Secretary Robert Gates has left a goal of reducing service-support contractors by 10 percent each year for three years. Yet the FY 2012 budget seems to contradict this goal — since it contains funding to support growing contracted services. DoD proposes spending at least $87.6 billion next year on contracted services — $23.7 billion more than requested in FY 2011 and a 38 percent increase!  This increase in contractor spending flies in the face of a congressionally mandated inventory of contractors that the department has been derelict in providing. Hopefully, this is a lapse that Panetta can rectify early in his tenure.  Regaining U.S. energy independence  The Pentagon, as the largest petroleum user in the world, must lead our nation forward to energy independence. No challenge could be more vital to national security and economic security interests. High fuel costs are causing a hardship on American families, to be sure — but also on our service branches.  Even before the oil companies and Wall Street speculators drove up the price of gasoline close to $4 a gallon, the landed cost of a gallon delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400.  The Marines, the Navy and Navy Secretary Ray Mabus have been pacesetters among the service branches in developing alternatives to petroleum. Mabus told our subcommittee earlier this year, “Energy consumption in the Navy and Marine Corps has become a strategic vulnerability, an operational Achilles’ heel and a readiness challenge.”  The Navy and Marine Corps have set the goal to generate at least 50 percent of all the energy they use come from alternative sources no later than 2020. This is leadership. Panetta would be well served to expand this vision department-wide. Regaining U.S. energy independence is the national security issue of our time.  I look forward to working with Mr. Panetta and our subcommittee as we work together to put the Defense Department on a sustainable path to meet our nation’s vital needs in the 21st century.  Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) is on the Budget and Defense subcommittees of the House Appropriations Committee.",TRUE
8cf3a230,Rep. David McKinley Calls for Increase in Border Patrol Agent Ranks,"WHEELING — At least $53 million a week in illegal drugs cross the Mexican border into the U.S. each week, and more border agents are needed at the U.S.-Mexican border to stop this, according to U.S. Rep. David B. McKinley.  McKinley, R-W.Va., recently traveled to the U.S.-Mexican border to learn about the issue there first hand. He visited the McAllen, Texas region in the Rio Grande District of the U.S. Border Patrol.  He commended the work of the border agents.  “They put themselves in danger and try to keep the border clean and secure. They’ve done that for decades,” McKinley said. “What has compounded this is the humanitarian crisis. We didn’t always have so many people trying to cross illegally.”  The agents attempt to still do their security job, put many are being pulled off the line to take care of the humanitarian crisis.  While at the border, McKinley learned a Mexican drug cartel controls happenings at the border.  He spoke with immigrants detained at the border who told him they paid the cartel anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 to get them across the border. Often, part of the deal is that the immigrant carry illegal drugs with them on the journey.  If the immigrants are captured, they are sent back to their village and must start over again and seek help from the cartel, McKinley said.  “One of the border officers said they (the cartel) might be making as much money on this as they are on drugs,” he said.  Border guards have a lot of tools to help track immigrants crossing into the U.S., even if they don’t have the manpower to stop all of them, according to McKinley.  The entire U.S.-Mexico border is about 2,000 miles long, while the Rio Grande District agents focus on a specific 300-mile area. Sections of the Rio Grande River are narrow, and often the water is so low immigrants can walk across it. Border guards showed McKinley the footsteps in the mud where some had walked across the night before.  Where there isn’t a wall, cameras and sensors are placed to indicate when an immigrant is coming across the border.  But the cartel knows when agents could be as far as 10 miles away from a possible passage and unable to stop it. That’s when they help immigrants cross into the U.S., according to McKinley.  Nearly a million immigrants were stopped at the border before entering the U.S. last year, he said. Rio Grande District agents were responsible for 399,000 of the arrests, but they know from their technology they missed at least 47,000 immigrants in their crossing.  Many of these immigrants entering the U.S. carried opioids, according to McKinley.  “(Border agents) say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,” he said.  To compare, the state of West Virginia recently received $28 million for opioid rehabilitation, treatment and education.  “Almost twice that amount comes across the border each week — to put it into perspective,” McKinley said.",TRUE

31a6122b,"Gas prices have dropped, but in N.Y. state they're still pretty high","BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — As people stay home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, the price of gas has slowly started to drop.  But in New York State, that’s not saying much.  That’s because New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00, according to numbers provided by the AAA of Western and Central New York.  Nationally, the average price of a gallon of gas is $1.77, compared to $2.89 a year ago.  In New York State, it's $2.18 per gallon, compared to $2.96 a year ago.  In Buffalo, gas is now $2.23 per gallon, compared to $2.88 a year ago.  “The oil prices have a direct impact on what we pay at the pump, so with these low oil prices and this low demand for gasoline right now, we're just seeing gas prices drop,” said Elizabeth Carey, spokeswoman for the AAA.  Oil demand first started to drop in China, she said, and government directives for the coronavirus now have people stuck at home here.  “Gas has been coming down for nine straight weeks since this all began,” Carey said of the outbreak and traveling restrictions.  But some motorists wonder why Western New Yorkers are not seeing more of a break here in local gas prices.  One 7 Eyewitness News viewer wrote, ""The gas stations will up their prices the second gas goes up even though the gas in the tanks was purchased at a lower market value. Are we paying over a dollar in taxes in NYS or are they gouging?""  Another wrote, ""Why is gas on the reservation 97 cents? Add 46 cents taxes [and] why are we not paying $1.43 a [gallon] on regular gas stations? We [are] getting ripped off.""  “You have to consider the New York State taxes,” Carey said.  That's right: she said higher gas prices are just a reality for motorists living in the Empire State. New Yorkers pay $0.65 in taxes for every gallon of gas they buy, and more than $0.45 are state taxes.  “Compare that to Ohio,” she said. “They charge about half of that in their state taxes. So their prices are much lower.”  By the time New Yorkers head back to work, she said, prices will likely start creeping back up.  “[If] they start raising that work-from-home limit, yeah, prices are going to go up,” she said. “There'll be a higher demand, but it's hard to say how much.”",TRUE

43b52abb,"Software issue in Michigan gave Biden an estimated 6,000 Trump votes","Editor note and update: Since our original article was published, the Michigan secretary of state’s office has published a notice explaining that the Antrim county reporting mistake resulted from a user error, not a software error, and did not affect the election results or other counties or states.  —  ANTRIM COUNTY, MI -This is an update to an earlier report we filed about a computer “glitch” in Antrim County, Michigan which was reported to have only affected two Republican votes in the important swing state.  However, the Detroit Free Press is reporting it was much, much worse.  According to Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican who ran unopposed and won a third term on Tuesday in a very strong Republican county, results on electronic tapes and a computer card were apparently accurate, however when the results were transcribed from the cards to a computer, something appeared to be wrong.  In 2016, President Trump won the county with around 62% of the vote, compared to 33% for Hillary Clinton. The president outpolled Clinton by 4,000 votes.  Wednesday morning after the election, results in the county showed Biden leading the president by around 3,000 votes with 98% of precincts reporting. Nothing to see here, right?  Guy said that officials hadn’t checked the results prior to posting them, however later asked:  “How could Democrats take over this county?”  Clearly, that made zero sense.  She said that officials were going over the tape of the results and inputting the numbers manually.  Antrim uses Dominion voting equipment and doesn’t use cellular modems to transmit results from precincts to county offices. Rather, the data is transported by election officials, Guy said.  She originally noted she was in talks with the company that maintains the equipment but said it could be the result of “human error.”  Tom McMillin, a former state lawmaker from Oakland County told the Detroit Free Press that he is estimating that both President Trump and US Senate Candidate John James could realize between 4,000-5,000 votes each.  Joe Gumm, a local news anchor with KXXV-TV tweeted about Michigan’s use of the same Election Source program and noted that 33 other counties used that same possibly compromised program to compile their vote totals.  A political commentator, Dennis Lennox also questioned the vote totals from other counties in the state.  “Trump did not lose #AntrimCounty in #Michigan. It is now confirmed that 32 other counties use the same software as Antrim County. He will get 6,000 plus votes out of Antrim. What about the other counties with the same software?” he tweeted.  But according to AFP:  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office released a statement on November 7 explaining what went wrong in Antrim, and how it was corrected.  “The error in reporting unofficial results in Antrim County Michigan was the result of a user error that was quickly identified and corrected; did not affect the way ballots were actually tabulated; and would have been identified in the county canvass before official results were  reported even if it had not been identified earlier,” the statement said.  The software program, Election Source, worked properly and correctly counted votes, but the county missed an operation step, the statement said. This resulted in a miscommunication between the software and the county’s central election management system that was quickly corrected.  “This was an isolated error, there is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state, and if it did it would be caught during county canvasses, which are conducted by bipartisan boards of county canvassers.”  Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy is quoted on the county’s Facebook page: “We continue to work hard to ensure the integrity of the election results.”  It will be interesting to see if the 138,339 vote dump that went to Biden under the cover of darkness early Wednesday morning , with The Federalist noting that “Biden somehow got all of the votes, and Trump got none, zero, in an overnight vote-dump.”  An apparent “issue” with an election ballot counting program caused only two votes to be tallied for Republican candidates. The problem is being blamed on programming “infrastructure” and could be prevalent through other counties across the state of Michigan.  Two major races are impacted by this “issue”: President, with Joe Biden now leading Donald Trump in the state; and United States Senate, with John James losing to Democratic incumbent Gary Peters.  The problem was discovered Wednesday morning. Republican state legislator Triston Cole heard of the two votes cast for Representative Jack Bergman in his county that were counted, and responded:  “I can guarantee that there were 6 [Bergman votes] in my immediate family alone.”  Election results are no longer posted on the county’s website, and county authorities released an official statement:  “Early this morning, the Antrim County Clerk, Sheryl Guy, became aware of apparently skewed results in the Unofficial Election Result tabulations.  Since then, the Clerk’s Office has been reviewing the results and the multiple redundancies to search out any possible discrepancies. Staff is currently working with township officials and with Election Source, the company that provides the voting software programs and hardware.”  Sheryl Guy reported that vote totals on printed tabulator tapes and totals counted by the election software did not match. The printed tabulated tapes from each precinct will now be counted manually as a result.  There have been more than 16,000 votes cast in Antrim County.  Michigan Republican party chairperson Laura Cox stated:  “The irregularities reported this morning are incredibly troubling, especially given how close the election results are in Michigan.”  On Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed suit against the state of Michigan, claiming poll observers had been denied access to polling sites.  Trump campaign statement on #Michigan lawsuit pic.twitter.com/T7FSfp3MVA — Team Trump (Text VOTE to 88022) (@TeamTrump) November 4, 2020  Like neighboring state Wisconsin, Michigan is claiming record voter turnout – a claim that draws both pride and skepticism. Reports and rumors of tons of ballots mysteriously appearing in the middle of the night have cast doubt on these turnout claims.  Officially, Michigan is claiming that more than 5,260,000 citizens have voted.  Challengers to election results for and against both parties have arrived at polling locations in the state. The TCF Convention Center is Detroit is ground zero for these groups, with about 50 challengers representing the Republicans. Other groups include the ACLU, NAACP, and union group representatives.  Branden Snyder, executive director of Detroit Action, a housing and economic justice group stated:  “We got a call that they needed more volunteers. Our goal is to make sure the process is fair and equal.”  It is unknown on what authority Mr. Snyder used in his action afterwards, but when more than 100 opposing challengers arrived at the TCF Center, he turned them away for the day.  In other election irregularities, the United States Postal Service (USPS) failed to comply with a federal court order, effectively ignoring the order. The USPS indicated that it couldn’t meet the 3 p.m. deadline set by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan for facilities to sweep their buildings for mail-in ballots.  As judge orders USPS to do twice-daily sweeps for remaining ballots, @APWUnational president says postal workers “moved heaven and earth” to count the record mail-in ballots “as a civic duty.” https://t.co/cB1cVIbEMq — Dinah Voyles Pulver (@DinahVP) November 6, 2020  The USPS also failed to comply with an order to allow election inspectors to inspect mail service in places like Detroit to make sure all mailed in ballots had been deposited at election drop-off sites.  Postmaster General Louis DeJoy filed a response to Judge Sullivan’s order, indicating the service didn’t have enough inspectors to cover the task.  USPS processed 150,000 ballots after Election Day, jeopardizing thousands of votes https://t.co/RDW0V0Nwpo — Bo Snerdley (@BoSnerdley) November 6, 2020  There will certainly be a discussion and possible sanctions over the “apparent lack of compliance with the Court’s order,” according to an after-action order filed by Sullivan.  He did acknowledge the USPS postmaster’s efforts and would likely let them continue their operation in reference to the election.

John James campaign accusing local officials of voter suppression and election interference in Michigan Senate race  November 5, 2020  DETROIT, MI- As Michigan continued to count ballots the day after Election Day, Republican John James’ Senate campaign accused local officials of impropriety, voter suppression, and election interference after incumbent Gary Peters picked up hundreds of thousands of votes overnight.  John James Campaign Claims Irregularities in Michigan Senate Race https://t.co/10NvXMvL1D — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 5, 2020  Fox News reported that James’ allegations came as chaos unfolded outside a vote tally room at the TCF Center in downtown Detroit where all mail-in absentee ballots were being collected. The chaos caused officials to place cardboard over the window in order to obstruct the public’s view as well as bar individuals from coming into the room.  Stuart Sandler, a consultant for James’ campaign, who also observed the count as a volunteer lawyer, told Fox News that they believe there were “a lot of irregularities” throughout the process that must be looked into. Sandler said in a statement:  “There were all kinds of chicanery, including ballots that came in reportedly in the middle of the night at 3:30 a.m. 35,000 ballots that were deceptively brought in.”  He added:  “There have been a lot of irregularities and lack of integrity. They’re not letting challengers in, they’re not letting them get food or water. When they do, they’re not letting them come back. There are all sorts of disruptions to the process.”  John James campaign alleges irregularities, lack of integrity in Michigan vote counthttps://t.co/HniuNxpg8R — Fox News (@FoxNews) November 5, 2020  Up until the early mornings hours on Wednesday, November 4, James was holding a significant lead. Sandler has alleged that Mark Brewer, a former state Democratic chairman, organized the arrival of dozens of lawyers and activists to the TCF Center in order to “disrupt the process.” Sandler said:  “There’s a lack of integrity there. The people of Michigan made their choice and they’ve been trying to disrupt the process and we’re reviewing our options.”  Michigan’s Republican Senate Campaign for John James Alleges Election Interference https://t.co/VEgc0lZLQC — Dr. Carol M.

He said in a statement to the Associated Press:  “This is the best absentee ballot counting operation that Detroit has ever had. They are counting ballots very efficiently, despite the obstructing tactics of the Republicans.”  Still, a source close to James’ campaign said:  “Poll challengers weren’t even able to get close enough to the ballot for the voter rolls to confirm that the ballots are credible, that people didn’t already vote.”  .@GaryPeters laughed out loud when asked what he makes of @JohnJamesMI campaign allegations of irregularities with election results.

However, by the morning of November 4th, a sourced alleged that that total increased to 5.6 million with the majority going up in places like Detroit.  As the Trump campaign lawsuit is dismissed, Republican Senate candidate John James called for an investigation into election results, refusing to concede.https://t.co/P3iOiZLibO — The Michigan Daily (@michigandaily) November 5, 2020  Former State Sen. Patrick Colbeck, who is a registered poll watcher and was on the scene, told Fox News that what he witnessed was an “obfuscation and a complete lack of transparency.” He said in a statement:  “We’re being expressly denied the access to the ballot count area, at the most critical time. And you know, it’s very telling.”  He added:  “I can tell you right now, it’s not a free and fair election and I’ve been watching this for quite a while. So, get the word out, Democrats are attempting to steal the election and the best way to go off and fight back on this is to let people know what’s happening.”  Wow! It looks like Michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man, John James, out of the U.S. Senate. What a terrible thing is happening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020  The complaints from the James campaign follow the announcement from President Donald Trump’s campaign also alleging a lack of access to counting stations. Trump 2020 campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said in a statement:  “President Trump’s campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law.”  _________  Want to make sure you never miss a story from Law Enforcement Today?

2f4df790,Closing The Mexico Border Would Affect The U.S. Avocado Supply Greatly,"UPDATE: April 3, 2019, 2:50 PM  Bloomberg reports Hass Avocado prices surged Tuesday as the result of importers stockpiling produce. However, things may get worse. Vice president and senior analyst at Rabobank, Roland Fumasi, told Bloomberg that prices could ""easily double or triple if we shut down the border.""  ORIGINAL STORY: April 1, 2019, 3:40 P.M.  As President Trump continues his threats to close the border, analysts are looking at how that would impact Americans' food supply. In a report published today, Reuters cited recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture that says nearly half of all imported vegetables and 40 percent of imported fruits are grown in Mexico.  While there are other countries that produce the fruits and vegetables we consume, it would take time to adjust trade plans. One of the most imminent problems we'd face would be an avocado shortage, should the border actually close in the next week.  Steve Barnard, the president of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world, told Reuters that because Mexico supplies most of the avocados sold in the U.S. at this time of year, closing the border would mean running out of avocados in as little as three weeks.  California's growing season is just starting, so avocados grown there wouldn't be ready for another month or so. Of note, Barnard told Reuters that California has a ""very small crop."" Depending on how long trade was halted, that could mean fewer avocados in stores and higher prices on the ones that are available.  Other produce that could be in short supply include tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries, and raspberries, the majority of which all currently come from Mexico.

30c605a1,"CDC Exposed: Inflated Covid Deaths By 1600% Throughout The Election, “Violated Multiple Federal Laws” Peer-Reviewed Study Finds...State, Local Governments Must Act","Throughout the election, Donald Trump was battered by CCP Virus statistics in order to hurt the American economy and his political campaign. We know that it was shamelessly wielded as a political weapon to prevent President Trump and his supporters from rallying as Antifa and Black Lives Matter burned progressive poor and minority neighborhoods to the ground throughout the entire year. Now that Biden has been installed into the office of president, he promises to increase Covid lockdown measures and extend them further into your ability to travel and force unscientific mask-wearing for at least 100 days.  But, a new peer reviewed study has been released that finds the CDC numbers to be so wildly unsupported as to be pure propaganda that is based on wholly unscientific practices that were needlessly created on-the-spot.  The National File Reports  “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE.  CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson.”  The study is 25 pages long with over 100 citations. However, the main main points can be summarized.  A major point is that testing inaccuracies and unreliability combined with unscientific procedures and methods resulted in demonstrably massive false-positive spikes:  “The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. (READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine).”  There are also profound legal implications raised by the study that need to be dealt with in courts around the country if America is to ever be free again. The data you have been spoonfed by the CDC for a year raises serious legal issues. Much like the 2020 election, massive changes in rules for reporting and collecting data were instituted exclusively for Covid which resulted in a 1600% inflated number of fatalities:  “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study.  “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.”  But that is not all. Other major Covid collection and reporting standards created on March 24th of 2020 that inexplicably and intentionally changed decades old practices in order to hide comorbidities and preexisting health conditions on death reports. These underlying health conditions may likely have been the actual or most important cause of death:  “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  And, still, there is MORE! Last spring the CDC created covid-19-exclusive rules that violated federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development and wrote new rules to count probable cases without any definitive proof of infection. The new rules also allowed tracers to practice medicine without a license while disallowing any measures to be put in place to prevent a patient from being counted multiple times:  “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection (section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5), new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license (section VII.A3 – page 5), and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case (section VII.B – page 7),” stated All Concerned Citizens.  Why would those in power wish to do such inhumane things to the entire population of America?  The National File concludes:  “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.”  There is much more to the report, and we suggest that you read it at the link provided in the beginning of this article.  All data since last year suggest that Covid-19 hysteria is part of an orchestrated coup against Western values, nations, and laws.  At what point will the evidence and data be enough to break the spell cast on millions of Americans by the Covid Cult?  Please, bring this report to your local officials and insist that they read it and reverse the policies being implemented and ramped up across the country or America is surely dead.",FALSE
1abdbb0e,"Rep. Vos, Sen. Fitzgerald: Gov. Evers’ plan provides roadblocks to reopening Wisconsin","Madison, WI…Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) released the following statement after the Evers administration announced guidelines for reopening the state.  “Instead of listening to the resounding outcry from the people of the state, Governor Evers is now making it harder to reopen Wisconsin. He claims to be following the CDC guidelines, but instead is expanding on them, saying we need to hire 1000 new contract tracers when positive cases aren’t significantly increasing. The governor also wants to postpone reopening until we increase testing when we are currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity. These are not criteria for reopening, they’re roadblocks.  “While DHS reports that 60% of counties have fewer than 10 cases, and 10% have none, Governor Evers is doubling down on his plan to keep the entire state locked down until after Memorial Day, well past every state in the region.  “We continue to call on the governor to retreat from his one-size-fits-all approach and allow the state to safely open up regionally so people can get back to work. Wisconsin is a diverse state; obviously, the Northwoods can’t be treated like Dane and Milwaukee counties. Using the CDC guidelines, it appears portions of the state would be only days away from the first phase of reopening.  “Wisconsinites need certainty during these uncertain times. As we have seen too often throughout the pandemic, the governor says something one day and the opposite the next. That is why we can’t afford to withdraw our impending legal action. Too much is at stake. It’s clear one person shouldn’t be allowed to unilaterally rule over businesses, families and the state’s future.”",partially false
9332ac22,Flu Vaccine Deaths in South Korea risen to nearly 100; Prime Minister asks for Investigation,"After the Korean Medical Association had called on Seoul to stop the flu vaccination program for a review, South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun finally called for an investigation for the safety issues. This is because the death toll in South Korea after getting flu vaccines has rose to 97; as reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) last week.  The KDCA, however, still denies that there is a connection between these seemingly genocidal phenomena and the vaccines being used in the government’s free flu shot program. What’s more disturbing is that the KCDA still urges the SK citizens to continue getting vaccination despite the growing number of dead flu vaccine recipients.  To some, this is not surprising for an institution like the KCDA. Such organizations claiming to be in charge of diseases control and prevention, while ironically tainted with conflicts of interest, have been proven to be untrustworthy and deceiving when it comes to science many times in history. For example, a report from Children’s Health Defence (CHD) website stated the following:  “The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone aged six months and up, including pregnant women, get an annual flu shot to protect against the influenza virus. The mainstream media characterize this recommendation as being firmly grounded in science. The demonstrable truth of the matter, however, is that what the government and media say science says and what science actually tells us are two completely different things.”  What’s more diabolical is that they even recommend this flu vaccine to pregnant women! On the same report, the CHD website also wrote:  “The CDC’s recommendation that pregnant women get the flu shot is all the more disturbing given the fact that multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine contain the preservative Thimerosal, which is half ethylmercury by weight. Ethylmercury is a known neurotoxin that can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. It can also cross the placental barrier and enter the brain of the developing fetus.”  Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the flu vaccine being used to the SK citizens has contributed or probably the main cause of death. Even if the manufacturers and the state health departments often deny it, common sense would tell us that substances containing heavy metals such as mercury and aluminium, not to mention dozens of other questionable and alarming agents in the vaccine, are very detrimental and should not be put in a human’s body.  For instance, during the last year’s United Nation (UN) summit regarding vaccination, doctors and other experts admitted that there has been no proof that vaccines are safe and effective. In a report published in the naturalnews.com, Dr. Stephen Evans, a Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology stated in the video:  “It seems to me that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to, and that is their intention. It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity (vaccine adverse reactions and side effects) in many instances, and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen…”  Despite the claims by the proponents of vaccines, a peer-reviewed study reveals that unvaccinated people are most protected against influenza (flu). In one of its numerous reports about flu vaccines, globalresearch.ca wrote:  “At least six separate studies conducted by the same people that are still pushing the flu shot have confirmed that seasonal flu shots make people more prone to contracting the flu. The evidence is now overwhelming that, rather than impart immunity as long claimed, flu shots actually destroy the immune system and increase the risk of infection.”  References:  Featured image: https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/deaths-rattle-south-korea-s-seasonal-flu-vaccination-but-authority-presses-ahead-free",partially false
1f33d253,UN Forced to Admit Gates-funded Vaccine Is Causing Polio Outbreak in Africa - Global Research,"This really should be one of the biggest public health scandals of the decade, but instead it’s given little attention – mainly because of the high-profile nature of the people and organisations involved.  ***  The United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing a deadly outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out.  While international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO) will regularly boast about ‘eradicating polio’ with vaccines—the opposite seems to be the case, with vaccines causing the deaths of scores of young people living in Africa.  Health officials have now admitted that their plan to stop ‘wild’ polio is backfiring, as scores children are being paralyzed by a deadly strain of the pathogen derived from a live vaccine – causing a virulent wave of polio to spread.  This latest pharma-induced pandemic started out in the African countries of Chad and Sudan, with the culprit identified as vaccine-derived polio virus type 2.  Officials now fear this new dangerous strain could soon ‘jump continents,’ causing further deadly outbreaks around the world.  Shocking as it sounds, this Big Pharma debacle is not new. After spending some $16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio, international health bodies have ‘accidentally’ reintroduced the disease to in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also Iran, as the central Asia region was hit by a virulent strain of polio spawned by the a pharmaceutical vaccine. Also, in 2019, the government of Ethiopia ordered the destruction of 57,000 vials of type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) following a similar outbreak of vaccine-induced polio.  The same incident has happened in India as well.  It’s important to note that the oral polio vaccine is being pushed by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a consortium which is supported and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  All of this should be cause for concern, especially with western governments and transnational pharmaceutical giants all rushing to roll-out their new Gates-funded experimental coronavirus vaccine for the global population.  Currently, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccine is being tested on the African populationthrough GAVI Vaccine Alliance, another organization funded by the Gates Foundation. A large round of human trials is taking place in South Africa, run by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg—another Gates-funded institution.  This latest revelation from Africa should prompt journalists and health advocates to ask harder questions about the efficacy and safety of the much-hype COVID ‘miracle’ vaccine.  AP News reports…  LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad — a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan — one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea — were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. “There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad,” the U.N. agency said, adding that genetic sequencing confirmed numerous introductions of the virus into Sudan from Chad. WHO said it had found 11 additional vaccine-derived polio cases in Sudan and that the virus had also been identified in environmental samples. There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient. The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water and most often strikes children under 5. In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. Last week, WHO and partners declared that the African continent was free of the wild polio virus, calling it “an incredible and emotional day.” On Monday, WHO warned that the risk of further spread of the vaccine-derived polio across central Africa and the Horn of Africa was “high,” noting the large-scale population movements in the region. More than a dozen African countries are currently battling outbreaks of polio caused by the virus, including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many of the large-scale vaccination campaigns needed to stamp out polio have been disrupted across Africa and elsewhere, leaving millions of children vulnerable to infection. In April, WHO and its partners reluctantly recommended a temporary halt to mass polio immunization campaigns, recognizing the move could lead to a resurgence of the disease. In May, they reported that 46 campaigns to vaccinate children against polio had been suspended in 38 countries, mostly in Africa, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the campaigns have recently been re-started, but health workers need to vaccinate more than 90% of children in their efforts to eradicate the paralytic disease. Health officials had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, a deadline repeatedly pushed back and missed. Wild polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan; both countries also are struggling to contain outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio.  *  Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

On the panel, Missouri Republican Party Executive Director Jean Evans and attorney Jane Dueker talked crime in St. Louis, among other topics.  “Missouri, in general, has more crime, percentage-wise, than the rest of the country. So we are seeing overall crime throughout the country is going down but not here in Missouri,” said Evans.  Last week marked the official launch of Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to combat violent crime in the region. The same week, St. Louis elected officials passed the Cure Violence plan.  To Evans, Parson stepping in “takes political courage” and puts much-needed boots on the ground.  “Freeing up some more police officers, because you don’t go in and rob a bank when there is a cop car outside,” Evans said.  Dueker noted the police officers “are grateful for any sort of help.”  But, that is just one step to addressing the issue, she said.  “I think you have to do a multifaceted approach, and I’m not exactly seeing that yet. The bottom line is the most dangerous people have to be taken off the streets,” Dueker said. “You have to have a short-term solution, a medium-term solution, and a long-term solution. The short-term solution has to be to get the most dangerous people off the streets. Ten percent of the people are committing 90 percent of the crime. … We need, one, to get them off the street, and then we need someone who will actually prosecute them to keep them in.”  Tune in for the whole show as guests discuss an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, the special election in HD 99, and protections for pregnant women in prison.",partially false
d72c2323,BLM Has Rules for Whites Attending Protests,"0 SHARES Share Tweet  BLM pasted these “rules” for “white folks” attending protests on social media. Many whites wanted to stand in unity with their fellow blacks to protest the unjust killing of George Floyd’s.  In a moment of unity, these rules seem more degrading and racist towards white people. Among some of the rules, they request whites to “stay in the back until you are called forward. If you hear “White people to the front” or “Allies to the front” step forward and link arms with other white people to form a human shield.”  So they asked that all whites stay in the back and link arms with other whites, not blacks.  Seems those that are crying for equality don’t want equality, they want superiority over whites.  Unity is when we unite side by side together in a common goal. So why would they not use this moment to show that we can all one?  BLM Mohawk Kuzma said this in 2014:  “As organizer of the largest Black Lives Matter marches in Seattle since 2014, Mohawk Kuzma has had a front-row seat to the transforming demographics of the BLM movement. He says that my eyes are not deceiving me. There is a noticeable increase of white marchers, one that he says signifies that white Seattleites’ long hibernation on Black issues is at its end.  “The reason BLM marches are getting more white is because more white people are waking up and seeing the covert segregation and racial injustice and racism,” Kuzma tells me. “We see it on the news every day across the nation.”  He draws a connection with the overt displays of racism, from pervasive police killings of blacks to the recent domestic terrorist acts by white supremacists, most recently a school shooting by one in New Mexico  Kuzma says that when he began organizing he welcomed whatever race, gender, or orientation felt compelled to attend, as long as the marchers understood “that all black lives matter and racial injustice, police brutality, and racism needed to stop.”  However, he also recognizes that the increased numbers of white folks is a double-edged sword.  “More white people also brings white ignorance and white fragility,” he says. “White people think they have to be respectful during a protest. Sorry, but we as black people don’t get respect from anyone, including white people, so why should we be respectful. We are here to get stuff done.”  During the Civil War, it was white people that fought for the freedom of slaves. At that time the north had 22 million people against slavery while the south had 9 million. 4 million of them were slaves. It was white people that ran the underground railroad. It has always true that more white people are fighting for equal rights than not. Though many seem to want to overlook this historical fact.  This movement is an American movement and we should have mutual respect for each other. We should treat each other how we expect to be treated.

c03ed5db,Canadian Govt Publishes Bid Request For “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” Needed “in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19”,"Is Canada building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit? As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing…  by Mike Adams of Natural News  (Natural News) The Canadian government, on its official acquisition website (Buyandsell.gc.ca) is requesting bids for “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” as part of, “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.”  The listing number is 45045-190091/A, and it is found at this link:  https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-PD-005-78707  Additional details on the bid include:  Reference number: PW-$$PD-005-78707  Solicitation number: 45045-190091/A  Region of delivery: National Capital Region  Notice type: Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP)  GSIN: N7520: Office Devices and Accessories  Procurement entity: Public Works and Government Services Canada  The “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” listing on the Canadian government’s website is explained on the site as “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.”  “Guillotine” is a term that describes a mechanical device with a powerful chopping blade that can slice things apart. Although there are industrial uses for cutting devices — such as in the book publishing industry — the term “guillotine” specifically refers to a device intended to execute human beings.  As the Cambridge online dictionary explains, “guillotine” is a device that’s used to kill people by cutting off their heads:  Here’s an image of a paper cutting machine, which is more commonly called a “shear” or cutting machine. This is not a guillotine, even though paper cutting companies might be used as a front for acquiring actual guillotines:  Antifa and left-wing BLM terrorists have recently displayed mock-up guillotines on the streets of America as part of their protest actions, demanding that the people with whom they disagree be executed via guillotine. Guillotines were also used in the French Revolution to execute political dissidents who opposed the incoming socialist regime.  Canadian official asks why covid camps are being constructed in Canada, gets silenced  It is difficult to imagine how guillotines would be needed to respond to COVID-19 unless Canada was building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit to mass vaccinations. As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing. See this article: Canadian government erecting a network of covid detainment camps and “isolation” sites to incarcerate those who don’t cooperate with medical tyranny. As that article explains:  Justin Trudeau and the Canadian government are creating Nazi Germany-like infrastructure to detain human beings en masse, and for years to come. A brave Ontario politician named Randy Hillier spoke out about the government’s nefarious detainment plan in a provincial question period in front of the government of Ontario. His microphone was cut off as soon as he started asking the tough questions.  Randy Hillier, Independent Ontario MPP for Lanark, Frontenac and Kingston, stood up and questioned the government, asking how many people will be detained and how many concentration camps are scheduled for construction. He expressed concern about their current use — to control the spread of covid-19 — and pointed out in documentation that these sites could be used for “other requirements” in the future.  “So your government must be in negotiations and aware of these plans to potentially detain and isolate citizens and residents of our country and our province,” Hillier began. “So speaker, to the Premier, where will these camps be built, how many people will be detained, and for what reason, for what reasons can people be kept in these isolation camps, and I’d like to have the Premier assure the people of Ontario…,” Hillier’s microphone was cut off before he could finish.  See the video here, which has been banned from YouTube:  Additional details on the hydraulic guillotines request from the Canadian government  Solicitation document #ABES.PROD.PW__PD.B005.E78707.EBSU000 reveals additional details about the bid request:  The bid document lists technical requirements for the guillotines, under a heading called “Guillotines Mandatory Requirements:”  The Guillotine’s cutting and clamping systems must be fully hydraulic;  The Guillotine’s automatic blade and clamp must return from every position to its original  starting position;  starting position; The Guillotine’s blade depth adjustment(s) must be achievable from outside of the  Guillotine;  Guillotine; The Guillotine’s measurement readout must be in imperial measurement;  The Guillotine’s blade changing tool, wrenches/screwdrivers and cutting block must be  provided for each Guillotine;  The document also calls for a “1 year parts and labour warranty” to make sure the guillotine continues running smoothly so that the chopping isn’t interrupted.  Is this bid for industrial use, or something more sinister?  A skeptic might look at this government bid and conclude it must be a bid for cutting equipment to be used in cutting books, stacks of papers or posters. One of the companies involved in the bid appears to be a printing company, for example. But wouldn’t that also be the perfect cover story for acquiring actual guillotines intended for a more sinister purpose?  Given that Canada is already in the process of constructing covid “concentration camps” — while touting this guillotine bid as part of “Canada’s response to COVID-19,” many people will have serious questions about the intended use of these devices as well as the language used to describe them.  If these were merely industrial cutting machines, wouldn’t the listing just say, “Cutting Machine” instead of “Guillotines?”  And given the history of guillotines being used during radical left-wing revolutions in France, many people are wondering whether China’s corruption of modern-day Canada — including its French-speaking regions — means that China is planning to round up and execute anyone resisting communist influences in Canada. With Justin Trudeau now appearing to be a political puppet of China — much like Joe Biden — and with Chinese troops already staged in Western Canada, these are no longer idle questions.  See this important story: Western Canada has already fallen to Communist China – America may have a chance, but only if it stands united.  Dave Hodges of The Commonsense Show recently published an article describing plans to round up Americans and incarcerate them in Canadian concentration camps run by communist Chinese. That article explains:  Steve Quayle and myself have been investigating a three-nation deal involving Communist China, Canada and the United States. The deal has now expanded to NATO forces, living in American bases that were closed during the Bush Sr., era. The CSS has also learned that their is some UN involvement as well. The agreements have to do with ridding America’s new Harris-Biden administration of any and all. Unfortunately, the interview that is presented below on this topic is a work in progress. The implications of this interview is frightening as it promises an international, state-sponsored genocidal program against “deplorables” who will oppose the real new world order.  As all this is happening, Trudeau is accelerating Canada’s gun control and gun confiscation efforts to make sure that Canadian citizens have no ability to fight back when the government comes to their homes and kidnaps them, depositing them in Canada’s COVID concentration camps.  Americans, on the other hand, will never give up their guns. Count on it.",FALSE
a329a5b3,"Josh Mandel discloses finances, showing his wife with extensive holdings in a trust","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 2012, on Friday released a copy of his delinquent personal financial disclosure report, a 47-page document showing his wife to be a millionaire with extensive investments held in a family trust.  At a minimum, Ilana Shafran Mandel's holdings are worth $1.95 million. But they could be worth as much as $7.1 million, based on a range of valuations in her husband's financial disclosure report.  Annual income from the trust was at least $860,000 last year and could have been as high as $1.8 million, thanks to dividends, capital gains, rent from real estate and distributions from gas and natural resource partnerships  Mandel's personal financial report was due to the Senate clerk on May 15, little more than a month after he signed candidacy papers on April 5. But he said the complexity and structure of his wife's finances presented questions he needed to resolve in order to file the form correctly. He said the $200 fine he'll have to pay under Senate rules is a fair price for accuracy.  Democrats derided the presumptive GOP Senate nominee for his continued lateness, suggesting he might be hiding something. Keenly aware of the criticism, the Mandel campaign hand-delivered the report to reporters around midday Friday -- yet kept Democrats who wanted to pore over it waiting by choosing to submit it to the Senate via mail. The Senate is likely to receive it early next week.  This frustrated Democratic activists who were waiting for the filing to show up at the Senate clerk's office by the 6 p.m. Friday closing time.  ""For nearly six months Josh Mandel broke the law and illegally refused to disclose his personal finances despite every other major Senate candidate in the country being in compliance, and now in an effort to continue his evasion tactics, he files a report which is still not yet available to the public on the weekend before the biggest election in the country this year,"" said Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky.  Based on the copy of the report released to the press, the overwhelming majority of Mandel assets are held for his wife in the JMS Trust -- short for the Joseph M. Shafran Children's Trust. Joseph Shafran is Ilana's father, and his mother -- Ilana's grandmother -- was an immigrant who with her siblings founded a lumber business that grew into Forest City Enterprises. Today, Ilana's trust-held stock in Forest City, a publicly traded company, is worth anywhere from $315,003 to $650,000.  Her other stock holdings through the trust are extensive and include Avon Products, General Electric, J. P. Morgan Chase, McDonalds, Microsoft, Sherwin-Williams and Time Warner. The trust also has an array of bond holdings including Bank of America, the Hamilton County Sewer System, and the Medina County Library. It also is invested in mutual funds, real estate, gas and natural resource partnerships, and a small stake in Wicked People Tour Inc., which Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said is related to the Broadway show ""Wicked.""  Mandel, a Marine veteran who expects to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown next year, is not personally wealthy. He reported his income as state treasurer as $82,477, and his personal investments are worth as little as $60,000 or as much as $375,000, excluding a Lyndhurst condo he and his wife rent out, valued between $100,001 and $250,000.  Brown, who filed his annual disclosure report in May, has a small range of holdings worth as little as $435,010 or as much as $1 million, based on the ranges of values in his report.",TRUE
31d33510,"Fact Check: Harris Says Biden Won't Ban Fracking, Video Shows Her and Biden Saying They Would","Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California was caught in a major lie Wednesday night at the 2020 vice presidential debate, directly contradicting a history of promises from her and her running mate to defend against claims a Biden-Harris administration would ban American hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas.  The claim came as Harris sparred with incumbent Vice President Mike Pence over how best to address the issue of climate change.  “Joe Biden will not end fracking,” Harris said. “He has been very clear about that.”  Harris would provide no explanation and no qualifiers, her campaign simply going on to suggest the claim was “fact” in a statement published to Twitter moments later.  .@JoeBiden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 8, 2020  TRENDING: Pompeo Drops Clinton Bombshell: 'We’ve Got the Emails, We’re Getting Them Out'  Of course, the California Democrat’s words flew in the face of multiple statements made on record by her and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden with regard to the topic throughout the course of the wider 2020 election cycle.  According to the Washington Examiner, Harris herself suggested during a town hall hosted by CNN in the heat of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary last September that she would take action to ban hydraulic fracturing on public lands on “day one” if elected president.  “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris told the audience.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, could cost the United States roughly 7.5 million jobs if fulfilled, RealClearEnergy reported, citing the American Petroleum Institute.  It was apparently not radical enough, however, to keep Harris’ running mate, the supposedly moderate Biden, from falling in line as well.  Several sharp-eyed social media users were quick to point out the discrepancy on Twitter, posting several individual videos, and even a few super-cut compilations, of Biden promising there would be “no more, no new fracking” under his administration.

According to The Associated Press, the former vice president promised as much in a “intimate” public moment with a young woman on the trail in New Hampshire last September.  “I want you to look at my eyes.
